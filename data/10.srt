00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,820
MATT: Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical
Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:09,931
sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. First off,
for those of you that are watching the awesome art

3
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:15,050
sizzle, we are excited, We finally got the
opportunity to get our fantastic fan song,

4
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:20,005
'Welcome to Wildemount', by Colm McGuinness, one of
the Critter community and a very talented musician

5
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:23,046
who made that piece. We've been trying to find
a way to incorporate it since he put it up, so

6
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:28,542
we're excited to have that as a lead-in of hype
for the week, so thank you so much, Colm, for

7
00:00:28,542 --> 00:00:35,076
being amazing. You should check out his stuff.
What are you-- Are you kidnapping somebody over there?

8
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,892
SAM: Don't mind me!

9
00:00:36,892 --> 00:00:40,711
(laughter)

10
00:00:40,711 --> 00:00:46,607
MATT: Before we get into the game real fast, let's
go over some announcements. First off, tonight we

11
00:00:46,607 --> 00:00:53,306
have dual sponsors. First, we have our fantastic
returning partners in crime for this campaign, D&D Beyond.

12
00:00:53,306 --> 00:00:56,073
(cheering)

13
00:00:56,073 --> 00:01:01,298
SAM: This week, guys, D&D Beyond is offering up
another discount code for 24-- no, I read that

14
00:01:01,298 --> 00:01:11,206
wrong! 25% off any single purchase in the D&D
Beyond marketplace. Use code "InvisibleWand," not

15
00:01:11,206 --> 00:01:18,068
case-sensitive, at check-out to receive the discount. I've 
done a lot of things to promote D&D Beyond and all of

16
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:24,855
our sponsors. I've done poetry. I've done opera.
I've sung songs. But there's one art form that I

17
00:01:24,855 --> 00:01:27,714
haven't explored... and that's dance.

18
00:01:27,714 --> 00:01:29,484
MARISHA: Yes!

19
00:01:29,484 --> 00:01:36,893
SAM: So tonight I will be performing, with my
invisible wand, a ballet that I wrote to honor

20
00:01:36,893 --> 00:01:42,219
D&D Beyond. I may need a camera person.

21
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:45,752
(laughter)

22
00:01:45,752 --> 00:01:50,742
SAM: Ready? Maestro, please hit it.

23
00:01:50,742 --> 00:01:54,495
[Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy plays]

24
00:01:54,495 --> 00:01:57,583
(laughter)

25
00:01:57,583 --> 00:02:07,221
SAM: (singing, VO) D&D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D,
D, D, D&D Beyond, D&D Beyond, D, D, D, D, D, D, D,

26
00:02:07,221 --> 00:02:20,024
D, D, D, D, D&D Beyond, D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D,
D&D Beyond, D&D Beyond!

27
00:02:20,024 --> 00:02:23,536
(cheering)

28
00:02:23,536 --> 00:02:28,575
TRAVIS: That's something.

29
00:02:28,575 --> 00:02:31,190
MATT: I wasn't prepared for that.

30
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:35,322
SAM: Some things just have to be expressed 
with the human body.

31
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,851
MATT: Of course.

32
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:41,019
LIAM: Every time you open your mouth that wide,
an entire new universe is born.

33
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:44,504
(laughter)

34
00:02:44,504 --> 00:02:55,470
MATT: Wow. So thank you, D&D Beyond, for
facilitating that for us and all the good of the internet.

35
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,890
TRAVIS: What would you do every week without
sponsorships? You would explode.

36
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,596
SAM: I would do this at home.

37
00:03:00,596 --> 00:03:05,738
MATT: He needs an outlet. It's good. It's healthy
for him. Our second sponsor tonight is the

38
00:03:05,738 --> 00:03:12,726
upcoming game-- maybe you played the franchise
before, but we have the Far Cry 5 game, coming up soon.

39
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:15,167
Liam, if you want to talk about that a little
further.

40
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:19,449
LIAM: Oh man, Vax'ildan Vessar here from the
afterlife. You know, most of the time, I sit here

41
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:24,650
in a big black room wondering where the fuck I am
or what's going to happen next. Probably nothing.

42
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:32,108
But once in a while, the Raven Queen hands me a
sheet of paper to help promote projects, and this

43
00:03:32,108 --> 00:03:40,490
week it is Far Cry 5. (clears throat) I got this four minutes
ago. Far Cry 5 is available on March 27th on PS4,

44
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:46,615
Xbox One, and PC. Go to farcry.com-- we don't have
any computers here-- to learn more and pick up a

45
00:03:46,615 --> 00:03:53,892
copy. The latest installment of Far Cry is set in
fictional Hope County, Montana, where a fanatical

46
00:03:53,892 --> 00:04:00,575
doomsday cult known as the Project at Eden's Gate
has taken control. You are the hero of the story

47
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:04,593
in a thrilling world that hits back with every
punch and where the places you discover and the

48
00:04:04,593 --> 00:04:11,300
locals you ally with will shape your story in ways
you'll never see coming. Also, in celebration of

49
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:17,282
the upcoming release, Nerdist's Dan Casey, Kyle
Hill, and Geek & Sundry's own Erika Ishii are filming a

50
00:04:17,282 --> 00:04:22,764
special Far Cry 5 training video where they took
on challenges players will face in-game.

51
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:24,669
MARISHA: Oh, that's cool!

52
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:32,377
LIAM: Shooting, car drifting, dog training and
more. Go to nerdist.com or youtube.com/nerdist to

53
00:04:32,377 --> 00:04:39,442
check it out and tell them Critical Role sent you.
Send me some comic books because I'm really bored here.

54
00:04:39,442 --> 00:04:41,725
MATT: Thank you, Liam.

55
00:04:41,725 --> 00:04:47,496
TRAVIS: As a player of Far Cry 4, it was amazing. I
have higher expectations for 5.

56
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,314
LIAM: The story looks dark.

57
00:04:49,314 --> 00:04:53,524
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's real good. ATVs, baby! Sorry.

58
00:04:53,524 --> 00:05:00,602
MATT: Thank you. And thank you, Far Cry 5, for
sponsoring tonight's game. All right, so, next bit. A

68
00:05:42,978 --> 00:05:50,889
of what tonight's episode is. Anyway, 7:00pm
Pacific American. Our fantastic host, Brian W.

70
00:05:53,073 --> 00:05:54,891
(cheering)

71
00:05:54,891 --> 00:05:56,595
MARISHA: He did it! Nothing.

72
00:05:56,595 --> 00:05:57,487
LAURA: Yeah.

73
00:05:57,487 --> 00:05:59,514
MATT: I literally brainfarted once and it's like
I've always ruined it.

74
00:05:59,614 --> 00:06:01,273
LAURA: No, it's been more than once.

75
00:06:01,273 --> 00:06:03,886
TRAVIS: But good friends never let you forget,
Matt.

76
00:06:03,886 --> 00:06:04,946
MATT: It's true.

77
00:06:04,946 --> 00:06:07,923
LIAM: That is true. Very true.

78
00:06:07,923 --> 00:06:20,093
MATT: So check it out next Tuesday. WonderCon coming
up. We have a Talks Machina Critical Role panel on

79
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:25,709
Sunday, March 25th at 11:30am in the Arena. So if
you guys are in the vicinity and planning

80
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:32,197
to attend WonderCon, please come join us for the 
panel. We all shall be ridiculous as usual and I don't

81
00:06:32,197 --> 00:06:36,258
know if Sam will be up for bringing his box-crotch
onesie from Gen Con last year.

82
00:06:36,258 --> 00:06:39,152
LAURA: Maybe you can do an interpretive dance
there as well?

83
00:06:39,204 --> 00:06:39,928
SAM: Sure.

84
00:06:39,928 --> 00:06:41,867
TALIESIN: Or turn it into an octagon.

85
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:44,748
LIAM: Yeah, or a higher faced die. Like an
eight-sider or a 12-sider.

86
00:06:44,748 --> 00:06:45,687
MATT: That's true.

87
00:06:45,687 --> 00:06:48,139
SAM: Let's really push the envelope of dick
jokes.

88
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:51,494
LAURA: There is no end to dick jokes.

89
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:55,301
MATT: This is true. So hopefully we'll see
some of you guys there.

90
00:06:55,381 --> 00:07:02,343
C2E2 in Chicago also, which is having a-- We
have panels and signings held April 7th and April

91
00:07:02,343 --> 00:07:07,331
8th. You can get your tickets at C2E2.com and
we're excited to see you guys there. I met a bunch

92
00:07:07,331 --> 00:07:13,641
of great "Cwitters"-- Critters-- Some great "Cwitters"
this past weekend in Lexington, Kentucky. You guys were

93
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:18,925
amazing. It was such a great time to interface
with all of you, for those of you who were able to come.

94
00:07:18,925 --> 00:07:22,377
Thank you so much for being patient. I know it was
a wait for a lot of you. It was a joy for me and I

95
00:07:22,377 --> 00:07:25,740
hope it was a joy for you. A lot of you were
saying you were coming to Chicago as well, so I

96
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:33,272
look forward to seeing you there. Let's see. Once
again, 826LA is a fantastic charity that we promote and

97
00:07:33,272 --> 00:07:38,433
push for this. They do great work with 
after-school classes in creative writing for

98
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:42,897
underprivileged teens and children. If you have
the opportunity, look into it and see if you can

99
00:07:42,897 --> 00:07:50,158
provide any sort of funds to what they do or go ahead
and give some time to them. Teach and be part of

100
00:07:50,228 --> 00:07:52,879
that wonderful environment. They're amazing. I
highly recommend you check them out if you

101
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,247
haven't yet.

102
00:07:54,247 --> 00:07:59,228
MARISHA: Taliesin, didn't you say you ran into a
Critter who went and started to do D&D?

103
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,174
TALIESIN: I did. He's starting to do stuff down
there.

104
00:08:01,211 --> 00:08:02,860
MARISHA: I love that. So thank you.

105
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,410
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Yeah.

106
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:07,878
TALIESIN: He was enthusiastic. I'm excited.
It's good stuff.

107
00:08:07,878 --> 00:08:10,466
MARISHA: If he can do it, you can too!

108
00:08:10,466 --> 00:08:12,890
MATT: I believe we have some new merch?

109
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:20,566
(excited noises)

110
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:22,773
LAURA: And look how cute it looks under
overalls.

111
00:08:22,773 --> 00:08:24,873
MARISHA: So cute!

112
00:08:24,873 --> 00:08:29,725
LAURA: Those are in the store right now! As well
as our new CR logo shirt, which nobody is wearing.

113
00:08:29,725 --> 00:08:32,500
SAM: Oh! I need one. I need a large.

114
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,186
LAURA: Okay. I'll get one for you.

115
00:08:34,186 --> 00:08:36,377
SAM: Should I get one in the store? Are they
available?

116
00:08:36,377 --> 00:08:40,254
LAURA: At GeekandSundry.com! The shop! There it
is!

117
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:41,757
ASHLEY: I love that color!

118
00:08:41,757 --> 00:08:42,950
LIAM: It is executive!

119
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:50,265
LAURA: Yeah, it is. It's like the sophisticated
version. Yeah. We have some dice as well as lots

120
00:08:50,265 --> 00:08:52,118
of other merch, so check it out.

121
00:08:52,118 --> 00:08:55,066
ASHLEY: Let's have cruises soon.

122
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:57,578
TRAVIS: Yeah. Let's get our own Sea Org and 
we'll give out ranks.

123
00:08:57,598 --> 00:09:01,055
MATT: No! Nothing like Sea Org, please!

124
00:09:01,055 --> 00:09:03,583
LIAM: We're just getting over being sick! No
cruises!

125
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:09,268
MATT: Well, anybody have anything else they want
to say or shall we dive in?

126
00:09:09,268 --> 00:09:11,308
TRAVIS: I like Girl Scout cookies.

127
00:09:11,308 --> 00:09:16,832
MATT: All right. And on that note, let's go ahead 
and dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role!

128
00:09:16,832 --> 00:09:22,221
[click, TV static]

[groovy Critical Role theme]

130
00:10:41,114 --> 00:10:42,215
MATT: And wel--

131
00:10:42,215 --> 00:10:48,250
(laughter)

132
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:52,683
ASHLEY: I was going to say it, but I thought it was--
I'm out of practice!

133
00:10:52,683 --> 00:11:01,514
MATT: For those who are unaware, Ashley just full-on
ripcorded out of halfway-a-phrase and it was

134
00:11:01,514 --> 00:11:03,854
beautiful. It was adorable.

135
00:11:03,854 --> 00:11:06,232
MARISHA: It could have been so many things.

136
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,474
MATT: So--

137
00:11:07,474 --> 00:11:10,813
ASHLEY: I'll get better at it again. Give me a
minute.

138
00:11:10,813 --> 00:11:20,164
MATT: It's all good. So, last we left off, the
Mighty Nein have been making their rounds in the

139
00:11:20,164 --> 00:11:26,358
city of Zadash, seeking opportunities,
information, getting their bearings amongst the

140
00:11:26,358 --> 00:11:32,834
various townsfolk, streets, and what goings-on
there are. Getting updates from town criers

141
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:37,110
wandering through the roads, speaking with
individuals, going into bathhouses where you met

142
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:45,926
up with your fantastic long-lost barbarian. Yasha
coming in to join alongside you guys in your

143
00:11:46,044 --> 00:11:54,985
exploits. You managed to converse with a meeting,
or at least Beau and Fjord met with a meeting of

144
00:11:54,985 --> 00:12:03,498
unhappy denizens of the Empire discussing their
frustrations beneath the Leaky Tap, and had

145
00:12:03,498 --> 00:12:10,106
crossed some information with them. You had gone
and made some purchases. You had sold off

146
00:12:10,106 --> 00:12:17,369
a few of the things you had acquired in your journeys
northward along the Amber Road. You had decided

147
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:22,548
to, looking for work, go to the King's Hall, where
they had a task board there and had taken one of

148
00:12:22,548 --> 00:12:31,013
the contracts that had been posted. You would be
paid to seek the sewers beneath the city, near the

149
00:12:31,013 --> 00:12:38,712
outskirts of the Tri-Spire area of the town, for
something that had been lurking within those

150
00:12:38,712 --> 00:12:44,364
tunnels below. A couple of guards had not
returned; one had gone there and fled. You were

151
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:49,049
promised a sum of money, should you be able to
exterminate whatever this entity is and bring back

152
00:12:49,049 --> 00:12:57,612
proof of its demise. You jauntily accepted this.
Before this happened, as a part of a journey

153
00:12:57,612 --> 00:13:06,728
towards this Tri-Spire, both Caleb and Jester made
their way there, Caleb unsuccessfully entering a

154
00:13:06,728 --> 00:13:16,214
nicer district of the city that did not seem to
believe or respect his presentation. Jester did

155
00:13:16,214 --> 00:13:22,944
so. She got a room at one of the hoity-toity inns
in the district and was led to some mild

156
00:13:22,944 --> 00:13:29,369
disappointments. Where we left off, the two of you
had reconvened and begun making your way back to

157
00:13:29,369 --> 00:13:35,014
meet up with the rest of your friends at the Leaky
Tap tavern. Probably at a brief distance from each

158
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:41,335
other as Caleb has huffed off, in a bit of
frustration. Eventually, Caleb, you make your way

159
00:13:41,335 --> 00:13:47,793
to the familiar outside of the Leaky Tap. You
enter, the fresh mud now a little bit less fresh

160
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:54,250
and dried against your face, into the interior. At
this point, it's mid-afternoon, there's maybe

161
00:13:54,250 --> 00:14:00,301
about, let's say, nine patrons in there, and a
number of your friends who have been waiting for

162
00:14:00,301 --> 00:14:04,738
the two of you to return that are all sitting around a
table and discussing amongst themselves. The rest

163
00:14:04,738 --> 00:14:09,639
of you guys look across and watch Caleb enter,
and then a few moments after, Jester enters as well.

164
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:13,244
LAURA: Oh, hi.

165
00:14:13,244 --> 00:14:14,909
TRAVIS: How'd you do?

166
00:14:14,909 --> 00:14:20,530
MARISHA: Big money?

167
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:24,807
LAURA: No. Not so much. Not a lot of money.

168
00:14:24,807 --> 00:14:26,547
TRAVIS: Lots of gifts, then?

169
00:14:26,547 --> 00:14:28,292
LAURA: No.

170
00:14:28,292 --> 00:14:30,087
MARISHA: Jewels?

171
00:14:30,087 --> 00:14:39,174
LAURA: No. Nothing really. But I saw the Traveler,
so that's good news, everyone. He's still

172
00:14:39,174 --> 00:14:43,937
around, he's here. He's probably hanging out 
with us right now.

173
00:14:44,004 --> 00:14:46,488
TRAVIS: He's in Zadash? Like, staying here?

174
00:14:46,488 --> 00:14:49,105
LAURA: Yes. Well, probably, yes.

175
00:14:49,105 --> 00:14:53,405
TRAVIS: Isn't that hard since he's not technically
recognized?

176
00:14:53,405 --> 00:14:57,192
SAM: Should you be talking about him out in the
open like that?

177
00:14:57,192 --> 00:15:03,535
LAURA: Well, not a lot of people know who he is yet, so
really, no, I don't think I'll get in trouble.

178
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,550
SAM: He's a new god?

179
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:16,178
LAURA: Well, I don't know if he's new, but he is just
not well-known, especially here. I'm sure where

180
00:15:16,247 --> 00:15:21,649
he's from everybody knows him because he's
really cool, so I bet a lot of people are like,

181
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:23,442
"Oh my god, I love you!"

182
00:15:23,442 --> 00:15:26,038
TRAVIS: He plays lots of local clubs. Yeah.

183
00:15:26,038 --> 00:15:27,307
LAURA: Yes, basically.

184
00:15:27,307 --> 00:15:29,050
TRAVIS: Up and coming. Enjoying a resurgence.

185
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,875
MARISHA: And you're sure he's a god?

186
00:15:31,945 --> 00:15:38,390
LAURA: Yeah! Yeah, he's really cool. He's so
powerful. You guys should really see what he can

187
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,305
do, because it's amazing.

188
00:15:40,305 --> 00:15:42,397
SAM: Give us a hint.

189
00:15:42,397 --> 00:15:54,170
LAURA: Well, he can do lots of magic, and he can
appear out of nowhere. That's cool.

190
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,272
SAM: That is cool!

191
00:15:55,272 --> 00:15:57,071
TRAVIS: Were you with anyone when he showed up?

192
00:15:57,071 --> 00:15:58,778
LAURA: No.

193
00:15:58,778 --> 00:16:03,464
TRAVIS: Do you think he'd want to meet us? Or
introduce us, maybe?

194
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:06,823
LAURA: I can ask him! Yeah!

195
00:16:06,823 --> 00:16:11,569
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm really interested in a god that
kicks it with people.

196
00:16:11,569 --> 00:16:12,938
TRAVIS and LAURA: Yeah.

197
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:14,378
MARISHA: I've never heard of that.

198
00:16:14,378 --> 00:16:20,604
LAURA: Well, Traveler, you heard it yourself! If
you like everyone here, you can just show up anytime!

199
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:24,954
TRAVIS: Perception check.

200
00:16:24,954 --> 00:16:27,775
MATT: Make a perception check.

201
00:16:27,775 --> 00:16:31,025
TRAVIS: First one! That's an 11.

202
00:16:31,025 --> 00:16:31,832
MATT: 11?

203
00:16:31,832 --> 00:16:33,378
TRAVIS: Yeah.

204
00:16:33,489 --> 00:16:41,168
MATT: You look around the room and nothing seems
to apparate. The clientele all seem disinterested

205
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:51,258
with your presence. There's nothing that would
belie any arrival of an entity she spoke of.

206
00:16:51,258 --> 00:16:54,538
TRAVIS: (whispering) I don't think he's here.

207
00:16:54,538 --> 00:16:59,233
LAURA: Well, it's possible he's just invisible right
now. He does that sometimes.

208
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:00,503
TRAVIS: That is problematic.

209
00:17:00,503 --> 00:17:01,265
TALIESIN: Incognito.

210
00:17:01,265 --> 00:17:02,045
LAURA: Yeah.

211
00:17:02,045 --> 00:17:07,688
LIAM: I mean, it is not totally unheard of. The
legends in history are full of stories of the gods

212
00:17:07,688 --> 00:17:15,141
dabbling with mortals. I don't know what happened
for you today, but-- it is not common, but it does happen.

213
00:17:15,141 --> 00:17:16,704
LAURA: Yeah, it happens.

214
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:17,713
TRAVIS: Well.

215
00:17:17,713 --> 00:17:20,894
ASHLEY: He shows up to you as a man? Or how does
that work?

216
00:17:20,894 --> 00:17:27,941
LAURA: Yeah! You know, he's just this guy. I don't
know exactly what he looks like, because he's got

217
00:17:27,941 --> 00:17:29,144
this hood.

218
00:17:29,144 --> 00:17:31,027
TRAVIS: A hood?

219
00:17:31,027 --> 00:17:34,483
LAURA: I imagine that he's really handsome.

220
00:17:34,483 --> 00:17:36,847
ASHLEY: Okay.

221
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:42,256
LAURA: I think he's really cute. He sounds really
cute. He can probably hear me right now. I'm so

222
00:17:42,256 --> 00:17:43,856
embarrassed!

223
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:47,660
(laughter)

224
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:51,354
LIAM: Hello, guy.

225
00:17:51,354 --> 00:17:55,514
LAURA: Right? Maybe he'll start talking to you
too!

226
00:17:55,514 --> 00:17:59,829
MARISHA: Maybe Molly can do a seance and he'll
come out!

227
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:06,036
LAURA: Oh, well he might get-- you know what? He
might think that's really fun. That could be fun.

228
00:18:06,036 --> 00:18:11,107
TALIESIN: I don't normally speak with the dead on
a first date, but we'll think about it.

229
00:18:11,107 --> 00:18:18,047
TRAVIS: Yasha, do you have any kind of
communication with your--

230
00:18:18,047 --> 00:18:28,049
ASHLEY: I mean, I certainly don't see him in the
flesh, so no.

231
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:30,118
SAM: But do you talk to him?

232
00:18:30,118 --> 00:18:32,237
ASHLEY: Yes, of course.

233
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:34,257
MARISHA: Does he talk back?

234
00:18:34,257 --> 00:18:39,119
ASHLEY: Not exactly.

235
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:43,287
LAURA: Maybe you have to get somewhere really
quiet, because the first time I heard the Traveler

236
00:18:43,287 --> 00:18:45,097
it was super duper quiet.

237
00:18:45,097 --> 00:18:49,472
ASHLEY: That's a good idea, actually. That's a
good idea.

238
00:18:49,472 --> 00:18:54,247
LAURA: Fjord, can I ask you a question?

239
00:18:54,247 --> 00:18:55,998
TRAVIS: Yes.

240
00:18:55,998 --> 00:19:06,233
LAURA: Do you remember how long it took us to get
from Port Damali to the border into--

241
00:19:06,233 --> 00:19:13,863
TRAVIS: I don't think it was more than a few days.
I don't recall exactly. Do I recall exactly?

242
00:19:13,863 --> 00:19:22,979
MATT: You do. From Port Damali to the southern
gates of the Empire and the Wuyun Gorge, on foot--

243
00:19:22,979 --> 00:19:28,042
which you guys were traveling on foot-- it took you
about the better part of two weeks. You passed

244
00:19:28,111 --> 00:19:31,820
through Nicodranas-- or you didn't pass through
Nicodranas, but you went through along the road and

245
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,931
skirted along the side. You took the road pretty
much straight there, but it was quite a bit of

246
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,479
travel on foot to get there.

247
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:43,960
TRAVIS: By a few days, I mean a couple weeks. I
think that's more of an appropriate estimation.

248
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:55,519
LAURA: So wait. If I sent a message from Alfield, then--
or, wait. Where were we when I sent that message?

249
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,744
SAM: You were in Alfield.

250
00:19:58,744 --> 00:20:04,999
LAURA: Then would it have got to Nicodranas and
to Zadash by now?

251
00:20:04,999 --> 00:20:09,125
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, Jester, that's got to take a while to get
there and back.

252
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,417
LIAM: It would take quite a while longer. I think
it's too early for you to have checked today.

253
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:15,007
MARISHA: We were in Alfield because that was also
when I stole the mail.

254
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:16,103
LAURA: Okay.

255
00:20:16,103 --> 00:20:21,584
LIAM: Also, sometimes people steal your mail. You
can get robbed on the road.

256
00:20:21,681 --> 00:20:23,820
MATT: No, I believe it was Trostenwald.

257
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:29,305
LAURA: No, I just had an itch-- you have a little
dirt on your face, but other than that.

258
00:20:29,305 --> 00:20:31,469
LIAM: Shit happens.

259
00:20:31,469 --> 00:20:37,185
LAURA: So maybe that's what it is, that's why.

260
00:20:37,185 --> 00:20:41,620
TRAVIS: Of course. Now, is she supposed to send you
stuff here?

261
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:46,442
LAURA: She was going to send it to The Pillow
Trove.

262
00:20:46,442 --> 00:20:49,325
TRAVIS: We'll have to hang out until it shows up,
then.

263
00:20:49,325 --> 00:20:50,617
LAURA: Yeah.

264
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:57,212
SAM: It seems like it's harder to get over to the
Pillow Trove, maybe you could have them forward

265
00:20:57,212 --> 00:20:59,713
your mail to here or something like that.

266
00:20:59,713 --> 00:21:10,169
LAURA: It would be a pretty expensive package, so
I feel like-- maybe I could do that.

267
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:13,350
SAM: Or if we had some sort of a P.O. box.

268
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:22,228
LAURA: I don't know what it is, but I'll look into
that. I have a room there tonight, you guys.

269
00:21:22,228 --> 00:21:26,086
MARISHA: Room party!

270
00:21:26,086 --> 00:21:31,207
LAURA: The thing is that apparently it's not easy
to get into that district.

271
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:34,287
LIAM: I was not able to accompany her to the
Pillow Trove.

272
00:21:34,287 --> 00:21:35,799
SAM and MARISHA: Why not?

273
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:37,679
LIAM: Because I am shabby.

274
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,155
TRAVIS: You're shabby?

275
00:21:40,155 --> 00:21:41,710
TALIESIN: That is fair, you are shabby.

276
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,915
LIAM: Shabbily dressed.

277
00:21:42,915 --> 00:21:43,825
LAURA: Shabby chic.

278
00:21:43,825 --> 00:21:45,293
SAM: We need to get you some nicer clothes, then.

279
00:21:45,293 --> 00:21:51,591
LIAM: You know, I was thinking on the walk back
here that I would probably like to get a cloak of

280
00:21:51,591 --> 00:21:52,770
some kind.

281
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:56,168
MARISHA: You could also get a new jacket and new
pants.

282
00:21:56,168 --> 00:22:02,045
LIAM: I know where everything is in every pocket
of this coat. It has been with me through a lot. What?

283
00:22:02,045 --> 00:22:07,597
LAURA: Maybe we can go somewhere and they will
make a coat exactly like that coat with all the

284
00:22:07,597 --> 00:22:10,409
same pockets, only it won't have the holes in it.

285
00:22:10,409 --> 00:22:15,132
MARISHA: How long could it take you to memorize
pockets on a coat? That's like 20 minutes.

286
00:22:15,132 --> 00:22:17,408
LIAM: I will probably just get a cloak.

287
00:22:17,408 --> 00:22:20,167
LAURA: Yeah, that's probably good too.

288
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:34,094
ASHLEY: Should we get you a rag as well? Just to
have on hand like a hanky. So you don't have to do

289
00:22:34,094 --> 00:22:36,462
a full bath, you could just do a quick--

290
00:22:36,462 --> 00:22:38,442
LIAM: I'm not bothered. It seems like maybe--

291
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:40,936
SAM and TALIESIN: I'm not bothered.

292
00:22:40,936 --> 00:22:42,832
ASHLEY: I'm definitely not bothered.

293
00:22:42,832 --> 00:22:48,950
TRAVIS: Yasha makes a good point, though. Just in
case a simple wipe-down was enough to gain you entry.

294
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,722
LIAM: You know, water is not very hard to come by,
so I can--

295
00:22:51,722 --> 00:23:01,932
LAURA: Or we just keep going to visit that guy who
made you clean. Every day we could go see him, and

296
00:23:01,932 --> 00:23:03,891
then he makes us all clean!

297
00:23:03,891 --> 00:23:05,934
MARISHA: You could really just get a new coat.

298
00:23:05,934 --> 00:23:09,337
TALIESIN: Does feel like a terrible abuse of
hospitality.

299
00:23:09,337 --> 00:23:16,829
LAURA: What, to use his power like that? I want to
ask The Traveler if he knows how to do that,

300
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:19,172
because I wonder if he could make me do that.

301
00:23:19,172 --> 00:23:22,738
TALIESIN: Is the Traveler the only god you've ever
seen, or have you seen other gods, out of curiosity?

302
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,522
LAURA: No, I've only seen that guy.

303
00:23:24,522 --> 00:23:27,463
TALIESIN: So this is the one that decided to make
itself presentable to you?

304
00:23:27,463 --> 00:23:28,699
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

305
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:32,193
MARISHA: She does see hamster unicorns. Are they
gods?

306
00:23:32,193 --> 00:23:35,893
LAURA: No, they're just unicorns.

307
00:23:35,893 --> 00:23:39,878
SAM: We've been sitting drinking, right?

308
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:41,530
TALIESIN: I've been drinking.

309
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,656
SAM: We've been plotting our next moves.

310
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:48,325
TRAVIS: We've got to tackle this job at some
point.

311
00:23:48,325 --> 00:23:52,591
LAURA: We've got to get to that sewer, you guys!

312
00:23:52,591 --> 00:23:58,925
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's a sewer nexus with a beast with
webs.

313
00:23:58,925 --> 00:24:01,066
MARISHA: So we're not having this room party?

314
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:03,070
TALIESIN: We're having the room party after the
sewers.

315
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:06,796
TRAVIS: Yeah, because we'll have bank and 
then we can get room service and shit.

316
00:24:06,866 --> 00:24:11,798
LAURA: But we'll have to get clean or else we
won't get in there.

317
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:13,637
TALIESIN: I want to defile a very expensive
shower.

318
00:24:13,637 --> 00:24:19,295
LIAM: That's what I'm saying, is the sewer first
because you are all going to be dirty like me.

319
00:24:19,295 --> 00:24:21,434
TALIESIN: And somebody else's hotel room will get
us clean.

320
00:24:21,434 --> 00:24:27,616
ASHLEY: If you're renting a room there, maybe they
have to let us in.

321
00:24:27,616 --> 00:24:30,400
MARISHA: You also have to get in in order to rent
the room.

322
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,041
LAURA: I think they only have to let me in,
technically.

323
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:35,712
TRAVIS: Did they give you a hall pass or
something?

324
00:24:35,712 --> 00:24:40,061
LAURA: I have this key. It says Pillow Trove on
it.

325
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:43,688
TRAVIS: Is it just a key or is there a thing that
dangles from it, something we could mimic and make

326
00:24:43,688 --> 00:24:45,101
more of?

327
00:24:45,101 --> 00:24:54,203
MATT: It's a very intricate key. It feels like a
dense iron, but it's been gold leafed, or coated

328
00:24:54,203 --> 00:25:00,397
in some sort of reflective gold-like metal. It's
very well made. It has little scrawlings on it,

329
00:25:00,397 --> 00:25:03,395
almost like a spiral in the center. The key
itself--

330
00:25:03,395 --> 00:25:07,093
TRAVIS: Jester, can I see it real fast?

331
00:25:07,093 --> 00:25:08,576
MATT: --is probably worth a silver in its own
right.

332
00:25:08,576 --> 00:25:09,943
LAURA: Oh yeah, Beau has it right now.

333
00:25:09,943 --> 00:25:13,905
TRAVIS: Oh. Thank you. I take a real good look at
it in case I want to fucking Minor Illusion that

334
00:25:13,905 --> 00:25:15,078
shit later.

335
00:25:15,078 --> 00:25:17,147
MATT: Okay. Good to know.

336
00:25:17,147 --> 00:25:24,491
LIAM: Also, I don't think that's the main issue.
They're very strict at the gate for who gets in,

337
00:25:24,491 --> 00:25:29,269
and some of us might not have a problem, but more
than one of us might.

338
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:33,765
MARISHA: Caleb, why are you so hung up on just
changing clothes for, like, ten minutes, just to

339
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:35,145
get through the door?

340
00:25:35,145 --> 00:25:37,231
LIAM: It seems more like you are hung up on it
than I am.

341
00:25:37,231 --> 00:25:40,513
TALIESIN: Let a man be eccentric.

342
00:25:40,513 --> 00:25:43,953
MARISHA: I'm just saying, you want in, dress for
what you want.

343
00:25:43,953 --> 00:25:45,701
LIAM: That's why I want to pay for a cloak.

344
00:25:45,701 --> 00:25:47,607
SAM: This is your jam?

345
00:25:47,607 --> 00:25:49,001
TALIESIN: I'm a real fan of this one.

346
00:25:49,001 --> 00:25:52,084
TRAVIS: It gets real turnt up when this here
starts playing.

347
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:57,451
MATT: You turn back at the three-piece half-elven
band that are moseying their way through the

348
00:25:57,451 --> 00:26:01,404
afternoon lazily. They're whispering and chatting
amongst each other and ribbing each other with

349
00:26:01,404 --> 00:26:05,265
their elbows between things, half-paying attention
to the music, but it's nice enough to keep atmosphere.

350
00:26:05,265 --> 00:26:07,258
TALIESIN: I'm tossing a silver over, just for
that.

351
00:26:07,258 --> 00:26:08,268
TRAVIS: A silver?!

352
00:26:08,268 --> 00:26:09,077
TALIESIN: Yeah.

353
00:26:09,077 --> 00:26:10,196
TRAVIS: Fucking start small, man.

354
00:26:10,196 --> 00:26:11,544
TALIESIN: Don't tell me how to spend my money.

355
00:26:11,544 --> 00:26:17,499
MATT: As the coin clinks and rolls about two feet
off, the gentleman standing with this double set

356
00:26:17,499 --> 00:26:21,673
of drums that lays over a leather strap on him--
you can see he's got the shaved sides of his

357
00:26:21,673 --> 00:26:26,003
head, this young half-elven boy-- immediately sees
that, stops drumming, grabs the coin, gives you a

358
00:26:26,003 --> 00:26:29,812
nod, and goes right back into the song. You watch
as the other performers all of a sudden

359
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,183
immediately look to you and they're all like--

360
00:26:32,183 --> 00:26:34,737
TRAVIS: Now the beat's all off.

361
00:26:34,737 --> 00:26:38,890
TALIESIN: What you're hearing is the happiness of
a performer.

362
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:43,157
LIAM: Are we going to--

363
00:26:43,157 --> 00:26:47,052
(laughter)

364
00:26:47,052 --> 00:26:48,865
MATT: So he's Steve Martin in The Jerk, yeah.

365
00:26:48,865 --> 00:26:51,267
(laughter)

366
00:26:51,267 --> 00:26:52,547
TALIESIN: Fuck you, Birdman.

367
00:26:52,547 --> 00:26:57,020
(laughter)

368
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:00,096
LIAM: Two things; one, Fjord, will you pass me
these cookies over here?

369
00:27:00,096 --> 00:27:01,162
TRAVIS: Yeah.

370
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:06,377
LIAM: Thank you. Second of all, are we going to
try to tackle this sewer this evening, or is this

371
00:27:06,377 --> 00:27:07,737
something that we're going to do tomorrow?

372
00:27:07,737 --> 00:27:08,954
SAM: What time is it?

373
00:27:08,954 --> 00:27:09,967
MATT: Later afternoon.

374
00:27:09,967 --> 00:27:13,195
TRAVIS: I've been looking at some of the folks
around here. I think they're over-exaggerating the

375
00:27:13,195 --> 00:27:15,005
importance of this beast.

376
00:27:15,005 --> 00:27:15,919
LIAM: Yeah?

377
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,203
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think we should at least go down
there and take a look.

378
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:23,066
LIAM: Oh, I'm not opposed to going down there, I
just mean are we waiting until cover of night or

379
00:27:23,066 --> 00:27:24,224
are we doing this--

380
00:27:24,224 --> 00:27:29,782
TRAVIS: Nah. I don't think so. I'm not a super fan
of the sewer during the day. I figure I'll like it

381
00:27:29,782 --> 00:27:31,154
even less at night.

382
00:27:31,154 --> 00:27:34,853
MARISHA: Well, why don't we at least go and talk
to that guard that came back? Try and track him

383
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:36,807
down, maybe get a little bit of insight.

384
00:27:36,807 --> 00:27:38,733
TRAVIS: Ooh, yeah. Do we know where that guy is?

385
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:40,616
MARISHA: Do we know where that guy is?

386
00:27:40,616 --> 00:27:41,757
MATT: Which guy?

387
00:27:41,757 --> 00:27:43,079
TRAVIS: The guy that came running back.

388
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:45,502
MARISHA: Oh, or was there a guy that came back?

389
00:27:45,502 --> 00:27:50,150
TRAVIS: That Voloshin said that one of them ran
back from the task.

390
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:55,353
MATT: Yeah, you don't know anything. You can go
back and try and ask for information on that, but

391
00:27:55,353 --> 00:27:57,940
you haven't met him or know anything.

392
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:02,050
TALIESIN: I know one thing that's a photosensitive
thing. If we need to make a fast escape I'd rather

393
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,999
have some light maybe, if it's something like
that.

394
00:28:03,999 --> 00:28:05,360
TRAVIS: Yeah.

395
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,534
TALIESIN: Daytime's better for that. Different
environment.

396
00:28:07,534 --> 00:28:08,791
TRAVIS: Good thinking.

397
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:11,311
LAURA: So is it better to go now or tomorrow
morning?

398
00:28:11,311 --> 00:28:12,365
TALIESIN: I don't know.

399
00:28:12,365 --> 00:28:13,732
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Now.

400
00:28:13,732 --> 00:28:17,476
TRAVIS: How long does it take to get over to the
Tri-Spire area, find us a manhole?

401
00:28:17,476 --> 00:28:23,801
MATT: From where you are now, it'd take you maybe
the better part of 45 minutes, better part of an hour.

402
00:28:23,801 --> 00:28:24,974
TRAVIS: Is it early afternoon or late afternoon?

403
00:28:24,974 --> 00:28:26,748
LAURA: Late afternoon, you said?

404
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:29,676
MATT: It's late afternoon. You're probably about
an hour and a half, two hours from sundown.

405
00:28:29,676 --> 00:28:32,562
TRAVIS: We'll be fine.

406
00:28:32,562 --> 00:28:33,640
TALIESIN: I say we do it.

407
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,493
TRAVIS: Yeah, why not?

408
00:28:34,493 --> 00:28:36,641
MARISHA: I mean, it will be dark after that.

409
00:28:36,641 --> 00:28:40,126
TALIESIN: I'm buzzed, and if I have another drink
I'm going to be more than buzzed.

410
00:28:40,126 --> 00:28:42,329
MARISHA: Oh yeah, let's drink and fight. That's a
good idea.

411
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:43,594
TRAVIS: We're definitely going now.

412
00:28:43,594 --> 00:28:45,985
TALIESIN: I'm right where I want to be. I want a
45-minute walk to get there.

413
00:28:45,985 --> 00:28:48,935
TRAVIS: Hey, let's do it. You'll walk your buzz
off.

414
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:54,406
MARISHA: Let's maybe stock up on some torches on
the way there. Nah, we don't need torches, do we?

415
00:28:54,406 --> 00:28:55,502
LIAM: No.

416
00:28:55,502 --> 00:28:56,502
MARISHA: Not anymore.

417
00:28:56,502 --> 00:28:57,897
LIAM: No.

418
00:28:57,897 --> 00:28:58,875
TRAVIS: Not with your nerd goggles.

419
00:28:58,875 --> 00:28:59,827
MARISHA: Yeah.

420
00:28:59,827 --> 00:29:04,185
MATT: Do keep in mind, and this is my fault too
for not keeping track of it, but even with

421
00:29:04,185 --> 00:29:09,275
darkvision, you're still seeing pretty low light.
Long-distance perception checks without light,

422
00:29:09,275 --> 00:29:13,206
you're still at disadvantage on them. I've been
bad about keeping track of that.

423
00:29:13,206 --> 00:29:14,733
LIAM: You've been bad.

424
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:16,741
TALIESIN: We have a light spell, though, don't
we?

425
00:29:16,741 --> 00:29:21,957
LIAM: Yeah, that's also dim light though as well.
It's not super bright. Unless I--

426
00:29:21,957 --> 00:29:24,302
TALIESIN: I must have a torch or something.

427
00:29:24,302 --> 00:29:26,039
MARISHA: I have one in my adventurer's kit.

428
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:28,376
LAURA: You have an adventurer's kit?

429
00:29:28,376 --> 00:29:29,328
MARISHA: Yeah.

430
00:29:29,328 --> 00:29:30,481
TALIESIN: I have a tinder box.

431
00:29:30,481 --> 00:29:34,101
MATT: So you can turn things into torches.

432
00:29:34,101 --> 00:29:35,814
TALIESIN: I have a hooded lantern.

433
00:29:35,814 --> 00:29:37,711
ASHLEY: I have a tinder box too. I have a torch!

434
00:29:37,711 --> 00:29:41,216
MATT: (laughs) Everyone looks at their equipment
suddenly!

435
00:29:41,216 --> 00:29:42,779
LIAM: This game is amazing!

436
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:45,009
TALIESIN: I have all this stuff in this bag I
never opened.

437
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:50,250
MATT: Well, all righty. What's the plan?

438
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:52,130
LAURA: Oh, I have an axe now!

439
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,980
MATT: You do. You have a handaxe.

440
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,305
TALIESIN: You've got a handaxe.

441
00:29:55,305 --> 00:29:56,167
LAURA: Yay!

442
00:29:56,167 --> 00:29:57,115
TALIESIN: Have you equipped it?

443
00:29:57,115 --> 00:29:57,885
LAURA: Yes.

444
00:29:57,885 --> 00:29:59,234
TALIESIN: Yeah, look at that. Oh, wow.

445
00:29:59,234 --> 00:30:04,596
TRAVIS: How about we casually make our way over,
and as we're doing that we can keep an eye out for

446
00:30:04,596 --> 00:30:07,397
kingsguard and see if they know of this guy?

447
00:30:07,397 --> 00:30:08,612
MARISHA: Copy.

448
00:30:08,612 --> 00:30:11,381
MATT: Are you guys making your way towards that
direction?

449
00:30:11,381 --> 00:30:13,000
LAURA: Yeah.

450
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,049
LIAM: I would like to keep my eye out for a decent
clothing shop.

451
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:23,983
MATT: Okay, fair enough. Make an investigation
check for you as you guys travel and traverse the city.

452
00:30:23,983 --> 00:30:30,728
LIAM: That is 11.

453
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:36,219
MATT: Yeah, along the way and keeping an eye out,
asking a couple questions here and there, you

454
00:30:36,219 --> 00:30:44,423
eventually find a very basic clothingwears
company. Nothing fancy, but just utility. Pants,

455
00:30:44,423 --> 00:30:50,647
worker's shirts, gloves, and cloaks are available.
So if you want to buy a cloak, you can do that.

456
00:30:50,647 --> 00:30:58,453
LIAM: I would like to get something that is brown,
muted, nothing gaudy. Probably don't have that anyway.

457
00:30:58,453 --> 00:31:04,171
MATT: Not in this one, no. Your choices are pretty
much brown, black, and gray, so you're good.

458
00:31:04,171 --> 00:31:06,102
LIAM: I'll take the brown one. Yeah.

459
00:31:06,102 --> 00:31:11,458
MATT: You're good on that one. I do not recall if
they had any pricing put down for cloaks.

460
00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:13,089
LIAM: It's 50 gold.

461
00:31:13,089 --> 00:31:20,990
MATT: 600 gold pieces, please. Eh, it falls under what
would be general common clothes, so I'll put the

462
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,560
cloak cost at two silver.

463
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,056
LIAM: Okay. I have that.

464
00:31:24,056 --> 00:31:30,280
TALIESIN: A poor man could buy half a cloak. Half
a cloak between them.

465
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,235
TRAVIS: One of those shitty dueling shawls that
they throw off?

466
00:31:33,235 --> 00:31:34,352
MATT: Exactly.

467
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:35,314
TALIESIN: I love it.

468
00:31:35,314 --> 00:31:39,897
SAM: Actually, what season is it? Are we north? Is
it going to get cold?

469
00:31:39,897 --> 00:31:41,012
LAURA: It's cold.

470
00:31:41,012 --> 00:31:46,196
MATT: The further north you go, yeah. This
particular area is pretty chilly, especially since

471
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,526
you're getting towards the end of fall. It's
almost Harvest Close in two weeks. You guys are

472
00:31:49,595 --> 00:31:56,046
hitting winter in the very near future.
You would know this, too, that snowfall is fairly

473
00:31:56,046 --> 00:31:58,660
common throughout the winter here.

474
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:02,030
SAM: Can you pick me up earmuffs?

475
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:10,919
LIAM: Of course I can do that. I ask for the
largest size they have and I get a woolen cap as well.

476
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:13,987
MATT: For both of those together? One silver piece.

477
00:32:13,987 --> 00:32:16,329
LIAM: Yeah, okay. I have that.

478
00:32:16,329 --> 00:32:20,124
ASHLEY: Are you going to take your ears and roll
them?

479
00:32:20,124 --> 00:32:24,556
SAM: That sounds amazing. I will do that.

480
00:32:24,556 --> 00:32:26,557
TRAVIS: Warren T. Rat in American Tail.

481
00:32:26,557 --> 00:32:28,274
MARISHA: Two sponge rollers.

482
00:32:28,274 --> 00:32:40,098
MATT: Perfect. Following that, the task board
contract that you recovered and was assigned to

483
00:32:40,098 --> 00:32:51,045
you by the Herald of the Hall contains both the
Writ of Lawmaster Intent, which is what will give

484
00:32:51,045 --> 00:32:56,598
you approval to travel into the sewer without
being harried by the Crownsguard, and also gives

485
00:32:56,598 --> 00:33:01,366
you the location of the sewer that leads you
there. Following the basic instructions and asking

486
00:33:01,366 --> 00:33:05,076
around, you eventually find yourselves at the
corner of Ruen Road and Dewmist.

487
00:33:05,076 --> 00:33:06,618
LIAM: Ruin?

488
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:14,086
MATT: Yeah. R-U-E-N. As you approach this
intersection, largely still cobblestone, a few

489
00:33:14,086 --> 00:33:21,096
that are missing and the dust has sift
pockets to make it soft. The sky is still light,

490
00:33:21,096 --> 00:33:27,257
but you can see the sun just beginning to crest past
the near walls, and familiar to the two of you, you

491
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:31,281
guys are maybe two blocks away from the outer wall of
the Tri-Spires.

492
00:33:31,281 --> 00:33:35,676
LAURA: Hey guys, we're about two blocks away from the
outer wall. We're super close.

493
00:33:35,676 --> 00:33:36,797
MARISHA: All right.

494
00:33:36,797 --> 00:33:39,646
MATT: At the intersection, there are two
crownsguard that are stationed there that are

495
00:33:39,646 --> 00:33:45,761
keeping eyes and watching around. Off to the
eastern side of that intersection, behind one of the

496
00:33:45,761 --> 00:33:55,151
poles that contain the lanterns that are lit at
night, you can see the cover that leads into the

497
00:33:55,151 --> 00:34:03,884
sewer below. It's less of a sewer or manhole
cover, but there's an open drain, and a latch and a

498
00:34:03,884 --> 00:34:06,637
small metal pole that prevents anyone from going
into it.

499
00:34:06,828 --> 00:34:08,496
LIAM: Are there any clowns in it?

500
00:34:08,496 --> 00:34:10,400
MATT: Make a perception check.

501
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:17,855
LIAM: That is a-- why I'm looking it up-- a ten.

502
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:21,424
MATT: "You don't see anything dangerous,
Georgie."

503
00:34:21,424 --> 00:34:23,460
TRAVIS: Oh, Jesus. Please no.

504
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:32,832
MATT: As you begin to spend time staring through
the grate and start deciding how to get into

505
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:36,766
there, one of the Crownsguard stationed walks up
and approaches quickly and goes, "Excuse me, can I

506
00:34:36,766 --> 00:34:38,848
"ask you what you're doing here?"

507
00:34:38,848 --> 00:34:40,551
MARISHA: Oh, good! They came to us.

508
00:34:40,642 --> 00:34:42,271
TRAVIS: Yeah, this is your opportunity to shine.
Get 'em.

509
00:34:42,271 --> 00:34:43,145
MARISHA: What?

510
00:34:43,145 --> 00:34:44,264
TRAVIS: Explain what we're doing.

511
00:34:44,264 --> 00:34:48,842
MARISHA: All right, here's what we're doing. We
got this whole writ thing from the Lawmaster. We're

512
00:34:48,842 --> 00:34:52,815
going to go down, kill the monster that's been
tormenting you guys. Heard you lost a few guards.

513
00:34:52,815 --> 00:34:56,311
Heard any rumors? Do you know anything, before we
go down there and maybe die?

514
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:59,334
MATT: "I've heard a few things. It's a--"

515
00:34:59,334 --> 00:35:00,417
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

516
00:35:00,417 --> 00:35:05,706
MATT: "Apparently there's something down there
that's been real scary and--"

517
00:35:05,706 --> 00:35:08,915
MARISHA: Come on, man.

518
00:35:08,915 --> 00:35:13,116
MATT: "I'm not fucking going down there. You
kidding me?"

519
00:35:13,116 --> 00:35:14,488
MARISHA: I'm not-- why--

520
00:35:14,488 --> 00:35:16,326
MATT: "I only know what I've heard!"

521
00:35:16,326 --> 00:35:20,764
MARISHA: Did I ever ask you to come with us? I
just asked for rumors, man.

522
00:35:20,764 --> 00:35:21,952
MATT: "No, I can open the grate."

523
00:35:21,952 --> 00:35:23,117
MARISHA: Don't put words in my mouth!

524
00:35:23,117 --> 00:35:24,400
MATT: "I wasn't meaning to put words in--"

525
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,161
MARISHA: Open the-- What did you hear?

526
00:35:26,161 --> 00:35:32,982
MATT: He scratches his head over his helmet and
doesn't realize he's not getting to the itch.

527
00:35:32,982 --> 00:35:36,960
MARISHA: Stop with the nervous tics. Stop.

528
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:45,848
MATT: "All I know is that apparently they lost a
couple of guys down there and--"

529
00:35:45,848 --> 00:35:47,068
MARISHA: I know that.

530
00:35:47,068 --> 00:35:48,625
MATT: "One of them was pissing himself and ran."

531
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:51,380
MARISHA: That's still not information on the
monster.

532
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:59,087
MATT: "Well, be my guest." He pulls a key off of a
ring and goes down to the latch on the metal bar

533
00:35:59,087 --> 00:36:01,437
that blocks off the entry and pulls it open.

534
00:36:01,437 --> 00:36:05,487
LAURA: What guard was it that ran away?

535
00:36:05,487 --> 00:36:07,695
MATT: "I don't fucking know! There's a lot of
them around here!"

536
00:36:07,695 --> 00:36:11,287
ASHLEY: Do you know how they were killed? Did
anybody see any wounds?

537
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:13,045
MATT: "They never recovered the body."

538
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:13,929
TRAVIS: Oh.

539
00:36:13,929 --> 00:36:15,166
ASHLEY: They never recovered the body.

540
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:17,264
LAURA: They're probably eaten completely by now.

541
00:36:17,264 --> 00:36:19,209
MATT: "Well, you're welcome to go down there and
continue."

542
00:36:19,209 --> 00:36:22,545
SAM: Are all the sewer grates blocked with a
lock?

543
00:36:22,545 --> 00:36:26,765
MATT: "Yes, to prevent folks from wandering into
them."

544
00:36:26,765 --> 00:36:28,766
LAURA: Oh no, but how will we get out?

545
00:36:28,766 --> 00:36:32,654
MATT: "Well, I'm stationed here for the next
several hours, so as long as you return--"

546
00:36:32,654 --> 00:36:35,254
SAM: To this one?

547
00:36:35,254 --> 00:36:36,555
MATT: "To this one. You'll be fine."

548
00:36:36,555 --> 00:36:39,374
LAURA: What if we get trapped at another one and
then we can't get out?

549
00:36:39,374 --> 00:36:44,253
MATT: "Well, start shouting. Keep that writ on hand
and if there's any crownsguard that hear you,

550
00:36:44,253 --> 00:36:45,893
"they'll probably be able to let you out."

551
00:36:45,893 --> 00:36:46,837
LAURA: Okay.

552
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:48,643
TRAVIS: Seems reasonable enough.

553
00:36:48,643 --> 00:36:53,345
MARISHA: Is there a way to navigate the sewer
systems? Any markings we should look out for?

554
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:59,692
MATT: "I'm going to be honest, I haven't been down
there. It smells real bad."

555
00:36:59,692 --> 00:37:04,651
TRAVIS: Do you know if the sewers flooded any time
during the day? Any sort of unexpected water flows?

556
00:37:04,651 --> 00:37:08,823
MATT: "I don't think so. We haven't had any heavy
rainfall. I haven't been able to hear more than a

557
00:37:08,823 --> 00:37:11,157
"trickle down there for a number of weeks."

558
00:37:11,157 --> 00:37:17,647
MARISHA: Nothing about what kind of monster it is?
No darkness? Tentacles? Big teeth?

559
00:37:17,647 --> 00:37:19,170
LIAM: Any sounds going on in there?

560
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,753
MATT: "Nothing I've heard, no."

561
00:37:21,753 --> 00:37:28,238
TRAVIS: When people ask you who were those brave souls
that ventured into sewer, you tell them The Mighty Nein.

562
00:37:28,238 --> 00:37:33,805
SAM and LAURA: (whistle and intone theme of The
Good, The Bad, and The Ugly)

563
00:37:33,805 --> 00:37:36,963
MATT: "I understand. There's seven of you."

564
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:40,204
SAM: Count again.

565
00:37:40,204 --> 00:37:43,549
LAURA: I move to the other side of Nott.

566
00:37:43,549 --> 00:37:45,661
LIAM: You have to think about it for a while.

567
00:37:45,661 --> 00:37:52,578
MATT: He looks genuinely overwhelmed by all the
information and goes, "Good luck, and yell if you

568
00:37:52,578 --> 00:37:58,973
"need something." (throat clearing) He pulls the
rest of the bar open and you guys have this space,

569
00:37:58,973 --> 00:38:00,335
about a foot and a half.

570
00:38:00,335 --> 00:38:01,811
TRAVIS: Who's first?

571
00:38:02,033 --> 00:38:02,975
ASHLEY: I go.

572
00:38:02,975 --> 00:38:06,091
TRAVIS: Yeah! Get in there, tank!

573
00:38:06,091 --> 00:38:13,584
MATT: Yasha, as you climb down, immediately it drops, 
and your foot finds a rung. There's a metallic bar that

574
00:38:13,584 --> 00:38:19,353
acts as a ladder. As you begin to lower yourself
down, you can look to your left and right, and

575
00:38:19,353 --> 00:38:23,477
what little bit of daylight is coming through
helps fill out some of the interior. You can

576
00:38:23,477 --> 00:38:30,885
see what looks to be maybe 15 or so feet across, from 
side to side, 15 to 20 feet from this wall to the other,

577
00:38:30,885 --> 00:38:36,808
slick stones, a slight curvature that leads
into a base where there is a small ditch or a

578
00:38:36,808 --> 00:38:42,054
basin where old liquid is trickling through. There
is a mild decline heading away from the direction

579
00:38:42,054 --> 00:38:50,762
you are and a mild incline heading in the
direction of the Tri-Spires. The smell is not

580
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:57,222
pleasant, but you're a tough chick, it's never
been an issue. So you get yourself down, and it's

581
00:38:57,222 --> 00:39:03,253
no more than ten feet to climb to the base of this
at the moment. You see from this spot where you've

582
00:39:03,253 --> 00:39:10,689
climbed down, the ceiling drops low to about
ten or so feet. You're probably about 15 or 20

583
00:39:10,761 --> 00:39:12,405
feet below the surface now.

584
00:39:12,405 --> 00:39:19,182
ASHLEY: I'll take out my torch. I'll light my
torch once I get down there.

585
00:39:19,182 --> 00:39:27,458
MATT: Your torch lights and the bright space
begins to open up from side to side.

586
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:31,257
LAURA: (yells) Do you see any monsters down
there?

587
00:39:31,257 --> 00:39:34,908
ASHLEY: I look around. (yells back) Everything
looks good!

588
00:39:34,908 --> 00:39:36,259
MATT: Make a perception check.

589
00:39:36,259 --> 00:39:37,202
ASHLEY: Oh.

590
00:39:37,202 --> 00:39:39,102
(laughter)

591
00:39:39,102 --> 00:39:40,202
MATT: Spoke too soon.

592
00:39:40,202 --> 00:39:47,346
ASHLEY: I forgot how to play D&D! Everything looks
good! (screams) Uh-oh!

593
00:39:47,346 --> 00:39:50,588
LIAM: The boulder from Raiders.

594
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:53,399
TRAVIS: Yasha?

595
00:39:53,399 --> 00:39:58,103
ASHLEY: Eight! Like I said, everything looks good!

596
00:39:58,103 --> 00:40:06,911
LIAM: Do you want Nott down there? It's what you
do. You're very good.

597
00:40:06,911 --> 00:40:08,764
ASHLEY: Yeah, come on down, Nott.

598
00:40:08,764 --> 00:40:13,143
SAM: Before I go, can I borrow that ring of water
walking?

599
00:40:13,143 --> 00:40:17,547
LAURA: Oh, sure. Wait, which one was it?

600
00:40:17,547 --> 00:40:21,324
SAM: Not that one, that one, or that one. I know
what those are.

601
00:40:21,374 --> 00:40:22,264
LAURA: What about this one?

602
00:40:22,264 --> 00:40:23,535
SAM: Yeah. That's it.

603
00:40:23,535 --> 00:40:25,365
(laughter)

604
00:40:25,365 --> 00:40:27,826
SAM: I don't know if you have to attune to it, but
I'm going.

605
00:40:27,826 --> 00:40:28,780
LAURA: You don't.

606
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:29,946
MATT: Yeah, you don't have to.

607
00:40:29,946 --> 00:40:31,587
SAM: All right, I'll go down there with Yasha.

608
00:40:31,587 --> 00:40:38,025
MATT. You climb down and join Yasha there. You can
see the slight decline behind you as it progresses

609
00:40:38,025 --> 00:40:47,051
away from the direction of where this current seems to
have happened. Once again, the smell is stagnant,

610
00:40:47,127 --> 00:40:56,339
a combination of waste product and whatever else
has rotted and congealed down there. That smell of

611
00:40:56,339 --> 00:41:02,933
bacteria-filled liquid and water. Continuing
upward, it curves a little bit to the right and

612
00:41:02,933 --> 00:41:08,577
out of sight with a faint bit of torchlight that
bounces off the slick wall. There is a weird humid

613
00:41:08,577 --> 00:41:16,910
warmness to the air down here. It's not extremely
pleasant. You don't see anything else in here other than

614
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:24,538
what look to be clusters of waste combined with
sticks and whatever else has washed down here

615
00:41:24,624 --> 00:41:29,562
through previous storms and has begun to build up
blockages here and there, maybe a foot, two feet across.

616
00:41:29,562 --> 00:41:33,349
SAM: Are we going to keep going? Or should we get
the--

617
00:41:33,349 --> 00:41:34,941
ASHLEY: We can wait until everybody gets down.

618
00:41:34,941 --> 00:41:36,017
LAURA: Can we come down?

619
00:41:36,017 --> 00:41:37,155
SAM: It's fine! Just come down.

620
00:41:37,155 --> 00:41:38,136
TALIESIN: Coming down.

621
00:41:38,136 --> 00:41:41,634
ASHLEY: I keep looking. Keeping watch. Listening.

622
00:41:41,634 --> 00:41:47,509
MATT: You all eventually down into the sewer
grate and then you hear the (metal scraping) (click) and

623
00:41:47,586 --> 00:41:49,337
the metal bar up top is closed.

624
00:41:49,337 --> 00:41:50,802
LAURA: He locked us in!

625
00:41:50,802 --> 00:41:52,176
TRAVIS: No, he just closed it, Jester.

626
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,838
SAM: It's a trap, we're all going to die.

627
00:41:54,838 --> 00:41:56,670
ASHLEY: We won't die.

628
00:41:56,670 --> 00:42:07,531
TRAVIS: What do we think? Go up or down? Up,
right?

629
00:42:07,531 --> 00:42:10,278
LAURA: I think a monster would be down.

630
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,615
SAM: Monsters are down.

631
00:42:12,615 --> 00:42:19,738
MARISHA: Can I do a look around to see if there
are any types of street marking for the sewers?

632
00:42:19,738 --> 00:42:21,879
MATT: Make an investigation check.

633
00:42:21,879 --> 00:42:24,541
TRAVIS: I put the glove of blasting on my left
hand.

634
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:28,813
MARISHA: Natural 18. 22, I believe. 22.

635
00:42:28,813 --> 00:42:38,737
MATT: Looking at right near the base of where the
rungs are, it looks like there are arrows that point each

636
00:42:38,737 --> 00:42:46,372
direction. The arrow to the right, which leads
upward, splits into three additional arrows.

637
00:42:46,372 --> 00:42:53,325
MARISHA: So one, two, three type of a thing. What
about the arrow to the left?

638
00:42:53,325 --> 00:42:55,399
MATT: It's just a continuous arrow.

639
00:42:55,399 --> 00:42:57,477
TRAVIS: What the fuck did you just draw?

640
00:42:57,477 --> 00:43:03,119
MARISHA: This arrow splits into three arrows and
then-- and it's a penis.

641
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:07,435
TRAVIS: If you ever make a road sign, people are
fucked. That is--

642
00:43:07,435 --> 00:43:09,299
LIAM: That's a Nintendo controller.

643
00:43:09,299 --> 00:43:13,098
TRAVIS: Yep. That's some old fucking Street
Fighter combo shit.

644
00:43:13,098 --> 00:43:15,420
TALIESIN: Up, up, down, down, left, right, left,
right.

645
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:20,365
MARISHA: Right, yeah. Also, there's got to be an A
and B around here. All right, I guess there are

646
00:43:20,365 --> 00:43:23,378
more options this way or down deeper.

647
00:43:23,378 --> 00:43:24,601
TALIESIN: South.

648
00:43:24,601 --> 00:43:26,470
MARISHA: I mean, it is a sewer system.

649
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,875
TRAVIS: You really want to go south? You two?

650
00:43:27,875 --> 00:43:28,963
TALIESIN: Always down.

651
00:43:28,963 --> 00:43:30,601
ASHLEY: Well, I feel like if you were a monster,
you would go--

652
00:43:30,601 --> 00:43:32,425
LIAM: Go further away from people.

653
00:43:32,425 --> 00:43:34,949
TRAVIS: I like that logic.

654
00:43:34,949 --> 00:43:40,169
MARISHA: Or it could just be the main drainage out
of the city.

655
00:43:40,169 --> 00:43:41,366
TALIESIN: That's fair.

656
00:43:41,366 --> 00:43:46,509
TRAVIS: Bobby Tarantino territory. Let's do it. Let's go
south.

657
00:43:46,509 --> 00:43:48,027
MARISHA: All right.

658
00:43:48,027 --> 00:43:54,697
LAURA: I feel like we're walking in a stinky
crotch. Why?!

659
00:43:54,697 --> 00:43:58,651
TRAVIS: Asshole.

660
00:43:58,651 --> 00:44:02,100
(laughter)

661
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,116
LAURA: The Traveler!

662
00:44:04,116 --> 00:44:08,638
LIAM and ASHLEY: No!

663
00:44:08,638 --> 00:44:13,734
LIAM: Everything's going to be fine, Jester.

664
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:23,266
MATT: Shh. Don't spoil it! You guys begin to head
southward. It's a very faint decline. You can

665
00:44:23,266 --> 00:44:27,453
only tell it's a decline in the sense that if you
look right or left you can see the water is

666
00:44:27,453 --> 00:44:35,476
trickling in the direction you're traveling. The
tunnel continues for about 100 feet or so before it

667
00:44:35,476 --> 00:44:44,713
curves slightly to the right and then comes to another
set of rungs and another sewer-top access.

668
00:44:44,713 --> 00:44:47,060
LIAM: Were we told that there was some sort of
webbing?

669
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:52,084
MATT: Yes, that was the only notable element of
what you were looking for.

670
00:44:52,084 --> 00:44:53,567
LIAM: I see. Any of that as we go?

671
00:44:53,567 --> 00:44:55,063
MATT: Perception check.

672
00:44:55,063 --> 00:44:57,027
MARISHA: I wrote down blockage, webbing, and
nest.

673
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,971
LIAM: 19.

674
00:44:58,971 --> 00:45:01,323
MATT: No sense of webbing, no.

675
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:04,035
LAURA: Do we see any rats down here?

676
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:08,169
MATT: At the moment, you don't see anything moving,
no.

677
00:45:08,169 --> 00:45:09,782
ASHLEY: Any tracks of any sort?

678
00:45:09,782 --> 00:45:13,057
MATT: Make an investigation check if you want to.

679
00:45:13,057 --> 00:45:16,006
ASHLEY: 13.

680
00:45:16,006 --> 00:45:26,199
MATT: You get down and look about, and you don't
see any tracks by any means, but you notice that

681
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:33,682
near where the water is-- and it's a faint trickle
of water. The stream is about that wide, and you

682
00:45:33,682 --> 00:45:41,752
barely hear it moving past. You see elements of
sludge that has slowly congealed over time along

683
00:45:41,752 --> 00:45:49,094
the edges of this groove that guides the liquid,
and you can see bits are pushed like something had

684
00:45:49,094 --> 00:45:57,160
moved through in the direction of where you were,
but that's it.

685
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,944
LAURA: In the direction of where we came from?

686
00:45:59,944 --> 00:46:05,032
MATT: Angled like something slid and pushed
through the water in the direction you came from.

687
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:09,105
MARISHA: How big are those slide marks, Yasha?

688
00:46:09,105 --> 00:46:10,998
MATT: About four inches.

689
00:46:10,998 --> 00:46:12,540
MARISHA: Four inches?

690
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:16,338
MATT: Yeah. You see one or two that slide out.

691
00:46:16,338 --> 00:46:20,589
LAURA: Does that mean we're going the wrong way or
the right way?

692
00:46:20,589 --> 00:46:25,028
SAM: I'm going to get down and take a little bit
of the smear and--

693
00:46:25,028 --> 00:46:26,174
LAURA: Ew!

694
00:46:26,174 --> 00:46:28,043
SAM: Do I taste anything?

695
00:46:28,043 --> 00:46:30,145
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

696
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:35,356
SAM: 19. Plus five! No, plus three.

697
00:46:35,356 --> 00:46:42,708
MATT: It's a combination of things. Your
alchemical history and heightened goblin senses

698
00:46:42,708 --> 00:46:50,658
for waste product. There's hints of excrement.

699
00:46:50,658 --> 00:46:53,809
LIAM: Know how much diarrhea blasting they did in
the Middle Ages?

700
00:46:53,809 --> 00:46:55,986
(groaning)

701
00:46:55,986 --> 00:46:59,642
MATT: No! No! No!

702
00:47:01,002 --> 00:47:03,002
No. All right. Um--

703
00:47:03,002 --> 00:47:05,179
SAM: It's old diarrhea.

704
00:47:05,276 --> 00:47:08,081
MATT: Stop it, Sam! Okay.

705
00:47:08,081 --> 00:47:09,637
TALIESIN: This is your fault.

706
00:47:09,638 --> 00:47:11,471
MARISHA: There are people eating 
at home right now.

707
00:47:11,569 --> 00:47:20,184
MATT: There's a hint of an iron aftertaste,
something oxidizing somewhere in the water, or the

708
00:47:20,184 --> 00:47:28,210
water itself. A faint hint of sulphur from the
water and things breaking down in the water.

709
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:39,130
Nothing that catches your immediate attention
except for -- Oh my God, she's no longer

710
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:41,211
roleplaying!

711
00:47:41,589 --> 00:47:44,594
LAURA: Oh my God! I didn't even put it together.

712
00:47:44,594 --> 00:47:47,445
LIAM: That's all that's in the haversack.

713
00:47:47,445 --> 00:47:49,784
LAURA: I just want this.

714
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:58,905
MATT: Because you rolled so high, that faint iron
aftertaste is familiar.

715
00:47:58,905 --> 00:48:00,349
SAM: Familiar?

716
00:48:00,349 --> 00:48:01,595
LAURA: Is it blood?

717
00:48:01,595 --> 00:48:06,202
MATT: It reminds you of when you've licked a wound
or bit your lip. It's very faint. Because you

718
00:48:06,202 --> 00:48:09,878
rolled that high, you're like, hmm.

719
00:48:09,878 --> 00:48:13,601
SAM: This is bloody stool.

720
00:48:13,601 --> 00:48:17,738
(groaning)

721
00:48:17,738 --> 00:48:20,679
TALIESIN: How would you know that?

722
00:48:20,679 --> 00:48:26,215
SAM: I know this taste. I know it well.

723
00:48:26,215 --> 00:48:32,579
TRAVIS: Nobody is going to ask you why you know
that. Just so we're clear, you don't need to

724
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:34,766
explain anymore.

725
00:48:34,766 --> 00:48:38,414
SAM: It's sort of like Pringles, where you just
can't have one.

726
00:48:38,414 --> 00:48:41,515
LAURA: I might throw up.

727
00:48:41,515 --> 00:48:43,708
MATT: So what are you guys doing?

728
00:48:43,708 --> 00:48:45,749
SAM: So something's been killed and dragged that
way.

729
00:48:45,749 --> 00:48:48,320
TRAVIS: I think maybe we should head back in the
opposite direction.

730
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:58,193
ASHLEY: In the area where we're at, the only exit
now goes up another rung to the outside?

731
00:48:58,193 --> 00:49:05,365
MATT: Correct. Or continues on the direction you
were traveling. Looking at that set of rungs, you

732
00:49:05,365 --> 00:49:08,432
can see the arrows that are still marked there.
There's a singular arrow that goes in the

733
00:49:08,432 --> 00:49:12,179
direction where you came from, and the other arrow
splits into two. You get the sense that each of

734
00:49:12,179 --> 00:49:18,705
these indicates where the next, if you continue
that way, if it's going to divide or be straight.

735
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:22,679
Part of this network of sewers that have been
built below Zadash long ago.

736
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:27,612
TRAVIS: Since you're tasting hemorrhoids in the
water, it's probably coming from that direction.

737
00:49:27,612 --> 00:49:30,374
LAURA: Yeah, you're right.

738
00:49:30,374 --> 00:49:36,334
MARISHA: The water seems to be moving towards the
direction we're going?

739
00:49:36,334 --> 00:49:40,934
MATT: You were heading down, and the water's
trickling in that direction.

740
00:49:40,934 --> 00:49:42,895
MARISHA: Go back the other way.

741
00:49:42,895 --> 00:49:44,960
LAURA: We turn around.

742
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,170
TRAVIS: Let's do it.

743
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:53,968
MATT: You guys continue back to where you were and
traverse instead upwards. You guys had paid a

744
00:49:53,968 --> 00:49:58,359
little bit of attention when you were traveling
towards the Tri-Spire, but the entire city is not

745
00:49:58,359 --> 00:50:03,892
level. There are grades to it. It was built over
hilly terrain, as most of this valley itself has

746
00:50:03,892 --> 00:50:12,678
all sorts of varying heights of hills and clusters
of hills. The Tri-Spire is up on a raised hill

747
00:50:12,678 --> 00:50:18,579
within the city's construct, so as you ascend in
the direction of the Tri-Spire, you get the sense

748
00:50:18,579 --> 00:50:24,548
that you're not ascending too terribly much, but
you're now just about underneath where the wall

749
00:50:24,548 --> 00:50:32,952
was. As it curves around a bit, you look ahead as
Yasha's holding out her torch, and you can see a

750
00:50:32,952 --> 00:50:40,393
T-intersection of the sewer where it continues on
straight, or heads to the right, or to the left.

751
00:50:40,393 --> 00:50:43,441
LAURA: You should probably lick the ground
everywhere and see if you taste that blood

752
00:50:43,441 --> 00:50:44,376
anymore.

753
00:50:44,376 --> 00:50:51,679
MATT: You also see more of those clusters of
built-up refuse that have created small masses in

754
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:54,782
the ground where the water is pooling and making
its way around.

755
00:50:54,782 --> 00:50:55,914
LIAM: Blockages.

756
00:50:55,914 --> 00:50:56,854
MATT: Yeah.

757
00:50:56,854 --> 00:50:59,843
TRAVIS: The curved surface of this area, can we
see the ceiling clearly or is it way above us?

758
00:50:59,843 --> 00:51:04,964
MATT: You can, yeah. And while the floor itself--
the walls gradually come in and become a bit of a

759
00:51:04,964 --> 00:51:10,263
level platform and then descend into the ditch
where the water is traversing, the ceiling is a

760
00:51:10,263 --> 00:51:12,931
continued curvature of it. It's almost like a
tube.

761
00:51:12,931 --> 00:51:14,377
LAURA: Any webbing?

762
00:51:14,377 --> 00:51:15,959
MATT: Make a perception check.

763
00:51:15,959 --> 00:51:17,831
SAM: I'm going to look for footprints.

764
00:51:17,831 --> 00:51:19,226
MATT: You make an investigation check.

765
00:51:19,226 --> 00:51:20,622
LAURA: Perception?

766
00:51:20,622 --> 00:51:22,018
SAM: That's a one.

767
00:51:22,018 --> 00:51:23,808
LAURA: 21.

768
00:51:24,702 --> 00:51:38,553
MATT: You see a very faint, barely shifting piece
of thin silk cheese cloth-like material that is

769
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:44,348
barely visible on the cusp of the torchlight on
the right-hand side of that intersection.

770
00:51:44,348 --> 00:51:48,385
LAURA: Guys, guys, look, look! Bring the torch
over!

771
00:51:48,385 --> 00:51:49,762
TRAVIS: Dust?

772
00:51:49,762 --> 00:51:51,973
LAURA: It's a webbing!

773
00:51:51,973 --> 00:51:57,272
MATT: As we continue from this point, guys, I want
to know what your marching order is as you're

774
00:51:57,272 --> 00:51:58,590
traversing forward.

775
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:00,102
LIAM: Hey, I'm at the back.

776
00:52:00,102 --> 00:52:02,308
MATT: Right. We have Caleb at the back.

777
00:52:02,523 --> 00:52:05,151
LAURA: Maybe that would be bad, though. Maybe you
should be in the middle. Have you ever been at a

778
00:52:05,151 --> 00:52:07,878
haunted house? They come at you from behind!

779
00:52:07,878 --> 00:52:13,035
MARISHA: That's true, the middle is the safest.
I'll take the front with Yasha, I'm assuming.

780
00:52:13,035 --> 00:52:14,591
SAM: I'll be right behind them.

781
00:52:14,591 --> 00:52:16,490
TALIESIN: I'll be with you.

782
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:19,000
TRAVIS: Yeah. Swords in the middle.

783
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,865
MATT: Nott, you're in the middle with them?

784
00:52:21,865 --> 00:52:23,738
SAM: Middle-rear.

785
00:52:23,738 --> 00:52:26,305
MATT: Jester, where are you?

786
00:52:26,305 --> 00:52:28,291
LAURA: I guess I'll be right behind Molly.

787
00:52:28,291 --> 00:52:33,928
MATT: There we go. So you go up and inspect the
web?

788
00:52:33,928 --> 00:52:34,878
LAURA: Yeah!

789
00:52:34,878 --> 00:52:40,265
MATT: You guys head up with the torch. You come
into the intersection. The water is coming down

790
00:52:40,265 --> 00:52:49,016
from the path in front of you, directly across.
The left-hand tunnel continues for about 40 or 50

791
00:52:49,016 --> 00:52:53,493
feet before it curves off and goes upward again,
almost a parallel path. There's water trickling

792
00:52:53,493 --> 00:52:59,504
down there that's all meeting here. To the right,
where this webbing is, there is no water. It is a

793
00:52:59,504 --> 00:53:01,396
dry ditch.

794
00:53:01,396 --> 00:53:05,310
LAURA: I bet that's where we need to go. It's
blocked.

795
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:09,973
ASHLEY: Can I touch a little bit of the webbing
with the flame?

796
00:53:09,973 --> 00:53:17,393
MATT: Sure. You bring the torch to the webbing and
watch as it burns away in a few seconds and turns

797
00:53:17,393 --> 00:53:30,224
to ash and dust. There's also a very faint
scratching sound.

798
00:53:30,224 --> 00:53:35,307
TALIESIN: I'm activating one. I'm pulling a hand
down one of my swords and I'm getting it to light up.

799
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:38,747
MATT: You activate one of them. As it lights up,
you bring the torch around to look.

800
00:53:38,747 --> 00:53:40,807
MARISHA: Putting my goggles on.

801
00:53:40,807 --> 00:53:45,602
TRAVIS: I'm going to go ahead and cast Armor of
Agathys, get on the spectral frost armor.

802
00:53:45,602 --> 00:53:54,389
MATT: As the armor filters up onto you, the weird,
warm, humid air of the sewer interior seems to

803
00:53:54,389 --> 00:53:59,968
crystallize against your armor. The ice that
normally gives a translucent bluish-white color

804
00:53:59,968 --> 00:54:02,460
has a strangely yellow-green tint to it.

805
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:04,642
MARISHA: Poop-mist!

806
00:54:07,232 --> 00:54:08,956
TRAVIS: It's the snowcone variety.

807
00:54:10,626 --> 00:54:13,883
SAM: As I see everybody doing this, I'm going to
take a big swig of liquor.

808
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:19,855
MATT: Okay. You take a quick swig. You guys look
out in the distant tunnels and you see nothing.

809
00:54:19,855 --> 00:54:23,225
TRAVIS: Scratching sound's a rat and we're all
like (whimper).

810
00:54:23,225 --> 00:54:26,258
MARISHA: (squeaking)

811
00:54:26,258 --> 00:54:31,204
MATT: It's funny. As you glance down at the
ground, though, one of those small clusters of

812
00:54:31,204 --> 00:54:38,209
refuse shifts a little bit. And shifts again.

813
00:54:38,209 --> 00:54:39,988
LAURA: (whispering) What is it?

814
00:54:39,988 --> 00:54:42,693
MARISHA: I take a ball bearing--

815
00:54:42,778 --> 00:54:45,103
LAURA: Poke it with your stick!

816
00:54:45,103 --> 00:54:50,457
MATT: I say little. It's a few feet across.
They've gotten larger as you've progressed on.

817
00:54:50,457 --> 00:54:53,513
MARISHA: I'm going to take a ball bearing and ping
it.

818
00:54:53,513 --> 00:54:55,758
LAURA: How close is it to us?

819
00:54:55,758 --> 00:55:00,854
MATT: There's a bunch up in the hall around you
right now. As you throw the ball bearing and it

820
00:55:00,854 --> 00:55:09,349
hits, some of it breaks away, and you see horrible
matted fur. There's a flash in the torchlight

821
00:55:09,349 --> 00:55:15,811
where you see two eyes reflect through, and you
hear this sound (shriek). You watch as fangs open

822
00:55:15,811 --> 00:55:23,047
up, and a bunch of the other clusters of gathered
refuse all suddenly begin to shift and skitter in

823
00:55:23,047 --> 00:55:25,008
your direction. I need you all to roll
initiative.

824
00:55:25,035 --> 00:55:26,691
ALL: (exclaiming)

825
00:55:26,691 --> 00:55:28,075
LAURA: We're fighting poop-rats!

826
00:55:29,835 --> 00:55:31,175
MARISHA: It's a hairball.

827
00:55:33,459 --> 00:55:35,389
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

828
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:41,220
LAURA: That's what happens when I roll
one that I haven't been charging up.

829
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:43,777
SAM: Yep, yep. It's definitely because of that.

830
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:52,076
Look at this sewer! Is that real wet?

831
00:55:52,076 --> 00:55:53,687
LAURA: It just looks wet.

832
00:55:53,687 --> 00:55:55,147
MARISHA: It's like resin.

833
00:55:55,147 --> 00:55:57,447
MATT: We had you guys up here.

834
00:55:57,447 --> 00:55:58,700
TRAVIS: It's actual shit.

835
00:56:00,755 --> 00:56:03,323
LAURA: Matt is very committed.

836
00:56:03,323 --> 00:56:08,115
MARISHA: It's reality seeping into our game a
little bit.

837
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:10,114
MATT: All righty.

838
00:56:10,114 --> 00:56:15,449
LAURA: Oh no! See, Caleb, look, you should've been
in the middle of us!

839
00:56:15,449 --> 00:56:23,451
MATT: All of these sewer-faring giant rats begin
to rush towards you. Their fur seems to have, over

840
00:56:23,451 --> 00:56:33,743
time, merged with other bits of discarded debris
and matter, causing this outer shell of broken

841
00:56:33,743 --> 00:56:42,083
garbage, trash, and excrement that protects them
and gives this look of a horrible, half-burned

842
00:56:42,083 --> 00:56:49,671
pile of compost with teeth and fur rushing in your
direction. On that note.

843
00:56:54,593 --> 00:56:57,100
ASHLEY: I love that we're fighting rats right
now.

844
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:00,092
MARISHA: I know! It's so Baldur's Gate. I love
it.

845
00:57:00,092 --> 00:57:02,703
LAURA: (chanting) Level three!

846
00:57:06,263 --> 00:57:10,989
MATT: For initiative here, guys, let's start with
25 to 20. Anyone?

847
00:57:11,164 --> 00:57:12,562
LAURA: Oh shit, really?

848
00:57:12,562 --> 00:57:13,495
MATT: Oh damn.

849
00:57:13,495 --> 00:57:14,144
SAM: 20.

850
00:57:14,144 --> 00:57:15,674
TRAVIS: 20 as well. Natural 20.

851
00:57:15,946 --> 00:57:20,431
MATT: You rolled a natural 20? What's your
initiative?

852
00:57:20,431 --> 00:57:21,520
TRAVIS: Zero.

853
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:27,839
MATT: Oh, that's right. We have Nott and Fjord. 20
to 15?

854
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:28,999
ASHLEY: 17.

855
00:57:28,999 --> 00:57:30,047
MARISHA: 19.

856
00:57:30,047 --> 00:57:32,350
TRAVIS: I'm a limited fucking warlock.

857
00:57:32,350 --> 00:57:35,213
MARISHA: (chanting) Level three!

858
00:57:35,213 --> 00:57:36,896
MATT: 15 to 10.

859
00:57:37,906 --> 00:57:38,881
ASHLEY: Oh shit.

860
00:57:38,881 --> 00:57:41,070
MATT: 10 to five.

861
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:42,327
LAURA: Eight.

862
00:57:42,327 --> 00:57:43,553
TALIESIN: Six.

863
00:57:43,553 --> 00:57:46,040
ASHLEY: No, I know. I'm one to talk.

864
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,761
LAURA: No, mine was nine!

865
00:57:47,761 --> 00:57:49,355
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Nine!

866
00:57:49,355 --> 00:57:50,386
MATT: Molly, what was yours?

867
00:57:50,386 --> 00:57:51,601
TALIESIN: Six.

868
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:54,059
MATT: All righty.

869
00:57:54,059 --> 00:57:55,715
LIAM: Vier.

870
00:57:55,715 --> 00:57:57,749
LAURA: It might've been eight. Let's just make it
eight because I can't remember if I rolled a five

871
00:57:57,749 --> 00:57:59,142
or a six.

872
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:07,755
MATT: It's fine. It doesn't matter in the order.
At the top, all of them start rushing in, their

873
00:58:07,755 --> 00:58:15,988
eyes glaring as they shift past the torch that
Yasha's holding. There's probably six, maybe seven

874
00:58:15,988 --> 00:58:20,426
in the vicinity at a quick glance around you, and
they're all rushing in your direction. Nott and

875
00:58:20,426 --> 00:58:22,103
Fjord, you guys are up first.

876
00:58:22,103 --> 00:58:27,604
TRAVIS: I turn to see where all of them are in
relation to the party. Are there any sons of

877
00:58:27,604 --> 00:58:29,853
bitches over here that I can't see?

878
00:58:29,853 --> 00:58:31,375
MATT: At the moment, you don't see any.

879
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:36,012
TRAVIS: Okay, great. I turn around and I see Caleb
being flanked by two of them, and I know he is

880
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:40,622
super squishy. Can I run towards this rat?

881
00:58:40,622 --> 00:58:42,370
MATT: You can.

882
00:58:42,370 --> 00:58:44,904
TRAVIS: Can I reach back with my hand and--

883
00:58:44,904 --> 00:58:49,864
MATT: That rat there gets an attack of opportunity
as you swipe out of its range first. That is going

884
00:58:49,864 --> 00:58:53,515
to be a 15, actually, not bad.

885
00:58:53,515 --> 00:58:54,462
TRAVIS: That hits.

886
00:58:54,462 --> 00:58:55,645
MATT: That hits!

887
00:58:55,645 --> 00:58:57,813
LAURA: You just got bit by a rat,
running away.

888
00:58:57,998 --> 00:59:02,269
MATT: As it snaps out at you, you take
five points of piercing damage. As it bites out,

889
00:59:02,269 --> 00:59:07,911
you feel its teeth sink into the back of your calf
muscle, through the armor and into the back of the

890
00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:12,090
thick running muscle. The pain strikes through
you. You yank your foot away and you feel

891
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:16,274
something tear. You can feel the blood running
down the back of your leg and inside your boot as

892
00:59:16,274 --> 00:59:22,030
you feel the pounding of the very dirty bite that
it's left in the back of your leg.

893
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:26,287
TRAVIS: The rat takes ten points of frost damage.

894
00:59:26,287 --> 00:59:34,099
MATT: As you pull away from it, the pounding pain
of your leg is also accompanied by the sudden

895
00:59:34,099 --> 00:59:42,980
sound of a rat shattering into ice pieces against
the ground and disintegrating. As it bites and

896
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:48,341
sinks its teeth into you, the thing suddenly
crusts over with a similar type of strange,

897
00:59:48,341 --> 00:59:53,838
yellowish-green ice before it T-1000 shatters
across the floor of the inside of the sewer.

898
00:59:53,838 --> 00:59:55,646
Continuing your round.

899
00:59:55,646 --> 01:00:00,242
TRAVIS: I reach back to strike the rat. As my hand
comes down, I'll summon the falchion into my hand

900
01:00:00,242 --> 01:00:01,564
and strike down.

901
01:00:01,656 --> 01:00:09,624
MATT: In one sweep, an empty hand apparates, and
water springs out from the grasp as it slams down.

902
01:00:09,624 --> 01:00:11,401
Go ahead and roll for an attack.

903
01:00:11,401 --> 01:00:13,239
LAURA: Is it also yellow water?

904
01:00:13,239 --> 01:00:14,621
MATT and TRAVIS: No.

905
01:00:14,621 --> 01:00:15,683
TRAVIS: It's a 14.

906
01:00:15,683 --> 01:00:17,672
MATT: A 14 hits. You can roll damage.

907
01:00:17,672 --> 01:00:19,782
TRAVIS: It was one-handed, so 1d8.

908
01:00:23,472 --> 01:00:25,789
Ten points of damage.

909
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:31,884
MATT: As you sweep down, you completely bisect the
rat with your blade. It screams out in this loud,

910
01:00:31,884 --> 01:00:36,414
heavy, horrible, monstrous squeak. You're not used
to hearing what normally is a small rodent sound,

911
01:00:36,414 --> 01:00:42,484
but amplified from a larger, bulbous, mutated form
that it now has. As you impact, you see it cut in

912
01:00:42,484 --> 01:00:51,308
half. It releases this putrid cloud of whatever
gases its body holds in it. I need you to make a

913
01:00:51,308 --> 01:00:53,065
constitution saving throw, please.

914
01:00:53,065 --> 01:00:54,518
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

915
01:00:57,134 --> 01:00:59,184
TRAVIS: Nine, 13.

916
01:00:59,184 --> 01:01:04,840
MATT: You manage to hold your breath and back out
of it as it dissipates around you. That finishes

917
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:05,633
your turn?

918
01:01:05,633 --> 01:01:06,587
TRAVIS: Yes, it does.

919
01:01:06,587 --> 01:01:09,792
LAURA: Fjord! Why you got to fart while we're
fighting?

920
01:01:09,792 --> 01:01:11,654
TRAVIS: I got nervous!

921
01:01:11,654 --> 01:01:18,398
SAM: There's a couple rats within range of my
allies, right? So that I could get sneak attack?

922
01:01:18,398 --> 01:01:23,170
MATT: Correct! There's one right there. Each one
of these is considered one spot between you.

923
01:01:23,170 --> 01:01:31,992
SAM: Okay, I'll disengage, back away down that
hall that way, get far enough away, then turn

924
01:01:31,992 --> 01:01:38,703
around back, go (whimper), and fire my crossbow at
the one next to Jester. No, that's Molly.

925
01:01:38,703 --> 01:01:41,193
MATT: Right there. Okay, go for it. Roll for
attack.

926
01:01:41,714 --> 01:01:43,490
SAM: 15 plus four, I think?

927
01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:45,288
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

928
01:01:45,288 --> 01:01:49,572
SAM: Okay. That's a lot of d6s. Right? Yeah.

929
01:01:52,749 --> 01:01:56,191
Okay, so. 15.

930
01:01:56,191 --> 01:02:03,350
MATT: It rears back and goes to leap in the air
towards Molly's face. It gets maybe two inches off

931
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:07,308
the ground before your bolt sinks right through
its skull, emerges on the other side, and it spins

932
01:02:07,308 --> 01:02:13,270
in the air. The momentum of its leap striking the
momentum of your bolt, and there's a spray of

933
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:18,828
blood in the air. This noxious cloud of gas
emerges from the wound that's left in the side of

934
01:02:18,971 --> 01:02:24,955
its throat. I need Molly, Beau, and Yasha to make
constitution saving throws, please.

935
01:02:27,035 --> 01:02:28,214
MARISHA: Not fun.

936
01:02:28,214 --> 01:02:29,927
(groaning)

937
01:02:29,927 --> 01:02:31,373
ASHLEY: Oh no.

938
01:02:31,373 --> 01:02:33,850
SAM: It's a small hole the bolt makes.

939
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:44,682
MATT: It's like popping a balloon. It (explosion).
They seem, based on the bacteria and whatever

940
01:02:44,682 --> 01:02:51,175
they've been living in, to be carrying a large
amount of this gas in their body. What'd you get?

941
01:02:51,175 --> 01:02:52,378
MARISHA: Natural one.

942
01:02:52,378 --> 01:02:54,489
ASHLEY: Eight.

943
01:02:54,489 --> 01:02:56,007
TALIESIN: 16.

944
01:02:56,007 --> 01:03:03,517
MATT: Molly, you pull away for the moment and put
your coat over the front and block it. The two of

945
01:03:03,517 --> 01:03:07,161
you, unintentionally, it gets into your nose, it
stings your eyes, you both take three points of

946
01:03:07,161 --> 01:03:08,163
poison damage.

947
01:03:08,163 --> 01:03:09,324
LAURA: Oh no.

948
01:03:09,324 --> 01:03:10,685
ASHLEY: Shit.

949
01:03:10,685 --> 01:03:12,805
MARISHA and TRAVIS: (gagging)

950
01:03:12,805 --> 01:03:13,782
MATT: Finished your turn, Nott?

951
01:03:13,782 --> 01:03:14,617
SAM: That's it.

952
01:03:14,617 --> 01:03:20,569
MATT: Beau, you're up. As you're coughing, it's
stinging all of your senses, and you right

953
01:03:20,569 --> 01:03:23,218
yourself and prepare for your turn.

954
01:03:24,646 --> 01:03:30,621
MARISHA: Oh sorry. Hang on, I'm taking damage.
One, two, three-- apply damage. I'm going to take

955
01:03:30,621 --> 01:03:35,816
this one that is in between, closest to me and
Yasha, and I'm going to do a big ol' golf swing

956
01:03:35,816 --> 01:03:45,515
with my quarterstaff. Not that dice, you were mean
to me. Ooh, that's good! 22 to hit.

957
01:03:45,515 --> 01:03:49,108
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

958
01:03:49,827 --> 01:03:54,409
MARISHA: Oh no, that's a four. I thought that was
a one for a second. Eight damage.

959
01:03:54,409 --> 01:04:00,700
MATT: Eight damage. Angrily, in response to this,
you sweep down with a giant golf swing of your

960
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:08,268
staff, and as it hits, it impacts, bludgeons the
side of its body. It gets slammed, hits the wall,

961
01:04:08,268 --> 01:04:16,518
and falls to the ground. Some of the gas seeps out
of its body, but it isn't exposed. It is dead, but

962
01:04:16,518 --> 01:04:22,659
the method of damage delivery seemingly didn't
disturb whatever was contained within its body.

963
01:04:22,659 --> 01:04:27,045
MARISHA: Interesting. I still have my other
attack, yeah? Can I move in and kick that guy?

964
01:04:27,045 --> 01:04:28,257
MATT: Over which one?

965
01:04:28,257 --> 01:04:32,925
MARISHA: Yeah, that one. I'm going to rat kick.
Rat kick.

966
01:04:35,534 --> 01:04:37,129
Natural 20!

967
01:04:37,129 --> 01:04:39,137
MATT: Jesus!

968
01:04:39,137 --> 01:04:45,962
MARISHA: Come on, give me that big ol' four--
That's a one! Six damage.

969
01:04:46,028 --> 01:04:54,267
MATT: You rush up and critically kick this rat in
the side of its body. Wham! You feel breaks and

970
01:04:54,267 --> 01:05:00,562
bones, or might be sticks, might be whatever else
has created this shell of debris about its body.

971
01:05:00,562 --> 01:05:07,078
It gives this screeching sound as falls over onto
its side and then gets back in its place. It's

972
01:05:07,078 --> 01:05:12,404
hurting, it's barely holding itself in place, but
it's angry and ready to snap back at you.

973
01:05:12,404 --> 01:05:14,671
MARISHA: I reach over to Yasha and I go--

974
01:05:17,112 --> 01:05:19,424
MATT: And it is Yasha's turn, actually.

975
01:05:19,424 --> 01:05:22,970
ASHLEY: Yeah. Wait, is this a dog next to Caleb,
what is this?

976
01:05:22,970 --> 01:05:29,816
MATT: No, those are all rats. I didn't have as
many rat minis for this. Use your imagination!

977
01:05:29,816 --> 01:05:33,544
TRAVIS: (laughing) I have reservations about
killing a sewer dog.

978
01:05:33,544 --> 01:05:34,969
ASHLEY: Okay, I think--

979
01:05:34,969 --> 01:05:37,065
MATT: You get the idea.

980
01:05:37,065 --> 01:05:43,966
ASHLEY: I think she's got this, so-- I don't want
anything to happen to Caleb. Can I get to any of

981
01:05:43,966 --> 01:05:46,071
the ones over by him?

982
01:05:46,071 --> 01:05:48,370
MATT: You have enough movement to get to any of
those.

983
01:05:48,370 --> 01:05:51,659
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'll move over to one of those.
Let's go to the one closest to him.

984
01:05:51,659 --> 01:05:54,619
MATT: Over here? One, two, three.

985
01:05:54,619 --> 01:05:59,665
ASHLEY: I'm going to-- Wait, so slashing-- so
bludgeoning keeps it from--

986
01:05:59,665 --> 01:06:01,243
LIAM: From breaking open.

987
01:06:01,243 --> 01:06:06,883
ASHLEY: I'm going to rear back and punch it.

988
01:06:06,883 --> 01:06:09,410
MATT: Okay, go for it. Make an attack roll.

989
01:06:09,410 --> 01:06:11,931
SAM and MARISHA: Punch it.

990
01:06:11,931 --> 01:06:15,895
MATT: Yasha the rat puncher! You're not raging,
right? It's just a regular attack.

991
01:06:17,398 --> 01:06:18,611
ASHLEY: 23.

992
01:06:18,611 --> 01:06:23,115
MATT: That hits. So it takes one point of damage,
plus whatever your strength modifier is.

993
01:06:23,115 --> 01:06:24,671
LAURA: That's good.

994
01:06:24,671 --> 01:06:28,931
TALIESIN: Don't you have a-- Actually, you've got
an unarmed strike.

995
01:06:28,931 --> 01:06:30,829
ASHLEY: Unarmed strike, yeah.

996
01:06:30,829 --> 01:06:34,346
LAURA: I look like I have an unarmed strike too,
but I don't think I do.

997
01:06:34,346 --> 01:06:35,890
ASHLEY: One, plus your strength modifier.

998
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:36,992
MATT: Yep.

999
01:06:36,992 --> 01:06:39,776
TALIESIN: So that means you can do four points of
damage. Technically, it's not one point, it's four

1000
01:06:39,776 --> 01:06:40,647
points--

1001
01:06:40,647 --> 01:06:43,971
MATT: Well, it's one point, and then she adds her
strength modifier to it. So four, yeah. So it

1002
01:06:43,971 --> 01:06:50,037
takes four points of damage. As you bludgeon it,
you hold the sword with one hand-- Or your sword's

1003
01:06:50,037 --> 01:06:53,395
probably still sheathed at this point, you're
holding the torch in one hand, so you rush up and

1004
01:06:53,395 --> 01:06:54,881
fist-punch it.

1005
01:06:54,881 --> 01:06:59,938
ASHLEY: Do I get-- I don't because I moved-- do I
get a bonus action? (mumbling) Still trying to

1006
01:06:59,938 --> 01:07:00,995
figure this out.

1007
01:07:00,995 --> 01:07:02,796
LIAM: Is the torch in your punching hand?

1008
01:07:03,381 --> 01:07:08,209
MATT: It's not a light weapon, it's not a weapon
you can off-hit with it.

1009
01:07:08,209 --> 01:07:11,464
ASHLEY: Can I just touch it? Set it aflame?

1010
01:07:11,464 --> 01:07:14,747
MATT: You could've if that was your action, but
you've already punched it. However, you did

1011
01:07:14,747 --> 01:07:22,514
straight up rush up and cold-cock deck a sewer rat
in the face. Once again, you feel the crunching

1012
01:07:22,514 --> 01:07:29,258
right behind it as it falls over and gets back up,
its jaw's hanging off to one side, and it has this

1013
01:07:29,258 --> 01:07:33,249
horrible gurgling sound as it screams at you. A
combination of this reddish blood and whatever

1014
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:36,889
putrid green liquid is mixing and pouring out of
its mouth.

1015
01:07:36,889 --> 01:07:39,254
ASHLEY: I move my cloak to--

1016
01:07:39,254 --> 01:07:44,875
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn then, right? All
right, it's now their turn. This one is going to

1017
01:07:44,875 --> 01:07:51,242
shift around, painfully limping to get down and
try to bite out towards your legs. This one's

1018
01:07:51,242 --> 01:07:55,969
going to move, still in combat with you, and go
after-- actually no, because you punched it, it's

1019
01:07:55,969 --> 01:07:59,863
going to continue after you. This one is going to
come after you as well, since you rushed up in its

1020
01:07:59,863 --> 01:08:05,383
way. So the one coming after Beau. That is going
to be a 15.

1021
01:08:05,383 --> 01:08:06,531
MARISHA: Miss.

1022
01:08:06,531 --> 01:08:12,007
MATT: Misses. You duck out of the way. The two
against you is a 16?

1023
01:08:12,007 --> 01:08:12,899
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm.

1024
01:08:12,899 --> 01:08:13,745
MATT: That hits?

1025
01:08:13,745 --> 01:08:14,766
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm.

1026
01:08:14,766 --> 01:08:22,168
MATT: All right, and a 17. Both hit. So you take,
from that first one, six points of piercing damage

1027
01:08:22,168 --> 01:08:24,642
as it leaps up and actually--

1028
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:26,565
ASHLEY: I have resistance to piercing.

1029
01:08:26,565 --> 01:08:28,035
MATT: You're not raging.

1030
01:08:28,035 --> 01:08:29,409
ASHLEY: Oh, you have to be raging?

1031
01:08:29,409 --> 01:08:31,316
MATT: Yeah, that's resistance from the rage.
That's okay.

1032
01:08:31,316 --> 01:08:33,197
ASHLEY: Okay, got it.

1033
01:08:33,197 --> 01:08:35,468
MATT: You can use a bonus action on your turn to
rage if you want to.

1034
01:08:35,468 --> 01:08:36,994
ASHLEY: Got it, okay.

1035
01:08:36,994 --> 01:08:41,282
MATT: It's okay. So you take six points of
piercing damage. As it bites up and you put your

1036
01:08:41,282 --> 01:08:45,271
arm in the way and it clamps onto your forearm, it
begins tearing. You shove it off and it lands onto

1037
01:08:45,271 --> 01:08:51,188
the ground, spins, and gets back to its feet. The
other one, you take four points of piercing

1038
01:08:51,188 --> 01:08:55,294
damage. As you shove that one off, the other one
leaps onto your back and begins snapping at the

1039
01:08:55,294 --> 01:08:58,974
back of your neck and shoulders, and you shove it
back onto the ground, and it readies itself for

1040
01:08:58,974 --> 01:09:04,476
another strike as they're slowly swarming around
you. Ending their turn now, Jester, you're up.

1041
01:09:04,476 --> 01:09:15,658
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to run up to the one that
just attacked Yasha. Yeah, and I'm going to hit it

1042
01:09:15,658 --> 01:09:20,678
with my handaxe because I'm not very smart.

1043
01:09:20,678 --> 01:09:24,399
MATT: Go for it. This is the one that's already
been punched too, so you rush up with your handaxe

1044
01:09:24,511 --> 01:09:26,044
and swing. Go and make an attack roll.

1045
01:09:26,044 --> 01:09:27,967
TRAVIS: You could flip it blade-up.

1046
01:09:29,313 --> 01:09:32,212
LAURA: That definitely hits. That's 21.

1047
01:09:32,212 --> 01:09:34,319
MATT: Yeah, that hits. Go and roll damage.

1048
01:09:38,372 --> 01:09:40,040
LAURA: That's a seven.

1049
01:09:40,153 --> 01:09:45,620
MATT: Seven points of damage. The rat that's face
is already broken, even when it managed to bite

1050
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:50,871
towards Yasha earlier, it was mostly dragging its
top fangs across the side of her forearm as its

1051
01:09:50,871 --> 01:09:56,427
jaw would not actually snap shut. You finish the
blow by taking the axe, swiping down. As you do,

1052
01:09:56,427 --> 01:10:03,629
you carve into its body and a cloud of poison
dissipates from its torso area. I need Yasha,

1053
01:10:03,629 --> 01:10:07,751
Caleb, and you, Jester, to make constitution
saving throws, please.

1054
01:10:08,393 --> 01:10:13,193
LAURA: Aw, you see it was like, (strains) no, fuck
you.

1055
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:15,000
ASHLEY: 19.

1056
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,730
MATT: Okay. You manage to hold yourself off, not
being taken into it a second time.

1057
01:10:18,730 --> 01:10:19,800
LIAM: Eight.

1058
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:25,045
MATT: Five points of poison damage to you as you
accidentally inhale a spray of it into your face,

1059
01:10:25,045 --> 01:10:27,267
you're like (gasping).

1060
01:10:27,267 --> 01:10:29,030
TRAVIS: It's in my mouth!

1061
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:31,036
MATT: Five? You also take five points of poison
damage.

1062
01:10:31,036 --> 01:10:33,083
LAURA: Oh no.

1063
01:10:33,083 --> 01:10:35,291
SAM: Tomato juice bath.

1064
01:10:35,291 --> 01:10:38,595
(laughter)

1065
01:10:38,595 --> 01:10:40,612
TRAVIS: That shit doesn't work.

1066
01:10:40,612 --> 01:10:41,993
TALIESIN: No, it doesn't help.

1067
01:10:41,993 --> 01:10:43,264
MATT: That end your turn, Jester?

1068
01:10:43,264 --> 01:10:46,166
LAURA: I think so.

1069
01:10:46,166 --> 01:10:47,910
MATT: Okay, so you finish coughing.

1070
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:50,942
LAURA: Wait! Yeah, I don't want to use that just
yet.

1071
01:10:50,942 --> 01:10:52,693
MATT: Okay, then Molly, you're up.

1072
01:10:52,693 --> 01:11:06,662
TALIESIN: I see the mess this is making, and I'm
going to turn around and I'm holding the sword,

1073
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:09,517
but I'm going to punch with the hilt of my sword.

1074
01:11:09,517 --> 01:11:13,824
MATT: Go for it. Which one are you going up to,
the one that Beau kicked earlier?

1075
01:11:13,824 --> 01:11:15,949
TALIESIN: No, the one that attacked Yasha.

1076
01:11:15,949 --> 01:11:23,022
MATT: Okay, go for it. Roll a d20 and add your
strength bonus.

1077
01:11:23,022 --> 01:11:25,564
TALIESIN: Plus my strength, my non-existent
strength modifier.

1078
01:11:28,985 --> 01:11:30,703
That's a 12 to hit.

1079
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:32,040
MATT: 12 just hits.

1080
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,378
TALIESIN: That's one damage!

1081
01:11:33,378 --> 01:11:37,097
MATT: You deal one point of damage to that one. As
you reach down and sock it in the head--

1082
01:11:37,097 --> 01:11:39,892
TALIESIN: I can take a bonus attack though, and
I'm going to hit it again.

1083
01:11:39,892 --> 01:11:41,872
MATT: Go for it.

1084
01:11:42,787 --> 01:11:43,786
TALIESIN: 12.

1085
01:11:43,786 --> 01:11:45,237
MATT: Well, are you attacking with your--

1086
01:11:45,237 --> 01:11:48,491
TALIESIN: Well, I'm using my other hand, since
technically I have two attacks, it's not two--

1087
01:11:48,491 --> 01:11:52,861
MATT: You have two attacks with the light weapon
on the side, technically. Eh, I'll allow it. It's

1088
01:11:52,861 --> 01:11:53,990
fine, go for it.

1089
01:11:53,990 --> 01:11:55,596
TALIESIN: It's another point of damage.

1090
01:11:55,596 --> 01:12:01,978
MATT: Okay, so it takes two points of damage. So
now you guys are rat punching. You guys are going

1091
01:12:01,978 --> 01:12:04,283
through and punching the fuck out of rats.

1092
01:12:04,283 --> 01:12:06,635
TRAVIS: Punching the fuck out of rats.

1093
01:12:06,635 --> 01:12:08,994
MATT: Repeatedly decking the face--

1094
01:12:08,994 --> 01:12:11,161
TRAVIS: Fuck you, you dirty rat.

1095
01:12:11,161 --> 01:12:15,129
MATT: Your knuckles are bleeding a little bit.
It's not really enough to damage you, but as

1096
01:12:15,129 --> 01:12:21,531
you're punching down, you're hitting slick oiled
fur and jagged points of broken wood and whatever

1097
01:12:21,647 --> 01:12:26,296
else has jammed itself into its matted fur. But
you've managed to hit it a couple of times and

1098
01:12:26,296 --> 01:12:30,432
it's taken a little bit of damage, but it's still
like (snarls). It looks very cornered and lashing

1099
01:12:30,432 --> 01:12:33,710
out now. That ends your turn, Molly. Caleb, you're
up.

1100
01:12:33,710 --> 01:12:38,742
LIAM: I would like to start backing up towards, in
this direction, towards Nott, away.

1101
01:12:38,742 --> 01:12:40,395
LAURA: Oh no.

1102
01:12:40,395 --> 01:12:46,701
LIAM: Oh no. I would use a Caleb bonus action to
dry heave and then I will use my action to cast

1103
01:12:46,701 --> 01:12:51,197
Fire Bolt towards the rat by Yasha.

1104
01:12:51,197 --> 01:12:53,255
MATT: By Yasha, go for it. Roll for the attack.

1105
01:12:53,255 --> 01:12:57,962
LIAM: Ja. (groans) That it is a-- oh no, that's
okay. It's a 13.

1106
01:12:57,962 --> 01:13:01,449
MATT: 13 hits. Go and roll damage on the Fire
Bolt. It's a d10, right?

1107
01:13:01,449 --> 01:13:04,246
LIAM: Ja, d10. It's five hit points of damage.

1108
01:13:04,246 --> 01:13:07,251
MATT: Five? Between the punches you gave it,
that's enough to finish it.

1109
01:13:07,251 --> 01:13:09,429
(cheering)

1110
01:13:09,429 --> 01:13:14,142
MATT: As you run back, you finish dry heaving and
then release the bolt of fire. It rockets past,

1111
01:13:14,142 --> 01:13:20,890
the sewer walls light up in succession down,
following the streak of flame through. As it

1112
01:13:20,890 --> 01:13:28,421
impacts, there's a burst and, what would have been
the gas that is released from its body,

1113
01:13:28,421 --> 01:13:35,755
incinerates from the fire damage and does not
affect anyone surrounding it. All righty,

1114
01:13:35,755 --> 01:13:39,109
finishing Caleb's turn, that brings us to the top.
Nott and Fjord.

1115
01:13:39,109 --> 01:13:40,272
LAURA: Are there more rats?

1116
01:13:40,272 --> 01:13:44,078
MATT: There is one more over here that's limping
next to Beau.

1117
01:13:44,078 --> 01:13:46,241
SAM: Where's our order?

1118
01:13:46,241 --> 01:13:48,864
TRAVIS: It's down here! It's rats, we're not using
that shit.

1119
01:13:48,903 --> 01:13:50,744
(laughter)

1120
01:13:50,744 --> 01:13:58,552
SAM: All right. Nott will go forward next to Caleb
and peer around, and fire another crossbow.

1121
01:13:58,552 --> 01:14:01,500
MARISHA: Oh no, I got it! God!

1122
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:05,948
SAM: I know! I haven't been in any gas, I don't
know what's going on. All I can see is you guys

1123
01:14:05,948 --> 01:14:10,993
going (yelling) like weirdos. So I'll fire.

1124
01:14:10,993 --> 01:14:12,459
MATT: Go for it.

1125
01:14:12,459 --> 01:14:15,754
MARISHA: Aw, too helpful. You're being too
helpful!

1126
01:14:15,754 --> 01:14:16,966
SAM: 18.

1127
01:14:16,966 --> 01:14:18,406
MATT: 18 hits. Roll damage.

1128
01:14:21,316 --> 01:14:23,188
SAM: There's sneak attack damage too, right?

1129
01:14:23,284 --> 01:14:24,176
MATT: Yep.

1130
01:14:24,176 --> 01:14:27,000
SAM: That's a lot. In the teens.

1131
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,897
MATT: How do you want to do this?

1132
01:14:28,897 --> 01:14:31,935
SAM: I guess I will--

1133
01:14:31,935 --> 01:14:33,519
TRAVIS: Ray!

1134
01:14:33,519 --> 01:14:36,473
(laughter)

1135
01:14:36,473 --> 01:14:39,787
TALIESIN: Way to date yourself right there.

1136
01:14:39,787 --> 01:14:42,577
SAM: If there's a way to pin the rat to the wall,
I'll do that.

1137
01:14:42,577 --> 01:14:51,799
MATT: Okay. As you turn around the side of Caleb,
putting your second bolt in, spinning around,

1138
01:14:51,799 --> 01:14:57,154
firing, it strikes the side of it, and where you
hit it in the side, there's this large pocket of

1139
01:14:57,154 --> 01:15:02,738
stretched rat skin where it's pulled so far that
the fur itself is disparate and you can see the

1140
01:15:02,863 --> 01:15:08,926
peach flesh beneath the fur. As it hits, it
(explosion). It's a combination of force from both

1141
01:15:08,926 --> 01:15:13,736
the blow of the bolt and the propulsion of the
release of gas that sprays right in the direction

1142
01:15:13,736 --> 01:15:16,939
of Beau. I need you to make another constitution
saving throw, please.

1143
01:15:16,939 --> 01:15:20,075
TRAVIS: Save. You got it, smash it. You're rolling
the bad dice again.

1144
01:15:20,075 --> 01:15:25,056
MARISHA: It rolled a natural one again! Laura, put
it in jail.

1145
01:15:25,056 --> 01:15:27,897
MATT: That's okay, you only take one point of
poison damage, I rolled really low for that one.

1146
01:15:27,897 --> 01:15:30,619
LAURA: It's really pretty though, what a pretty
die.

1147
01:15:30,619 --> 01:15:32,264
MARISHA: (whimpering) I know.

1148
01:15:32,264 --> 01:15:34,099
MATT: You take one point of poison damage.

1149
01:15:34,099 --> 01:15:35,371
MARISHA: Okay.

1150
01:15:35,371 --> 01:15:36,867
LIAM: Everyone's catching their disease here.

1151
01:15:36,867 --> 01:15:43,734
LAURA: Oh no, Matt! Wait, how do we know where
we're going, though? How will we choose?

1152
01:15:43,885 --> 01:15:46,625
MATT: I'll leave this here as a visual aid, sure.

1153
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:49,430
TALIESIN: You worked to make it so nice.

1154
01:15:49,430 --> 01:15:53,657
MATT: This is the direction you guys had come in
from, so the liquid is traveling down this way,

1155
01:15:53,657 --> 01:15:57,791
and then down this way, and there is no liquid
from the side, and the web that you had destroyed

1156
01:15:57,791 --> 01:15:59,214
is up in this corner.

1157
01:15:59,214 --> 01:16:00,518
LAURA: Okay, we go that way.

1158
01:16:00,518 --> 01:16:01,777
MATT: You're going to go in this direction?

1159
01:16:01,777 --> 01:16:06,983
LIAM: Before we move, I am standing with two
flickering Calebs next to me and all three of us

1160
01:16:06,983 --> 01:16:07,983
look at Molly like Jim from The Office and they go
away.

1161
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:11,310
(laughter)

1162
01:16:11,310 --> 01:16:13,750
LAURA: Oh no, how hurt is everyone?

1163
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:15,678
TRAVIS: You gotta look in the camera.

1164
01:16:15,678 --> 01:16:16,607
TALIESIN: I did.

1165
01:16:16,607 --> 01:16:18,137
TRAVIS: Oh good, yeah.

1166
01:16:19,934 --> 01:16:24,043
ASHLEY: I mean, I'm 19 out of 32.

1167
01:16:24,175 --> 01:16:28,006
LAURA: Right? I should do a Cure Wounds on you.

1168
01:16:28,006 --> 01:16:29,578
ASHLEY: I'll take it.

1169
01:16:29,578 --> 01:16:33,744
LAURA: Okay. I cast Cure Wounds on Yasha!

1170
01:16:35,064 --> 01:16:36,738
LIAM: What were you down to?

1171
01:16:36,805 --> 01:16:38,177
ASHLEY: 19.

1172
01:16:38,177 --> 01:16:40,388
LAURA: That's above your whole--

1173
01:16:40,388 --> 01:16:42,151
LIAM: Yeah, that's my max.

1174
01:16:42,151 --> 01:16:43,363
ASHLEY: That's your max?!

1175
01:16:43,363 --> 01:16:44,695
LIAM: Yeah. I'm sitting at 14.

1176
01:16:44,695 --> 01:16:46,572
ASHLEY: Well, it's good I took the hits, you
know?

1177
01:16:46,572 --> 01:16:48,148
LIAM: Yeah, that's your job.

1178
01:16:48,148 --> 01:16:52,406
LAURA: That's why I said it. Eight points.

1179
01:16:52,406 --> 01:16:56,628
MATT: In comparison to some of the scents you've
encountered in this conflict, suddenly the rest of

1180
01:16:56,628 --> 01:16:58,571
the sewer doesn't smell as bad.

1181
01:16:58,571 --> 01:17:00,620
TRAVIS: Yup. Nostrils are burned right the fuck
out.

1182
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:01,764
MATT: Yeah.

1183
01:17:01,764 --> 01:17:06,093
LAURA: Oh. How hurt are you, Beau?

1184
01:17:06,093 --> 01:17:11,188
MARISHA: I'm all right. I'm only down five hit
points.

1185
01:17:11,188 --> 01:17:17,564
LAURA: Oh, okay. Let me know, you guys, because
I've got lots of healing! Because I'm the cleric.

1186
01:17:17,564 --> 01:17:19,526
TALIESIN: Seriously, Caleb, how are you?

1187
01:17:19,526 --> 01:17:22,821
LIAM: Ah, you know, I've been worse. It's okay.
I'm okay.

1188
01:17:22,821 --> 01:17:25,420
TALIESIN: If we hit you really hard, would you
still be standing up right now?

1189
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:27,012
LIAM: If who hits me very hard?

1190
01:17:27,012 --> 01:17:28,526
TALIESIN: That's a good question, I hadn't really
thought about that.

1191
01:17:28,526 --> 01:17:32,705
LIAM: If she hits me very hard, I am a dead man.
If she hits me very hard, I'm probably okay.

1192
01:17:32,705 --> 01:17:34,246
SAM: I would never hit you!

1193
01:17:34,246 --> 01:17:35,736
LIAM: I know, that's just-- you know, it's just
a--

1194
01:17:35,736 --> 01:17:37,488
SAM: I care for you, Caleb.

1195
01:17:37,488 --> 01:17:40,733
LIAM: You have a monster on your chest.

1196
01:17:40,733 --> 01:17:43,841
ASHLEY: Are you very scared?

1197
01:17:46,971 --> 01:17:48,766
LIAM: Generally, are you asking me?

1198
01:17:49,016 --> 01:17:50,659
ASHLEY: Just right now?

1199
01:17:50,659 --> 01:17:56,197
LIAM: Right now? No, because I am with all of you,
and those were just mice.

1200
01:17:56,197 --> 01:18:02,098
SAM: I am extremely scared right now, but I think
that we killed the monster and we can go back to

1201
01:18:02,098 --> 01:18:04,101
surface now, right?

1202
01:18:04,101 --> 01:18:05,929
ASHLEY: I don't think that that was the monster.

1203
01:18:05,929 --> 01:18:08,746
SAM: That was clearly something down here that's
been killing people.

1204
01:18:08,746 --> 01:18:11,424
LAURA: I think something's making those things
like that.

1205
01:18:11,424 --> 01:18:15,177
LIAM: The rats are not making webbing. There's
something else.

1206
01:18:15,177 --> 01:18:17,905
LAURA: Oh god, what if it's a giant spider?

1207
01:18:17,905 --> 01:18:19,711
LIAM: It's probably a giant spider.

1208
01:18:19,711 --> 01:18:24,265
LAURA: And it's infecting the rats. (whispering)
And they're turning into poisoned--

1209
01:18:24,265 --> 01:18:25,991
SAM: Spiders don't like rats, do they?

1210
01:18:25,991 --> 01:18:27,976
TALIESIN: Rat spiders! Ooh!

1211
01:18:27,976 --> 01:18:30,781
ASHLEY: I don't understand why those rats were--

1212
01:18:30,781 --> 01:18:32,593
LAURA: Poison balloons?

1213
01:18:32,593 --> 01:18:35,267
ASHLEY: (chuckling) Yes.

1214
01:18:35,267 --> 01:18:39,474
SAM: Did you see the one that kind of looked like
a dog, though? That was freaky.

1215
01:18:39,474 --> 01:18:42,153
TALIESIN: At first, I thought it was some sort of
evil gassy dog.

1216
01:18:42,153 --> 01:18:47,951
LIAM: Well, I would theorize that perhaps their
diet is 20% food and 80% diarrhea, so it's not

1217
01:18:47,951 --> 01:18:51,874
very surprising that they explode into fecal
matter.

1218
01:18:51,874 --> 01:19:00,088
MARISHA: Can I bend down and, covering with my
vest a little bit, see if I can search and figure

1219
01:19:00,088 --> 01:19:02,828
out exactly what these things are made out of?

1220
01:19:02,828 --> 01:19:06,628
MATT: Okay. As you push through one of the open
wounds from one of the ones that was cut through

1221
01:19:06,628 --> 01:19:18,313
by either Jester or Fjord. I'd say about a third
of the body mass is an assembled shell of refuse.

1222
01:19:18,313 --> 01:19:23,345
The interior of it appears to be rat or
animal-like. General array of organs, though a lot

1223
01:19:23,345 --> 01:19:31,070
of them have a colorless gray or beige appearance
to them, and a lot of them look to be in various

1224
01:19:31,070 --> 01:19:33,674
stages of necrosis, and there's a lot of infection
inside.

1225
01:19:33,674 --> 01:19:35,234
TRAVIS and LAURA: (groaning)

1226
01:19:35,234 --> 01:19:36,655
MATT: Yeah, it's pretty nasty.

1227
01:19:36,655 --> 01:19:37,968
MARISHA: Guys, I think these are undead rats.

1228
01:19:37,968 --> 01:19:39,221
LAURA: I think they're full of pus!

1229
01:19:39,221 --> 01:19:40,573
TALIESIN: Are they undead rats?

1230
01:19:40,573 --> 01:19:42,890
MATT: You can go ahead and make an intelligence
check.

1231
01:19:42,890 --> 01:19:43,754
TALIESIN: With advantage?

1232
01:19:43,754 --> 01:19:44,861
MATT: With advantage.

1233
01:19:44,861 --> 01:19:51,192
TALIESIN: All right. Where's my intelligence--
there we are. That's a-- no, that's a nine.

1234
01:19:51,192 --> 01:19:52,221
MATT: Nine.

1235
01:19:52,221 --> 01:19:54,232
TALIESIN, TRAVIS, LAURA, and ASHLEY: Nein!

1236
01:19:54,232 --> 01:19:55,580
LIAM: You could just say nine.

1237
01:19:55,580 --> 01:20:01,442
MATT: You would know enough, from the knowledge
that you have, that while there is necrosis in

1238
01:20:01,442 --> 01:20:05,468
there, it doesn't look like its fully in there.
These things are--

1239
01:20:05,468 --> 01:20:06,962
TALIESIN: Mostly undead?

1240
01:20:06,962 --> 01:20:14,391
MATT: Or at least, they were alive up until a
moment ago. These infections, when they continued

1241
01:20:14,391 --> 01:20:17,025
for a period of time, probably not for long.

1242
01:20:17,025 --> 01:20:18,639
MARISHA: Zombie rats?!

1243
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:21,593
LAURA: Just really infected rats.

1244
01:20:21,806 --> 01:20:24,348
LIAM: No, they had pinkeye in all their parts.

1245
01:20:24,348 --> 01:20:27,994
TRAVIS: You know this really isn't what we need.
This is only the appetizer, maybe we should try to

1246
01:20:27,994 --> 01:20:29,367
find the main course.

1247
01:20:29,367 --> 01:20:36,622
LAURA: We should keep going. Should we be more
sneaky, or should we just walk?

1248
01:20:36,622 --> 01:20:38,228
ASHLEY: Yeah, maybe we should be sneaky.

1249
01:20:38,228 --> 01:20:39,652
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think stealth would be a good
idea.

1250
01:20:39,652 --> 01:20:41,167
TALIESIN: Let's be sneaky.

1251
01:20:41,167 --> 01:20:43,399
TRAVIS: To the right.

1252
01:20:43,399 --> 01:20:47,674
MATT: To the right, okay. You do get a glance with
your torchlight, Yasha, as you glance up the path

1253
01:20:47,674 --> 01:20:54,664
across the way, and the path that curves around
the side, and you do see a few other similar

1254
01:20:54,664 --> 01:21:01,831
collections. Though not moving, or not reacting to
the vicinity of where you are. Even glancing at

1255
01:21:01,831 --> 01:21:08,358
the ones who were fighting you, you can see upon
closer look that their eyes are snowblind, or

1256
01:21:08,358 --> 01:21:16,303
infected to the point where they were very
nearsighted, or close to blind. The patches in the

1257
01:21:16,303 --> 01:21:18,928
distance you can see aren't reacting you your
presence.

1258
01:21:18,928 --> 01:21:20,693
LAURA: We could set them on fire from a distance.

1259
01:21:20,693 --> 01:21:22,479
TRAVIS: Or just don't disturb them.

1260
01:21:22,479 --> 01:21:26,013
LAURA: Yeah, but what if they all spring up. We
could just set them on fire.

1261
01:21:26,013 --> 01:21:27,354
SAM: Are we going that way?

1262
01:21:27,354 --> 01:21:28,612
MATT: No, you're going that way.

1263
01:21:28,612 --> 01:21:29,767
SAM: We're going a different way.

1264
01:21:29,767 --> 01:21:32,880
LAURA: Okay then, let them live, and die in
horrible pain.

1265
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,043
TALIESIN: Yes.

1266
01:21:34,043 --> 01:21:38,609
MATT: (laughs) I'd like you to all roll stealth
checks, please.

1267
01:21:38,609 --> 01:21:41,391
SAM: Stealth checks! Can you help someone there,
Jester?

1268
01:21:41,391 --> 01:21:42,850
LAURA: Oh yeah, here you go!

1269
01:21:42,850 --> 01:21:44,215
SAM: Not me, I don't need it.

1270
01:21:44,215 --> 01:21:49,639
LAURA: Who is the most noisy of us all? Which one
of you fuckers needs some help?

1271
01:21:49,639 --> 01:21:52,974
ASHLEY: I rolled shit for stealth, so it wouldn't
do me any good.

1272
01:21:52,974 --> 01:21:54,571
LAURA: Well here, take an advantage.

1273
01:21:54,571 --> 01:21:55,667
ASHLEY: Oh.

1274
01:21:55,667 --> 01:21:59,011
MATT: I'll let it happen. Usually you have to give
that before they roll so you don't know.

1275
01:21:59,106 --> 01:22:00,210
LAURA: Just kidding.

1276
01:22:00,210 --> 01:22:01,745
ASHLEY: Should I take up the rear?

1277
01:22:01,745 --> 01:22:03,439
LIAM: You're coming back after a break.

1278
01:22:03,439 --> 01:22:04,779
MATT: It's fine.

1279
01:22:04,779 --> 01:22:05,958
ASHLEY: 15?

1280
01:22:05,958 --> 01:22:07,005
MATT: 15 is better.

1281
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:08,730
TALIESIN: 12.

1282
01:22:08,730 --> 01:22:10,703
LAURA: Hold on, I have to check--

1283
01:22:10,703 --> 01:22:13,082
SAM: Ten. Not so good.

1284
01:22:13,082 --> 01:22:14,362
LAURA: Eight. Not so good.

1285
01:22:14,362 --> 01:22:15,319
LIAM: 16.

1286
01:22:15,319 --> 01:22:16,791
MARISHA and TRAVIS: 18.

1287
01:22:16,791 --> 01:22:23,082
MATT: Okay. As you guys continue down the right
pathway, you continue further and find the

1288
01:22:23,082 --> 01:22:32,418
clusters of makeshift bits of discarded material
begin to give way as about 20 feet ahead of you,

1289
01:22:32,418 --> 01:22:38,389
the torchlight begins to refract and reflect
against some sort of soft material that is

1290
01:22:38,389 --> 01:22:46,184
drifting and enclosing a portion of the walkway.
You see ahead of you a majority of the tunnel is

1291
01:22:46,184 --> 01:22:53,790
currently blocked, other than a small path on the
right side of it, by a dense webbing of some

1292
01:22:53,790 --> 01:22:54,976
kind.

1293
01:22:54,976 --> 01:22:56,510
LAURA: Let's set it on fire!

1294
01:22:56,510 --> 01:23:05,318
MATT: You see a large knot, or a-- not a Nott, a
knot of webbing as well, that is held aloft a foot

1295
01:23:05,318 --> 01:23:07,995
off the ground.

1296
01:23:07,995 --> 01:23:09,261
MARISHA: It's the egg sack.

1297
01:23:09,384 --> 01:23:10,432
SAM: Or a body.

1298
01:23:10,432 --> 01:23:15,897
LAURA: Or it could be somebody that's being slowly
sucked dry of all their blood.

1299
01:23:15,897 --> 01:23:17,954
MARISHA: You're totally right.

1300
01:23:17,954 --> 01:23:21,511
LAURA: Should we set it on fire, or should we see
if it's living?

1301
01:23:21,511 --> 01:23:24,493
TALIESIN: I think we should try to cut it down in
case it's a person.

1302
01:23:24,493 --> 01:23:26,090
LAURA: Is it wiggling at all?

1303
01:23:26,090 --> 01:23:27,789
MATT: Make a perception check.

1304
01:23:32,053 --> 01:23:33,086
LAURA: 15.

1305
01:23:33,086 --> 01:23:35,450
MATT: 15? It does not appear to be moving.

1306
01:23:35,450 --> 01:23:36,772
LAURA: I think it's dead.

1307
01:23:36,772 --> 01:23:38,130
SAM: You think its dead?

1308
01:23:38,130 --> 01:23:39,324
LAURA: Or it's sedated.

1309
01:23:39,324 --> 01:23:41,390
ASHLEY: What if we (blows air)?

1310
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:44,239
SAM: Should we go try to cut it down? Without
alerting them.

1311
01:23:44,239 --> 01:23:46,389
TRAVIS: You normally touch a spider's web, they
come running.

1312
01:23:46,389 --> 01:23:48,287
MARISHA: That's true.

1313
01:23:48,287 --> 01:23:52,855
LIAM: I have read a lot of books. Lots of them.
Have I ever read anything about the science of

1314
01:23:52,855 --> 01:23:55,639
larger insectoid creatures?

1315
01:23:55,639 --> 01:24:02,056
MATT: Possibly insectoids. This would not be,
technically, an insect.

1316
01:24:02,056 --> 01:24:04,224
LIAM: Okay, but it's not familiar to me?

1317
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:08,371
MATT: I mean, it's webbing. There are many
creatures in nature that use webbing in different

1318
01:24:08,371 --> 01:24:09,845
forms and types.

1319
01:24:09,845 --> 01:24:11,844
LIAM: Like YouTubers.

1320
01:24:11,844 --> 01:24:20,906
MATT: Yes, there's that too. Glancing at this, the
mass that is encased in the webbing is about this big.

1321
01:24:22,286 --> 01:24:24,189
LAURA: It's a dog.

1322
01:24:24,189 --> 01:24:26,318
MATT: It's about dog-sized.

1323
01:24:26,318 --> 01:24:28,840
TALIESIN: Or a rat.

1324
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:32,138
ASHLEY: Is it close enough to us?

1325
01:24:33,073 --> 01:24:35,187
MATT: It's about 20 feet ahead of you.

1326
01:24:35,187 --> 01:24:39,886
TRAVIS: Can we see a past that into any further
clumps of webbing?

1327
01:24:39,886 --> 01:24:43,994
MATT: Make a perception check with disadvantage,
because it does go beyond the torch threshold.

1328
01:24:43,994 --> 01:24:46,254
MARISHA: It doesn't appear to be human-sized.

1329
01:24:46,254 --> 01:24:47,840
MATT: That one does not, no.

1330
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,250
MARISHA: That one does not.

1331
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:50,541
TRAVIS: 14.

1332
01:24:50,541 --> 01:24:56,202
MATT: Looking past, you can see layers of webbing
continue for about, what you can see, 20 feet

1333
01:24:56,202 --> 01:25:02,303
beyond that. It looks to be an even heavier wall
of it behind that completely blocks continued

1334
01:25:02,303 --> 01:25:09,461
access into that chamber. You can see two other
much larger clusters of webbing that are wrapped

1335
01:25:09,461 --> 01:25:12,427
around something.

1336
01:25:12,427 --> 01:25:15,846
ASHLEY: Are we able to get to this lump?

1337
01:25:15,846 --> 01:25:17,589
MATT: You can get to it, yeah.

1338
01:25:17,589 --> 01:25:19,917
ASHLEY: Or do we have to go through some of the
web?

1339
01:25:19,917 --> 01:25:26,741
MATT: There's bits of it that are drifting below.
You see that it does shift every now and then. It

1340
01:25:26,741 --> 01:25:32,128
looks like there's some sort of a breeze coming
through, faint as it is. That's why, from the

1341
01:25:32,128 --> 01:25:36,510
webbing that is currently held aloft between the
ceiling and the floor and the left wall, from your

1342
01:25:36,510 --> 01:25:42,822
perspective, the first one you see, every now and
then you see it faintly shift, as if a breeze or

1343
01:25:42,822 --> 01:25:44,428
water moves through.

1344
01:25:44,428 --> 01:25:46,601
TRAVIS: Do we have to break any of the planes of
webbing to get to this cluster?

1345
01:25:46,601 --> 01:25:47,793
MATT: To get to this one? No.

1346
01:25:47,793 --> 01:25:49,109
LAURA: Let's cut it down.

1347
01:25:49,109 --> 01:25:51,506
ASHLEY: Maybe we can look at it up closer?

1348
01:25:51,506 --> 01:25:52,857
MATT: You can.

1349
01:25:52,857 --> 01:25:58,186
TALIESIN: I'm going to try to very gently, maybe,
with everyone's permission I'm going to gently

1350
01:25:58,186 --> 01:26:00,595
start cutting into the bottom of it, not too
deeply.

1351
01:26:00,595 --> 01:26:08,262
SAM: Wait! Should we get ready for some sort of
distraction or to do something to the other web first?

1352
01:26:08,387 --> 01:26:09,695
TALIESIN: I'm sorry, do you have a plan?

1353
01:26:09,695 --> 01:26:10,706
SAM: No, no, I just--

1354
01:26:10,706 --> 01:26:13,118
TALIESIN: Well, all right then. I keep moving
downward.

1355
01:26:13,118 --> 01:26:16,208
MATT: Okay, is this the one with your activated
rite?

1356
01:26:16,208 --> 01:26:17,558
TALIESIN: Yes.

1357
01:26:17,558 --> 01:26:19,788
MATT: And the rite you activated was?

1358
01:26:19,788 --> 01:26:21,395
TALIESIN: It was the radiant rite.

1359
01:26:21,395 --> 01:26:26,991
MATT: The Rite of the Dawn. As his scimitar, which
is now glowing with this faint radiant light

1360
01:26:26,991 --> 01:26:33,864
energy, it almost burns through as you carve
through. Slowly, it's not an easy cut, but you do

1361
01:26:33,964 --> 01:26:38,962
carve through. As you do, the webbing begins to
curl back and blacken at the edges. As it pulls

1362
01:26:38,962 --> 01:26:45,744
away, you see something furry and fleshy. As you
pull it back a few more inches, you watch as a rat

1363
01:26:45,744 --> 01:26:56,082
head, lolls out, a tongue falling out the side. It
looks to be dry, it looks to be bereft of any sort

1364
01:26:56,082 --> 01:26:58,487
of internal liquid or life.

1365
01:26:58,487 --> 01:27:02,038
LAURA: That's good to know. That means the
human-sized ones are probably fucked up too.

1366
01:27:02,038 --> 01:27:04,798
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's probably true.

1367
01:27:04,798 --> 01:27:06,458
TALIESIN: Or they haven't been eaten yet.

1368
01:27:06,458 --> 01:27:10,410
LAURA: How long ago did they say the guards went
down and didn't come back?

1369
01:27:10,410 --> 01:27:14,830
TRAVIS: Quite a while, but I'll remind you that
our mission is not to retrieve any guards. It's to

1370
01:27:14,830 --> 01:27:16,372
kill this beast.

1371
01:27:16,372 --> 01:27:22,091
LIAM: If we kill the beasts that are down here,
then it might be worthwhile to also check the

1372
01:27:22,091 --> 01:27:25,538
bodies of the guards, you know, because they're
not going back to the to their families, you

1373
01:27:25,538 --> 01:27:27,386
following me?

1374
01:27:27,386 --> 01:27:29,744
TRAVIS: That was dark and angry.

1375
01:27:29,744 --> 01:27:31,447
SAM: Steal from the dead bodies?

1376
01:27:31,447 --> 01:27:32,757
LIAM: Well, they're not going to use it.

1377
01:27:32,757 --> 01:27:34,403
SAM: I agree. Yeah.

1378
01:27:34,403 --> 01:27:36,006
TALIESIN: I'll work with that.

1379
01:27:36,006 --> 01:27:40,868
TRAVIS: Shall we move forward to the first plane
of webbing that would hinder our movement?

1380
01:27:40,868 --> 01:27:44,551
LIAM: Just a suggestion, we don't have to do this,
I'm not even sure how I feel about it, but I have

1381
01:27:44,551 --> 01:27:51,687
just learned how to create a somewhat spectral
servant to me, one that is unseen. I could send it

1382
01:27:51,687 --> 01:27:56,694
in to poke about and if anything is going to
happen, it could happen to it first, instead of us.

1383
01:27:56,810 --> 01:27:58,160
SAM: I like that idea.

1384
01:27:58,160 --> 01:27:59,821
TRAVIS: Does it interact with the environment?

1385
01:27:59,821 --> 01:28:01,771
LIAM: Yeah, it could poke at things and you know.

1386
01:28:01,771 --> 01:28:03,760
MARISHA: Would it move the webbing as it went
through?

1387
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:05,161
LIAM: Yeah.

1388
01:28:05,161 --> 01:28:08,979
TRAVIS: What do we like more? Poking the webbing,
or sending it up in flame?

1389
01:28:08,979 --> 01:28:13,213
MARISHA: I agree with Fjord. I think we we start
poking around, that thing's going to come running.

1390
01:28:13,420 --> 01:28:14,742
TRAVIS: Might as well--

1391
01:28:14,742 --> 01:28:16,590
SAM: But then we'll get to see it, and get the
drop on it.

1392
01:28:16,590 --> 01:28:18,707
LIAM: If you burn its web it will do the same
thing.

1393
01:28:18,707 --> 01:28:20,946
LAURA: Yeah. What if we back up and burn it?

1394
01:28:20,946 --> 01:28:25,421
TRAVIS: My way of thinking is what if that web is
sticky as shit. I don't want to get caught in it.

1395
01:28:25,495 --> 01:28:27,789
LAURA: That's why I said; why don't we back up and
burn it?

1396
01:28:27,789 --> 01:28:30,047
LIAM: I think that's actually a very good idea.

1397
01:28:30,047 --> 01:28:33,085
TALIESIN: Let's try and not set fire to the human
shaped things.

1398
01:28:33,085 --> 01:28:35,026
SAM: Yeah. What if they're still alive?

1399
01:28:35,026 --> 01:28:41,661
LAURA: Well, Caleb, how about you send your
spectral servant to poke at the little masses of

1400
01:28:41,661 --> 01:28:44,983
human and see if they start wiggling?

1401
01:28:44,983 --> 01:28:50,584
LIAM: Okay. Also, I will say that, you were
worried about burning their dead bodies. But if we

1402
01:28:50,584 --> 01:28:55,074
burn the dead bodies they might burn, we're not
going to help them, but if any coin have, or any

1403
01:28:55,074 --> 01:28:58,239
items that are magical in nature will be fine. So
it's okay.

1404
01:28:58,239 --> 01:28:59,645
SAM: Oh, yeah, that's good.

1405
01:28:59,645 --> 01:29:02,251
ASHLEY: The thing is, if we kill them, I mean,
we're putting them out of their misery. You know.

1406
01:29:02,251 --> 01:29:06,110
LAURA: They'll probably end up as giant pus sacks
if they survive.

1407
01:29:06,197 --> 01:29:07,553
ASHLEY: Yeah, they're probably already--

1408
01:29:07,553 --> 01:29:11,328
SAM: Or maybe they just were wrapped up five
minutes ago, and they're totally fine.

1409
01:29:11,328 --> 01:29:15,702
LIAM: Yeah, that's possible. This thing that I can
do, this servant that I can make, It's not going

1410
01:29:15,702 --> 01:29:18,441
to be able to open these things. It's very weak.

1411
01:29:18,441 --> 01:29:21,211
LAURA: I said poke it. Then if they wiggle, then
we know that they're alive.

1412
01:29:21,211 --> 01:29:22,563
LIAM: That's true.

1413
01:29:22,563 --> 01:29:24,143
TRAVIS: How about a poke and then a flame?

1414
01:29:24,143 --> 01:29:25,797
TALIESIN: Poke and wiggle. Then a flame.

1415
01:29:25,797 --> 01:29:28,203
ASHLEY: I think if they start moving, this thing's
going to--

1416
01:29:28,203 --> 01:29:30,100
TALIESIN: Well, it knows that they're alive---

1417
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:31,726
ASHLEY: But then we'll get eyes on it.

1418
01:29:31,726 --> 01:29:33,687
TALIESIN: So I'm sure they wiggle every now and
then anyway.

1419
01:29:33,687 --> 01:29:37,461
TRAVIS: That way Nott doesn't have bad dreams that
we burn some people that are still alive and then

1420
01:29:37,461 --> 01:29:38,772
we can set it all on fire.

1421
01:29:38,772 --> 01:29:41,276
MARISHA: Oh, no, that was Caleb who was freaked
out by fire.

1422
01:29:41,276 --> 01:29:42,368
TRAVIS: Oh, right.

1423
01:29:42,368 --> 01:29:43,520
MARISHA: Yeah.

1424
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:44,759
LAURA: Do it, Caleb!

1425
01:29:44,843 --> 01:29:49,261
LIAM: I pull a stick out of my coat, and I hold it
between thumb and pinky like this, and there's a

1426
01:29:49,261 --> 01:29:53,029
string wrapped around it, and I take my fingers,
and I pull along the string, which begins to glow

1427
01:29:53,029 --> 01:30:00,799
a faint gold glow, and a being, same height, and
about same skinny-ass proportions as myself

1428
01:30:00,799 --> 01:30:02,578
appears before me.

1429
01:30:02,578 --> 01:30:03,834
MATT: Well, it does not appear.

1430
01:30:03,834 --> 01:30:05,641
LIAM: It doesn't appear? You tell me, because
you're the dungeon master.

1431
01:30:05,641 --> 01:30:08,655
MATT: It's unseen, but you sense its presence
arrive.

1432
01:30:08,655 --> 01:30:10,281
LAURA: It's unseen.

1433
01:30:11,611 --> 01:30:13,286
ASHLEY: Oh, that's what that means.

1434
01:30:13,286 --> 01:30:19,455
MATT: On the dry, dust-covered floor of this
interior part of the sewer, where the temperature

1435
01:30:19,564 --> 01:30:24,946
has dropped and is a little less humid in this
area, there are two small plumes of dust on the

1436
01:30:24,946 --> 01:30:29,354
ground and you sense the servant has arrived.

1437
01:30:29,354 --> 01:30:32,202
LAURA: I go up and I push it.

1438
01:30:32,202 --> 01:30:37,373
MATT: Okay, you put your hand forward and it's
like hitting the back of someone's back, but

1439
01:30:37,373 --> 01:30:41,139
there's nothing there and it catches you off
guard, you're like "What the heck?" It feels

1440
01:30:41,139 --> 01:30:46,971
somewhat amorphous, like a heavy wind pushback for
a second, but there's no wind and there's no

1441
01:30:46,971 --> 01:30:49,659
whipping of force around your arm. It's very
strange.

1442
01:30:49,659 --> 01:30:52,249
LAURA: I think your unseen servant farted on me.

1443
01:30:52,249 --> 01:31:03,119
LIAM: Well the rats have already started. So
Schmidt, I want you to go to these larger bundles

1444
01:31:03,119 --> 01:31:05,594
and give them a little pokey-poo.

1445
01:31:05,594 --> 01:31:11,024
MATT: All right, Schmidt goes past--

1446
01:31:11,024 --> 01:31:13,930
(laughter)

1447
01:31:13,930 --> 01:31:19,916
MATT: You sense this-- the first webbing barricade
which has a small five-foot space between it and

1448
01:31:19,916 --> 01:31:25,101
the wall, to the next one, the one that you saw,
which encompasses the entirety of this wall. There

1449
01:31:25,101 --> 01:31:30,693
are small one-foot wide sections of it along the
upper part of the wall where there's a gap, but

1450
01:31:30,693 --> 01:31:36,955
most of it is pure web across. There are two of
them there and are you getting close with the

1451
01:31:36,955 --> 01:31:41,597
torch to reveal it? Otherwise it's going to be
beyond the torch light, it's going to be very dim

1452
01:31:41,597 --> 01:31:43,285
and hard to see the details.

1453
01:31:43,285 --> 01:31:45,402
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll follow as far back as I can.

1454
01:31:45,402 --> 01:31:47,989
LIAM: I have to stay within 60 feet of Schmidt.

1455
01:31:47,989 --> 01:31:54,842
MATT: Right, so the two of you approach the first
barrier to see the second. As Schmidt approaches

1456
01:31:54,842 --> 01:32:03,642
the second barrier, one of the masses, which does
appear to be humanoid in size, shakes slightly,

1457
01:32:04,667 --> 01:32:12,549
doesn't react. The other one shakes slightly, and
you watch as an arm limply falls from the side of

1458
01:32:12,549 --> 01:32:17,788
it, some webbing tearing, as it does you hear a
metal sword clang to the ground. You see a bracer

1459
01:32:17,788 --> 01:32:22,783
that once belonged to a crownsguard.

1460
01:32:22,783 --> 01:32:26,992
LIAM: (whispers) Schmidt, bring me the bracer.

1461
01:32:26,992 --> 01:32:31,482
MATT: The bracer (whoosh) and drifts on its own in
your direction.

1462
01:32:33,972 --> 01:32:36,677
LAURA: I wonder if the giant spider thing heard
that.

1463
01:32:37,724 --> 01:32:38,899
LIAM: What?

1464
01:32:38,899 --> 01:32:39,955
MARISHA: Yeah, probably.

1465
01:32:39,955 --> 01:32:41,474
LIAM: What did you say? I did not understand your
accent.

1466
01:32:41,474 --> 01:32:42,748
LAURA: (loudly) I said I wonder if the giant--

1467
01:32:42,748 --> 01:32:43,848
LIAM: Shh!

1468
01:32:43,848 --> 01:32:45,065
LAURA: You.

1469
01:32:47,625 --> 01:32:49,541
SAM: She wonders if the giant spider heard it.

1470
01:32:49,951 --> 01:32:51,849
LIAM: Yeah, we all wonder that.

1471
01:32:51,849 --> 01:32:54,709
TRAVIS: So they're dead, huh?

1472
01:32:54,709 --> 01:32:57,053
LIAM: Well, not moving.

1473
01:32:57,053 --> 01:33:01,475
LAURA: Burn that shit then the spider will come
and we will burn that shit too!

1474
01:33:01,475 --> 01:33:04,165
ASHLEY: How close am I to one of the human form
ones?

1475
01:33:04,165 --> 01:33:05,837
MATT: You're about ten feet from it.

1476
01:33:05,837 --> 01:33:07,113
TALIESIN: They look pretty dead, don't they?

1477
01:33:07,113 --> 01:33:08,626
MATT: They look pretty dead, they're ten to 15
feet from you.

1478
01:33:08,626 --> 01:33:10,168
TRAVIS: Firestarter!

1479
01:33:10,168 --> 01:33:12,195
ASHLEY: I mean this is the firestarter over here.

1480
01:33:12,195 --> 01:33:13,695
MARISHA: Let's burn it.

1481
01:33:13,695 --> 01:33:15,753
LIAM: I can do it from a distance, yeah.

1482
01:33:15,753 --> 01:33:18,777
SAM: Should we get into some sort of position so
we're not all clumped together?

1483
01:33:18,777 --> 01:33:21,377
MATT: Yeah, do you have any specific order you
want to maintain here?

1484
01:33:21,377 --> 01:33:26,451
TRAVIS: How about four on one side and three on
the other of the tunnel?

1485
01:33:26,451 --> 01:33:28,270
TALIESIN: That'll do.

1486
01:33:28,270 --> 01:33:32,141
ASHLEY: Caleb, do you want to stand behind me and
little peeksies from behind?

1487
01:33:32,141 --> 01:33:33,864
LIAM: I would like to stand behind everybody.

1488
01:33:33,864 --> 01:33:36,663
TRAVIS: I'll take the front of the other side of
Yasha, since I've got some armor.

1489
01:33:36,663 --> 01:33:38,690
LAURA: I'll stand behind Fjord.

1490
01:33:38,690 --> 01:33:40,596
MATT: All right.

1491
01:33:40,596 --> 01:33:43,888
MARISHA: I guess I'll go with team Caleb/Yasha.

1492
01:33:43,888 --> 01:33:46,291
TRAVIS: Wow. Fucking betrayal. Okay.

1493
01:33:46,444 --> 01:33:48,379
MATT: All right, Caleb, Yasha and Beau--

1494
01:33:48,379 --> 01:33:50,377
MARISHA: I'm trying to split up evenly!

1495
01:33:50,377 --> 01:33:52,453
MATT: Is it Molly and Fjord at the front of the
other group?

1496
01:33:52,453 --> 01:33:53,974
SAM: I'll go behind Caleb.

1497
01:33:53,974 --> 01:33:58,664
MATT: Okay, so Nott goes behind Caleb and then we
have Fjord and Molly on the other side with Jester

1498
01:33:58,664 --> 01:34:00,396
behind them.

1499
01:34:00,396 --> 01:34:04,530
TALIESIN: Yep. Little bit of magic on both sides,
little bit of tank.

1500
01:34:04,530 --> 01:34:11,988
MATT: Okay. You move around that barrier and get
to the next ten to 15 feet up where there is the

1501
01:34:11,988 --> 01:34:17,574
next larger barrier of webbing and the two
unmoving humanoid forms wrapped up there.

1502
01:34:17,574 --> 01:34:23,208
LIAM: I can do this from 120 feet away, once every
six seconds I'm going to use Fire Bolt. I would go

1503
01:34:23,208 --> 01:34:26,502
(whoosh whoosh) and hit them both.

1504
01:34:26,502 --> 01:34:33,269
MATT: Okay. They both impact and the bodies shift,
there's a burst of flame. Some of the webbing

1505
01:34:33,269 --> 01:34:39,823
ignites and burns and curls away, but it looks
like the flame is so instantaneous it's not enough

1506
01:34:39,823 --> 01:34:46,322
to immediately ignite the webbing. There is a
burnt mark on them and neither of the forms move

1507
01:34:46,322 --> 01:34:50,564
or react to the impact and the web shifts and
shakes for a moment before it eventually comes to

1508
01:34:50,564 --> 01:34:51,703
rest again.

1509
01:34:51,703 --> 01:34:54,144
LIAM: Just as a test, to the one on the right I do
it again.

1510
01:34:54,144 --> 01:34:59,026
MATT: Okay, you do it a second time. It burns a
little more, as the webbing burns away in that

1511
01:34:59,026 --> 01:35:04,009
section you can see the crownsguard armor
chestplate that is now a little bit charred

1512
01:35:04,009 --> 01:35:05,678
beneath the impact.

1513
01:35:05,678 --> 01:35:09,633
LIAM: Okay, well, he's dead. Should I just keep
chipping away?

1514
01:35:09,633 --> 01:35:12,497
MARISHA: You still have your torch, yeah?

1515
01:35:12,497 --> 01:35:16,384
ASHLEY: Yeah. I'll help. Are we moving forward or
we're still--?

1516
01:35:16,384 --> 01:35:18,541
MATT: They're all still in the back, but you can
move forward if you want to move forward.

1517
01:35:18,541 --> 01:35:22,396
LIAM: Well, this is every six seconds so I could
just stand here for a minute going (whoosh whoosh

1518
01:35:22,396 --> 01:35:24,291
whoosh) and not get close.

1519
01:35:24,291 --> 01:35:28,529
TRAVIS: Hey Nott, will you do me a favor and make
sure nothing sneaks up behind us?

1520
01:35:28,529 --> 01:35:31,013
SAM: There's things behind us, too?

1521
01:35:31,013 --> 01:35:32,066
TRAVIS: Could be.

1522
01:35:32,066 --> 01:35:36,311
LIAM: So I guess I'll take the next 30 or 40
seconds, if that's what it takes. I'll focus on

1523
01:35:36,311 --> 01:35:38,008
one and just keep burning it away.

1524
01:35:38,008 --> 01:35:39,094
MATT: Okay.

1525
01:35:39,094 --> 01:35:41,167
SAM: I'm going to go 15 feet behind us.

1526
01:35:41,167 --> 01:35:47,991
MATT: Okay, you shift yourself 15 feet behind.
Make a perception check so you can watch. With

1527
01:35:47,991 --> 01:35:51,085
disadvantage because, unfortunately, you're away
from the torch light to do so.

1528
01:35:51,732 --> 01:35:52,888
SAM: That's a one.

1529
01:35:52,888 --> 01:35:54,554
MATT: So you're keeping watch.

1530
01:35:54,554 --> 01:35:57,274
(laughter)

1531
01:35:57,274 --> 01:36:02,644
MATT: As one after the other the webbing is
shaking and shifting. Eventually, after four or

1532
01:36:02,644 --> 01:36:07,001
five blasts the web begins to catch fire and you
watch as the red and orange flames expand and

1533
01:36:07,001 --> 01:36:12,778
begin to immolate both the unmoving bodies. The
webbing then burns away and eventually begins to

1534
01:36:12,778 --> 01:36:18,872
detach from the weight and the loss of tensile
strength and that whole wall shifts and collapses

1535
01:36:18,872 --> 01:36:22,844
to the ground, both of the bodies hit the ground.
The webbing burns away, it's not enough to catch

1536
01:36:22,844 --> 01:36:26,833
the bodies on fire, though it does singe and burn
the exterior and as you look they're both in

1537
01:36:26,833 --> 01:36:33,542
various states of decay. The skin you can see, as
you approach a little bit, Yasha, to take a look,

1538
01:36:33,542 --> 01:36:39,311
the cheeks within their helmeted heads are sunken
and sallow. The lips are curled back over the

1539
01:36:39,311 --> 01:36:44,932
teeth. They are drained of any internal life force
or blood.

1540
01:36:44,932 --> 01:36:49,382
ASHLEY: Can I poke around with the tip of my sword
and see if there's any money or something in their pockets?

1541
01:36:49,540 --> 01:36:51,385
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1542
01:36:51,768 --> 01:36:54,087
LIAM: (singing) We are the worst. We are the
worst.

1543
01:36:54,087 --> 01:36:55,321
TALIESIN: He's not using it.

1544
01:36:55,321 --> 01:36:56,520
ASHLEY: 18.

1545
01:36:56,520 --> 01:37:03,822
MATT: Prodding around, yeah, there is. From just a
glance, they both have coin purses on their belts,

1546
01:37:03,822 --> 01:37:10,440
folded into their belt, as a protective measure.
They both look like they were caught in a state

1547
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:14,093
where they'd be willing to travel anywhere and
spend money.

1548
01:37:14,093 --> 01:37:15,841
ASHLEY: I'll take them.

1549
01:37:15,841 --> 01:37:20,388
MATT: Okay, you being to pull from their bodies,
what are the rest of you guys doing?

1550
01:37:20,538 --> 01:37:26,160
LAURA: We could take their weapons, I bet they're
nice weapons. Or we could return them to the

1551
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:28,801
Crownsguard, maybe they would reward us?

1552
01:37:28,801 --> 01:37:30,590
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Do they have a dog tag?

1553
01:37:30,590 --> 01:37:37,657
MATT: Glancing about as you inspect the bodies,
there's no identifying tag to them. There isn't an

1554
01:37:37,657 --> 01:37:42,624
elaborate system of maintaining Crownsguard
members or identifying that you've noticed at

1555
01:37:42,624 --> 01:37:43,557
least.

1556
01:37:43,557 --> 01:37:47,170
TRAVIS: Can I search for puncture marks? Stab
wounds? Bite marks?

1557
01:37:47,170 --> 01:37:48,764
MATT: Make a medicine check.

1558
01:37:49,086 --> 01:37:51,627
LAURA: Can I take their helmets and put them in my
pink bag?

1559
01:37:51,627 --> 01:37:53,511
MATT: Sure, easy enough to do.

1560
01:37:53,511 --> 01:37:55,415
LAURA: What about their weapons? Do they have
any?

1561
01:37:55,415 --> 01:38:00,278
MATT: They do. They both are carrying a longsword.
They're well kept, not used. You look along the

1562
01:38:00,278 --> 01:38:03,395
blade and there are barely any signs of
indentation.

1563
01:38:03,395 --> 01:38:06,846
LAURA: Does it say anywhere "Property of the
Crownsguard?"

1564
01:38:06,846 --> 01:38:14,336
MATT: No, but they are uniform design. They're not
elaborate or ornamental. The Crownsguard weaponry

1565
01:38:14,336 --> 01:38:22,489
are all pretty much designed or provided by a
similar blacksmithy technique so they all feel

1566
01:38:22,489 --> 01:38:24,498
like they're uniform to a certain degree.

1567
01:38:24,498 --> 01:38:25,820
TRAVIS: Ten on the medicine check.

1568
01:38:25,820 --> 01:38:32,037
MATT: That's enough. It's not too hard to see. As
you look over each of the two bodies, both of them

1569
01:38:32,037 --> 01:38:37,583
have heavy puncture marks, either right in the
back of the neck on one of them, or the other one

1570
01:38:37,583 --> 01:38:43,347
has it right under the front of the chin. The
puncture marks are about that wide, about two

1571
01:38:43,347 --> 01:38:48,121
inches across on each side where the skin and
flesh has bubbled and pushed away from the side

1572
01:38:48,121 --> 01:38:50,889
and they go very deep in.

1573
01:38:50,889 --> 01:39:02,523
TRAVIS: So big fangs. Probably fucking pincers.
You know (clicking). Yeah. So watch your shit.

1574
01:39:08,793 --> 01:39:12,112
LIAM: Caleb stands still for a second and looks
around. Do I hear anything?

1575
01:39:12,291 --> 01:39:14,260
MATT: Make a perception check.

1576
01:39:14,260 --> 01:39:18,468
LIAM: Oh, in my sleeve. Oh, that's a one. So I
don't hear anything.

1577
01:39:18,468 --> 01:39:21,618
TRAVIS: How's the ground that we're standing on
now?

1578
01:39:21,618 --> 01:39:28,294
MATT: There would have been some general webbing
towards the base of this, but you've burned away

1579
01:39:28,294 --> 01:39:33,615
that central area. As you step forward, you look
beyond where that burning mark is and there is a

1580
01:39:33,615 --> 01:39:39,944
stark left turn. It curves to the left and looking
around the side it curves again to the right,

1581
01:39:39,944 --> 01:39:45,132
maybe 20 feet beyond that and you see another
webbing barrier where there looks to be three

1582
01:39:45,132 --> 01:39:49,284
different figures. You see now there is another
figure that is not part of the webbing barrier but

1583
01:39:49,284 --> 01:39:51,513
is just webbed to the wall right next to it.

1584
01:39:51,513 --> 01:39:53,160
TRAVIS: But the stone is unim--

1585
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:55,732
MATT: Unimpeded to the point it would be an
issue.

1586
01:39:55,732 --> 01:39:56,908
TRAVIS: Not tacky.

1587
01:39:56,908 --> 01:40:01,236
MATT: No, you feel a little bit of stickiness when
you step around from general fallen bits of stray

1588
01:40:01,236 --> 01:40:05,015
webbing strands and such, but nothing that would
impede your movement.

1589
01:40:05,015 --> 01:40:08,527
LAURA: How is it to try to chop through it with
the axe?

1590
01:40:08,527 --> 01:40:11,662
MATT: You can go try to either the one behind you
or the one ahead.

1591
01:40:11,662 --> 01:40:14,653
LAURA: Yeah, I want to try doing it and see if it
sticks to the weapon or if it cuts through.

1592
01:40:14,653 --> 01:40:15,780
MATT: To the one ahead?

1593
01:40:15,780 --> 01:40:16,647
LAURA: Yeah.

1594
01:40:16,647 --> 01:40:22,585
MATT: Okay. You come forth to the web there in
front of you to where the two other figures that

1595
01:40:22,762 --> 01:40:26,335
are massed there. They are both humanoid and you
now look over at a close glance as a third one,

1596
01:40:26,335 --> 01:40:29,844
small, looks to be another one of the rat
creatures that is caught in there. You carve

1597
01:40:29,844 --> 01:40:37,270
through. Go ahead and make an attack roll. Roll
damage for the handaxe.

1598
01:40:42,618 --> 01:40:44,312
LAURA: Seven.

1599
01:40:44,312 --> 01:40:51,110
MATT: Seven, okay. You carve through and a large
part tears through before your handaxe stops and

1600
01:40:51,110 --> 01:40:54,641
you're like (grunts) can't push any more. You try
and pull back and as you do, you pull your arm

1601
01:40:54,641 --> 01:40:58,361
back and it gets ripped from your grasp and it's
now stuck and folded, and your handaxe is now

1602
01:40:58,361 --> 01:41:00,087
wobbling in the web.

1603
01:41:00,087 --> 01:41:04,441
TALIESIN: I'm going to very gently cut her handaxe
out with my radiant sword.

1604
01:41:04,441 --> 01:41:08,151
MATT: Okay. You begin to carve around it and pull
it out, and you eventually get it free but now

1605
01:41:08,151 --> 01:41:13,717
there's a cluster of webbing around it almost like
the world's worst cotton candy. It's wrapped

1606
01:41:13,717 --> 01:41:16,414
around the center of it, but it's sticky.

1607
01:41:16,414 --> 01:41:17,771
TRAVIS: The worst kind of candy.

1608
01:41:17,771 --> 01:41:19,994
TALIESIN: Don't eat it!

1609
01:41:19,994 --> 01:41:24,595
LIAM: Jester, put it on the ground and take ten
steps back away from it.

1610
01:41:24,595 --> 01:41:26,230
LAURA: (metal plink)

1611
01:41:26,230 --> 01:41:29,852
MATT: (metal plinks) The metal hits the ground and
makes a bit of a sound.

1612
01:41:29,852 --> 01:41:32,400
LAURA: Except it's covered in webbing so not as
much sound.

1613
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:34,195
MATT: No, but the metal still hits the ground.

1614
01:41:35,027 --> 01:41:36,557
LIAM: (whoosh)

1615
01:41:36,557 --> 01:41:41,748
MATT: You watch as the flames burn around it and
free it. It lights up the vicinity a little bit.

1616
01:41:41,748 --> 01:41:45,817
There's that wedge opening where you've cut in
that webbing barrier and behind it you can see the

1617
01:41:45,817 --> 01:41:51,227
entire floor of the next portion appears to have
some sort of webbing layer around it and all the

1618
01:41:51,227 --> 01:41:58,471
walls are covered in it. Across the way you can
see rungs and the end of this portion of the

1619
01:41:58,471 --> 01:42:03,494
drainage that leads up into where you can see the
wind would be coming through, and that faint bit

1620
01:42:03,494 --> 01:42:06,808
of wind that's pushing through that's causing all
the webs to shift is coming from what you can

1621
01:42:06,808 --> 01:42:14,151
barely make out to be the faint bits of sunset
light peeking through another exit. A sewage exit

1622
01:42:14,151 --> 01:42:20,631
just like the one that you came in. You also see a
number of other figures that are all webbed to the

1623
01:42:20,631 --> 01:42:22,774
walls and encased within there.

1624
01:42:22,774 --> 01:42:27,211
TALIESIN: All of the ones webbed to the walls are
just as emaciated and dead?

1625
01:42:27,211 --> 01:42:28,870
MATT: Make a perception check.

1626
01:42:28,870 --> 01:42:30,223
LAURA: Can I get my handaxe back?

1627
01:42:30,223 --> 01:42:31,502
MATT: You can, yeah.

1628
01:42:31,502 --> 01:42:33,515
LAURA: Thanks, Caleb.

1629
01:42:33,515 --> 01:42:35,214
TALIESIN: Six.

1630
01:42:35,214 --> 01:42:39,207
MATT: You glance past in the distance. It's too
hard to see, unfortunately, because the torchlight

1631
01:42:39,207 --> 01:42:40,761
is too far away.

1632
01:42:40,761 --> 01:42:43,052
ASHLEY: How close are we to those now?

1633
01:42:43,052 --> 01:42:48,638
MATT: Well, you're at the second web wall. That's
about 25, 30 feet from you so it's beyond the

1634
01:42:48,638 --> 01:42:51,850
torchlight of where you're standing.

1635
01:42:51,850 --> 01:42:55,190
LAURA: It's a dead end past all of this? It's a
dead end and just goes up?

1636
01:42:55,190 --> 01:42:58,209
MATT: It looks like it. It goes to a dead end, but
it's all covered in webbing.

1637
01:42:58,209 --> 01:43:00,066
LAURA: It's got to be around here somewhere,
right?

1638
01:43:00,066 --> 01:43:02,226
ASHLEY: Or it's behind us and waiting until we get
in its room.

1639
01:43:02,226 --> 01:43:03,832
SAM: It's not behind us!

1640
01:43:03,832 --> 01:43:06,376
TALIESIN: I'm going to start trying to cut down,
find the points of the web wall where it's being

1641
01:43:06,376 --> 01:43:08,894
held together and cut any of the web.

1642
01:43:08,894 --> 01:43:10,635
SAM: Nothing back here!

1643
01:43:10,635 --> 01:43:13,841
MATT: Because of your rite, you manage to carve
through and you watch as the second web wall comes

1644
01:43:13,841 --> 01:43:21,312
and folds to the end. The bodies that are encased
in it hitting the ground with heavy thuds. You can

1645
01:43:21,312 --> 01:43:24,231
see the other bodies that are webbed to the walls
around. On the inside, you can see the end of

1646
01:43:24,231 --> 01:43:26,836
this. It is a giant web nest.

1647
01:43:30,106 --> 01:43:35,693
LIAM: If we deem it safe, maybe someone could look
out this other exit because, probably, something

1648
01:43:35,856 --> 01:43:41,381
is down here with us, but mayhaps above the grate,
this thing lives in a house perhaps. I don't know,

1649
01:43:41,381 --> 01:43:42,730
I'm spitballing.

1650
01:43:42,730 --> 01:43:46,629
TRAVIS: Or if we go up to the grate, and try and
get someone to open the hatch in case we need to

1651
01:43:46,629 --> 01:43:48,063
beat a speedy retreat.

1652
01:43:48,063 --> 01:43:49,881
LIAM: That is also good. That is two reasons to do
it.

1653
01:43:49,881 --> 01:43:50,788
LAURA: Should I go up?

1654
01:43:50,788 --> 01:43:51,575
TRAVIS: Yeah, do it.

1655
01:43:51,575 --> 01:43:52,500
LAURA: Okay.

1656
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:55,195
TRAVIS: Give her the writ of law thing.

1657
01:43:55,195 --> 01:44:01,785
LAURA: Is it blocked in and webby all along the
ground?

1658
01:44:01,785 --> 01:44:06,250
MATT: As you walk past, the ground itself is
sticky. You can still move, but you're hindered

1659
01:44:06,250 --> 01:44:11,623
somewhat having to like pull through and it tugs
at your feet. You guys watch as webbing tears and

1660
01:44:11,623 --> 01:44:14,503
builds on the bottom of her boots as she walks
in.

1661
01:44:14,503 --> 01:44:15,859
LAURA: I stop walking.

1662
01:44:15,859 --> 01:44:20,184
MATT: Okay. You stop and look and you can see the
faint outline of bodies that are webbed to the

1663
01:44:20,184 --> 01:44:26,352
wall. Parts of the faces that are revealed that
are gray and lifeless, drained. On the far wall,

1664
01:44:26,352 --> 01:44:32,448
you see a large cluster of webbing. It looks like
a mass of three or four bodies jammed together and

1665
01:44:32,448 --> 01:44:43,019
you see one body that's right next to where the
rungs are that is not as webbed as the others, and

1666
01:44:43,019 --> 01:44:51,277
there is color to the skin. You see elements of a
humanoid face. A halfling, it looks to be. About

1667
01:44:51,277 --> 01:44:54,555
halfling sized. It is about a foot up off the
ground, webbed to the wall, one arm is drifting

1668
01:44:54,555 --> 01:45:00,929
out and part of the face and unconscious, but is
not gray and dead like the others. And that's

1669
01:45:00,929 --> 01:45:02,339
where we're going to take a break.

1670
01:45:02,339 --> 01:45:04,799
SAM: Wait, no! But that's a person!

1671
01:45:04,799 --> 01:45:07,607
MATT: I know. We'll come back on that. It's
because I want to make sure we all get to the

1672
01:45:07,607 --> 01:45:12,725
bathroom, including myself. I have to pee like a
fucking racehorse. So yeah. We'll pick up on the

1673
01:45:12,725 --> 01:45:15,336
reveal of this non-dead body.

1674
01:45:15,336 --> 01:45:17,102
LAURA: I don't like it either.

1675
01:45:17,102 --> 01:45:19,678
ASHLEY: You went to no's like, "No no no."

1676
01:45:19,678 --> 01:45:24,136
MATT: We'll be back here in a few minutes. First
and foremost, we have our Wyrmwood giveaway, which

1677
01:45:24,136 --> 01:45:30,780
we've worked through some of the stuff. Yeah,
giveaways and laws are weird. I apologize for the

1678
01:45:30,931 --> 01:45:34,753
heads up, but as part of this Wyrmwood giveaway,
you need to be in the Twitch chat to participate.

1679
01:45:34,753 --> 01:45:37,718
I apologize.

1680
01:45:37,718 --> 01:45:40,195
ALL: I apologize.

1681
01:45:40,195 --> 01:45:44,516
MATT: We're fans of Deadwood, if you couldn't
tell. Right now, the offer is only for residents

1682
01:45:44,516 --> 01:45:49,350
of the United States and Canada, excluding Quebec,
because of laws. We're trying to figure out how to

1683
01:45:49,350 --> 01:45:51,914
expand that, but that's where we are at the
moment, so I apologize if you're not a part of

1684
01:45:51,914 --> 01:45:56,564
that. I'm so sorry. We have no way to get around
it, but we're working on it. For the official

1685
01:45:56,564 --> 01:46:00,952
rules, you can follow the link in chat. It should
be available to you. Tonight's prize is the Purple

1686
01:46:00,952 --> 01:46:07,127
Heart Adventurer's Arsenal, which you may
recognize as the wood that Scanlan had in the last

1687
01:46:07,127 --> 01:46:16,137
campaign. In case you haven't seen what these
arsenals are, it's a dice box as well as a great

1688
01:46:16,137 --> 01:46:20,192
interior. You can keep your dice, your pen, minis
or erasers, anything else you want to keep in

1689
01:46:20,192 --> 01:46:27,730
there. They're pretty badass. So we have that. The
contest has officially started, so all you have to

1690
01:46:27,730 --> 01:46:33,203
do is go into Twitch chat. Tonight's code is
sewers. The plural. Sewers.

1691
01:46:33,203 --> 01:46:35,052
TRAVIS: Is there an A in that?

1692
01:46:35,052 --> 01:46:41,585
MATT: No. But yes, that's the keyword. Only enter
it once in chat because entering it more than once

1693
01:46:41,585 --> 01:46:45,503
will disqualify you. Good luck, everyone. We'll
announce the winner when we come back from the

1694
01:46:45,503 --> 01:46:48,805
break. We'll be contacting the winners after the
break so make sure you keep an eye on your

1695
01:46:48,805 --> 01:46:53,989
whispers. We'll see you guys back here in a few
minutes.

1696
01:46:54,230 --> 02:01:37,373
[break]

1697
02:01:37,505 --> 02:01:42,512
MATT: And welcome back. First and foremost, we
know that some folks are having problems or issues

1698
02:01:42,512 --> 02:01:47,137
with the D&D Beyond discount code, which I think
was "InvisibleWand." They're working on it at D&D

1699
02:01:47,137 --> 02:01:52,914
Beyond, but don't worry, the code will be active
for a while. Look for updates or keep trying.

1700
02:01:52,914 --> 02:01:57,642
They're working on that. Also, we have our winner
of our fantastic Wyrmwood giveaway.

1701
02:01:57,642 --> 02:02:05,051
Congratulations to scopewar. Scopewar, you are the
winner. We'll get that out to you, so well done.

1702
02:02:05,051 --> 02:02:16,168
Bringing us back in. You guys had just noticed the
furthest element of this segment of the sewer,

1703
02:02:16,168 --> 02:02:22,085
where the webbing had become far more apparent.
You had discovered a few bodies that came over.

1704
02:02:22,085 --> 02:02:27,129
You had carved through one wall and caused that to
fall off to the side, and leading to the very end

1705
02:02:27,129 --> 02:02:32,697
of it, you saw an ascension that went to another
exit grate into the city. A number of bodies, one

1706
02:02:32,697 --> 02:02:38,700
large webbed mass of a few bodies and one
individual that looked to be still alive, though

1707
02:02:38,700 --> 02:02:41,775
unconscious and webbed against the wall.

1708
02:02:41,775 --> 02:02:44,516
LAURA: Is he reachable?

1709
02:02:44,516 --> 02:02:47,578
MATT: From you right now, he's about 20 feet ahead
of you.

1710
02:02:47,578 --> 02:02:53,567
LAURA: (whispered) He's still 20 feet away from
me. You guys! Hey fuckers!

1711
02:02:53,567 --> 02:02:54,774
MARISHA: What?!

1712
02:02:54,774 --> 02:03:02,084
LAURA: I'm a little worried about walking any
further because my feet are starting to stick to

1713
02:03:02,084 --> 02:03:09,836
the ground, like a lot. But there's a halfling
stuck to the wall over here and I don't think he's

1714
02:03:09,836 --> 02:03:11,267
dead.

1715
02:03:11,267 --> 02:03:16,466
MARISHA: Okay. You stay there with the halfling. I
might be able to negotiate my way a little

1716
02:03:16,466 --> 02:03:17,267
further.

1717
02:03:17,267 --> 02:03:19,193
LIAM: Is Jester right up with the halfling?

1718
02:03:19,193 --> 02:03:21,281
LAURA: No, I'm 20 feet away from it.

1719
02:03:21,281 --> 02:03:25,033
TRAVIS: If you had to ballpark the distance to the
halfling or to the very end of it?

1720
02:03:25,033 --> 02:03:32,396
MATT: From you guys all together, it's about 25
feet, 30 feet. Jester is a little bit closer.

1721
02:03:32,967 --> 02:03:35,719
SAM: All clear in the back!

1722
02:03:35,719 --> 02:03:37,898
TALIESIN: I'd forgotten.

1723
02:03:37,898 --> 02:03:44,928
TRAVIS: I am going to join Nott at the back and
keep an eye on the rear.

1724
02:03:44,928 --> 02:03:46,742
SAM: No need!

1725
02:03:46,742 --> 02:03:48,851
MATT: Make a perception check.

1726
02:03:52,831 --> 02:03:54,533
MARISHA: Oh, jeez Louise.

1727
02:03:54,623 --> 02:03:55,646
TRAVIS: Ten.

1728
02:03:55,646 --> 02:04:00,624
MATT: Okay, Fjord you shift around to join Nott in
the back and you guys look off in that distance.

1729
02:04:00,624 --> 02:04:04,414
You see nothing in the darkness behind you. Who
else is doing what?

1730
02:04:04,414 --> 02:04:10,029
LIAM: I am going to walk up to Jester and stand
next to her and then I am going to send Schmidt

1731
02:04:10,029 --> 02:04:18,783
forward to this halfling to try to maybe lift up
his, its, I can't tell you. The chin of this halfling.

1732
02:04:18,783 --> 02:04:21,034
MARISHA: I'm going to also move forward next to
Caleb.

1733
02:04:21,164 --> 02:04:25,730
MATT: You move forward next to Caleb as well. You
guys are finding your feet sticking to the

1734
02:04:25,730 --> 02:04:34,538
material of the floor webbing. You approach. You
watch as the head of this halfling is pulled away

1735
02:04:34,538 --> 02:04:42,872
from some of the webbing and lifted up. It is
male. Actually, because you're still with Yasha in

1736
02:04:42,872 --> 02:04:48,315
the back, make a perception check both of you.

1737
02:04:48,315 --> 02:04:50,088
LIAM: Well if I can't see--

1738
02:04:50,088 --> 02:04:52,829
MATT: It's low light beyond that so make a
perception check with disadvantage.

1739
02:04:52,829 --> 02:04:54,690
MARISHA: I've got dope goggles, though.

1740
02:04:54,690 --> 02:04:56,494
LIAM: Oh, well okay.

1741
02:04:56,494 --> 02:04:58,171
MATT: You can make a straight perception check if
you'd like.

1742
02:04:58,171 --> 02:05:01,100
LIAM: Well I would say if I can't see, if I knew I
can't see, if I were really in this place instead

1743
02:05:01,100 --> 02:05:02,405
of sitting as this table.

1744
02:05:02,405 --> 02:05:04,667
MATT: You can if Yasha comes closer, but Yasha has
the only source of light.

1745
02:05:04,667 --> 02:05:08,166
LIAM: If I couldn't see coming up, I would go
(poofing) and send out Dancing Lights.

1746
02:05:08,453 --> 02:05:09,751
MARISHA: Natural 20.

1747
02:05:09,751 --> 02:05:11,298
LIAM: There you go.

1748
02:05:11,298 --> 02:05:17,571
MATT: The Dancing Lights appear in the air and
begin to drift in help fill out the area, your

1749
02:05:17,571 --> 02:05:22,187
torch light still being this larger beacon of
flame light in the space. Beau, you glance ahead

1750
02:05:22,187 --> 02:05:26,374
and can see as the chin is lifted, a thick band of
tattoos--

1751
02:05:26,374 --> 02:05:33,380
MARISHA: I think these goggles are like polarized.
It's real cool. He's got a thick band of tattoos, sorry.

1752
02:05:33,484 --> 02:05:38,153
MATT: A thick band of tattoos that completely
encompasses the neck to the point where what's

1753
02:05:38,153 --> 02:05:42,561
exposed from beneath it's like black shapes and
designs completely around.

1754
02:05:42,561 --> 02:05:43,839
MARISHA: Of the halfling?

1755
02:05:43,839 --> 02:05:45,645
MATT: Of the halfling, yeah.

1756
02:05:45,645 --> 02:05:49,469
MARISHA: Do they look old or like a fresher
tattoo?

1757
02:05:49,469 --> 02:05:50,706
MATT: Did you roll a natural 20?

1758
02:05:50,706 --> 02:05:52,100
MARISHA: I did roll a natural 20.

1759
02:05:52,100 --> 02:05:59,042
MATT: Your amazing monk-like sight, they're not
fresh.

1760
02:05:59,042 --> 02:06:00,942
MARISHA: They're not fresh.

1761
02:06:00,942 --> 02:06:02,872
MATT: They're not fresh.

1762
02:06:02,872 --> 02:06:05,329
MARISHA: Do I see puncture wounds?

1763
02:06:05,513 --> 02:06:06,833
MATT: You do not.

1764
02:06:06,833 --> 02:06:08,698
MARISHA: Okay.

1765
02:06:08,698 --> 02:06:18,476
MATT: Also, there's this weird sense that creeps
on Nott and Fjord as you're glancing forward and

1766
02:06:18,476 --> 02:06:33,575
you both turn over your shoulder to see a massive
pale white and blue arachnid creature, legs

1767
02:06:33,575 --> 02:06:40,924
spindling outward, at a width of ten feet or more.
Giant dripping fangs and beady red eyes, a row of

1768
02:06:40,924 --> 02:06:45,464
them glaring right at you as this (hiss) pincers
open up.

1769
02:06:45,464 --> 02:06:47,554
LAURA: How close is it to you guys?

1770
02:06:47,554 --> 02:06:52,446
MATT: It's right behind Fjord and Nott and it is
striking you, Fjord, as its first strike.

1771
02:06:52,446 --> 02:06:54,384
SAM: It snuck up on us?

1772
02:06:54,384 --> 02:06:55,966
ASHLEY: Wait, so it's behind?

1773
02:06:55,966 --> 02:06:58,475
MATT: It's literally here!

1774
02:06:58,475 --> 02:07:01,000
ALL: Oh!

1775
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:02,895
ASHLEY: Was it on the ceiling the whole time?

1776
02:07:02,895 --> 02:07:07,467
MATT: That is going to be a 23 to hit.

1777
02:07:09,317 --> 02:07:12,024
TRAVIS: Against my 14? Yeah!

1778
02:07:12,135 --> 02:07:16,782
LIAM: While this death is happening, Caleb is
Schmidt go like this to the halfling. Caleb's

1779
02:07:16,782 --> 02:07:19,944
going, "Hey guy, hey hey hey."

1780
02:07:19,944 --> 02:07:21,487
MARISHA: Halfling!

1781
02:07:21,487 --> 02:07:29,872
MATT: You suffer seven points of piercing damage,
as its fangs snap right into your chest area. Do

1782
02:07:29,872 --> 02:07:31,058
you still have ice armor on?

1783
02:07:31,058 --> 02:07:35,409
TRAVIS: I do, so he takes ten points of damage.
The armor is gone.

1784
02:07:35,409 --> 02:07:38,940
MATT: I also need you to make a constitution
saving throw.

1785
02:07:38,940 --> 02:07:40,393
LAURA: Oh no!

1786
02:07:40,393 --> 02:07:43,597
TRAVIS: Shit! 17.

1787
02:07:43,597 --> 02:07:50,425
MATT: You feel venom pulse into your body. Your
physicality, however, being somewhat sturdy,

1788
02:07:50,425 --> 02:07:56,164
manages to resist a large element of the poison
that is suddenly thrust into your torso. You

1789
02:07:56,164 --> 02:08:07,146
take-- that's a terrible roll. You take five
points of poison damage. Nott, you look up and see

1790
02:08:07,146 --> 02:08:17,385
this thing as it digs its giant pincers and fangs
into Fjord's body and it pulls back and you watch

1791
02:08:17,385 --> 02:08:20,158
it vanish and disappear.

1792
02:08:20,158 --> 02:08:21,370
TRAVIS: Fuck!

1793
02:08:21,370 --> 02:08:22,794
MATT: I need you all to roll initiative.

1794
02:08:22,794 --> 02:08:26,284
LAURA: It's an invisible spider!

1795
02:08:26,284 --> 02:08:33,146
TALIESIN: To be fair, invisible spiders are the
best spiders because you can't-- hey, look at that!

1796
02:08:34,302 --> 02:08:36,737
TRAVIS: Oh, look at the webs!

1797
02:08:37,657 --> 02:08:40,272
MARISHA: Why are we invisible? Oh.

1798
02:08:40,364 --> 02:08:47,120
LAURA: We're not invisible, those are dead people!
I see dead people.

1799
02:08:47,120 --> 02:08:51,923
TRAVIS: Invisible shit ass bitch! Nipples on a
horse!

1800
02:08:51,923 --> 02:08:54,538
MATT: The last place you saw this--

1801
02:08:54,633 --> 02:08:57,042
ASHLEY: Are they invisible, the people that are on the walls?

1802
02:08:57,159 --> 02:09:01,015
MATT: The last place you saw it was there before
it disappeared.

1803
02:09:01,015 --> 02:09:04,015
ALL: Fuck!

1804
02:09:04,025 --> 02:09:06,891
LAURA: Where before it disappeared?

1805
02:09:06,965 --> 02:09:08,183
MATT: Right there.

1806
02:09:08,183 --> 02:09:10,387
LAURA: Wait, why are all the other things
invisible? Does that mean those are other things

1807
02:09:10,387 --> 02:09:11,885
that are going to attack us?

1808
02:09:11,885 --> 02:09:20,679
MATT: These are all the bodies that have been
webbed up. Initiative order for you guys, please.

1809
02:09:20,679 --> 02:09:22,424
25 to 20.

1810
02:09:22,424 --> 02:09:23,772
LAURA: 22!

1811
02:09:23,772 --> 02:09:25,543
MATT: Nice!

1812
02:09:26,796 --> 02:09:30,209
MARISHA: Oh goddamn it, he has it this whole
time.

1813
02:09:30,499 --> 02:09:34,175
MATT: All right, Jester's up front at 22. 20 to
15, guys.

1814
02:09:34,175 --> 02:09:36,013
LIAM: 15! Fünfzehn.

1815
02:09:36,013 --> 02:09:39,739
TRAVIS: I have 15, as well. Nobody has higher than
a 15?

1816
02:09:39,739 --> 02:09:41,637
LAURA: I had a 22.

1817
02:09:41,637 --> 02:09:43,632
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean besides Jester.

1818
02:09:43,632 --> 02:09:52,705
MATT: All righty, that was ten to 15? Ten to
five.

1819
02:09:52,705 --> 02:09:58,548
MARISHA: I'm sorry. Then ten to 15. I'm 13.

1820
02:09:58,548 --> 02:10:00,227
TALIESIN: I'm 13.

1821
02:10:00,227 --> 02:10:02,236
TRAVIS: You're both 13?

1822
02:10:02,236 --> 02:10:05,562
MATT: Beau and Molly. All righty, and ten to
five?

1823
02:10:05,562 --> 02:10:07,711
ASHLEY: Eight! Oh, seven, I'm sorry.

1824
02:10:07,711 --> 02:10:09,442
SAM: Five!

1825
02:10:09,442 --> 02:10:11,323
TRAVIS: Good, separated from everybody.

1826
02:10:11,323 --> 02:10:12,961
LAURA: Man, you always have the shittiest
initiative!

1827
02:10:12,961 --> 02:10:14,339
ASHLEY: So do I.

1828
02:10:14,339 --> 02:10:16,249
LAURA: Yeah, why do you guys always have bad
initiative?

1829
02:10:16,249 --> 02:10:17,923
SAM: Because we save it for when it really
counts!

1830
02:10:17,923 --> 02:10:18,746
MATT: That's true.

1831
02:10:18,746 --> 02:10:19,800
LAURA: Weird.

1832
02:10:19,800 --> 02:10:22,229
MATT: The top of this round. Jester, you're up
first.

1833
02:10:22,229 --> 02:10:27,071
LAURA: I'm up first! Okay, did I hear it happen to
Fjord? Did I hear anything?

1834
02:10:27,071 --> 02:10:32,715
MATT: No. Well, you hear like the reaction of
pain, and you glance over just in time to see this

1835
02:10:32,715 --> 02:10:36,531
large, monstrous spider body vanish in place.

1836
02:10:36,531 --> 02:10:38,327
LAURA: Oh no!

1837
02:10:38,327 --> 02:10:40,184
SAM: I'm probably screaming.

1838
02:10:40,184 --> 02:10:41,796
MATT: Nott is just--

1839
02:10:41,796 --> 02:10:45,557
SAM: (screaming)

1840
02:10:45,870 --> 02:10:56,996
LAURA: I cast Spiritual Weapon, a giant purple
lollipop! Oh no. I've got some, but you have one

1841
02:10:56,996 --> 02:10:58,546
too, don't you?

1842
02:10:58,546 --> 02:11:00,219
TALIESIN: We have a couple around.

1843
02:11:00,219 --> 02:11:01,226
MATT: Oh, do you have one there?

1844
02:11:01,226 --> 02:11:03,085
LAURA: No, you have the one. Don't you have the
one?

1845
02:11:03,085 --> 02:11:04,627
SAM: You have a one with the stand.

1846
02:11:04,627 --> 02:11:05,829
LAURA: That Brittany made?

1847
02:11:05,829 --> 02:11:12,133
MATT: Yes, but it appears to have been moved since
they used the table last time. Oh well.

1848
02:11:12,133 --> 02:11:14,496
LAURA: Somebody took a picture of it then
disappeared it?

1849
02:11:14,496 --> 02:11:16,040
MATT: It might have happened, yeah.

1850
02:11:16,040 --> 02:11:19,488
LAURA: I make a giant teal lollipop instead! Here
you go.

1851
02:11:19,488 --> 02:11:25,544
MATT: Where shall we place this?

1852
02:11:25,544 --> 02:11:28,910
LAURA: Directly overhead of where the spider
disappeared.

1853
02:11:28,910 --> 02:11:35,189
MATT: Okay, we'll put it there. It worries me that
I get to unveil that and it's not around.

1854
02:11:35,189 --> 02:11:39,529
MARISHA: Does anyone know where the lollipop is?

1855
02:11:39,529 --> 02:11:44,155
MATT: It's fine. Jester, you use that as your
bonus action to cast. What are you using your

1856
02:11:44,200 --> 02:11:45,551
action for?

1857
02:11:45,551 --> 02:12:02,102
LAURA: I'm going to, oh god, cast Sacred Flame on
the place that it was at. Can I do that?

1858
02:12:02,102 --> 02:12:03,844
MATT: Sacred Flame is a cantrip?

1859
02:12:03,844 --> 02:12:04,783
LAURA: Yeah.

1860
02:12:04,783 --> 02:12:05,952
MATT: You can, sure.

1861
02:12:05,952 --> 02:12:07,865
LAURA: On the place that I saw it.

1862
02:12:07,865 --> 02:12:13,263
MATT: Okay, you watch as the large lollipop
apparates in that space and you cast Sacred Flame.

1863
02:12:13,263 --> 02:12:15,702
It has no target to effect.

1864
02:12:15,702 --> 02:12:20,896
LAURA: It's not invisible guys, it's gone.

1865
02:12:21,946 --> 02:12:23,905
TRAVIS: Nothing happens?

1866
02:12:24,037 --> 02:12:28,366
MATT: No, there's no burst of flame. The spell has
no target.

1867
02:12:28,366 --> 02:12:34,895
LAURA: I'm going to back up against-- oh no, if I
back against a wall, it's sticky, isn't it?

1868
02:12:34,895 --> 02:12:40,259
MATT: The space, all this area here, where the
webbing starts is considered rough terrain to move

1869
02:12:40,259 --> 02:12:44,495
through. So your speed is halved moving through
that area.

1870
02:12:46,215 --> 02:12:54,500
LAURA: I'm going to take a couple steps, if I can,
like up on those rocks next to Yasha is it? Yeah.

1871
02:12:55,044 --> 02:12:56,870
TALIESIN: We should probably clump together.

1872
02:12:56,870 --> 02:12:59,716
MATT: Okay. So you back up onto the rocks and
start pulling your feet out of the webbing as you

1873
02:12:59,716 --> 02:13:05,149
do. That ends your turn?

1874
02:13:05,570 --> 02:13:06,607
LAURA: Yes.

1875
02:13:06,607 --> 02:13:10,279
MATT: Ending Jester's turn. Caleb and Fjord, you
guys are up.

1876
02:13:10,279 --> 02:13:17,966
LIAM: Can I get either inside or behind that crate
that's in the corner with difficult terrain?

1877
02:13:17,966 --> 02:13:28,188
MATT: I can say you can start to get into it. It
doesn't offer you any cover at the moment, but

1878
02:13:28,188 --> 02:13:30,930
you're in it right now.

1879
02:13:30,930 --> 02:13:38,302
LIAM: Okay, for an action, I am going to cast the
Blur spell on myself again und I will use my

1880
02:13:38,302 --> 02:13:43,950
bonus action to have Schmidt come. I'm assuming
he's not affected by webs?

1881
02:13:43,950 --> 02:13:46,034
MATT: He doesn't seem to be.

1882
02:13:46,034 --> 02:13:49,269
LIAM: Well then I will summon him to stand above
me on the box.

1883
02:13:49,269 --> 02:13:51,602
MATT: Okay.

1884
02:13:51,602 --> 02:13:56,410
CALEB: So I'm blurry and there's an invisible guy
right above me.

1885
02:13:56,410 --> 02:14:00,990
MATT: Ending Caleb's turn. You are currently
blurring and shifting.

1886
02:14:00,990 --> 02:14:08,359
TRAVIS: Okay, can I spin back after getting
fucking bit by a goddamn spider, and can I back up--

1887
02:14:08,359 --> 02:14:13,872
10, 15, 20. Does that cause anything to hit me?

1888
02:14:13,953 --> 02:14:15,216
MATT: Nope.

1889
02:14:15,216 --> 02:14:17,514
TRAVIS: Cool. I don't see nothing, right?

1890
02:14:17,514 --> 02:14:19,302
MATT: Currently, no.

1891
02:14:19,302 --> 02:14:24,231
TRAVIS: Nice. Can I fire Eldritch Blast in the
direction that I saw it?

1892
02:14:24,231 --> 02:14:25,527
MATT: You can.

1893
02:14:25,527 --> 02:14:26,476
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1894
02:14:26,476 --> 02:14:27,997
MATT: Make a main attack roll.

1895
02:14:28,932 --> 02:14:30,444
TRAVIS: 17.

1896
02:14:30,444 --> 02:14:34,308
MATT: (poof) It hits the stone wall behind it.
It's not there.

1897
02:14:34,308 --> 02:14:36,275
TRAVIS: It moved!

1898
02:14:36,275 --> 02:14:38,750
(laughter)

1899
02:14:38,750 --> 02:14:42,312
MATT: You get the sense that it's not apparently
there.

1900
02:14:42,312 --> 02:14:45,205
TRAVIS: I need to see it to do anything else. All
right.

1901
02:14:45,205 --> 02:14:50,537
MATT: That ends your turn. That brings us to-- all
right. So--

1902
02:14:53,845 --> 02:14:56,425
MARISHA: The spider is in between Fjord and Beau.

1903
02:14:56,567 --> 02:15:03,197
LAURA: The spider is in between Fjord and Beau. I
thought Travis would make the note, but he's not.

1904
02:15:03,197 --> 02:15:04,579
SAM: He's busy.

1905
02:15:04,579 --> 02:15:10,210
MATT: There is a moment, Fjord, as you back up
after releasing your Eldritch Blast where it

1906
02:15:10,210 --> 02:15:17,824
impacts the wall and you're like, "Shit." You hear
this (whoosh) sound and look your right and it

1907
02:15:17,824 --> 02:15:21,118
appears right next to you.

1908
02:15:21,118 --> 02:15:22,298
LAURA: Where?

1909
02:15:22,298 --> 02:15:24,872
TRAVIS: Oh fuck!

1910
02:15:25,588 --> 02:15:27,865
ASHLEY: Well, he's not invisible anymore.

1911
02:15:27,865 --> 02:15:30,716
MATT: It lunges out towards you again.

1912
02:15:30,803 --> 02:15:32,053
TRAVIS: Oh, no.

1913
02:15:34,916 --> 02:15:40,188
Shit, that's another 23. Two 19s in a row.

1914
02:15:40,188 --> 02:15:43,339
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean, you don't need me to tell
you it hits.

1915
02:15:43,339 --> 02:15:47,299
MATT: That is eight points of piercing damage, and
I need you to make a constitution saving throw.

1916
02:15:47,299 --> 02:15:48,667
TRAVIS: Damn!

1917
02:15:48,667 --> 02:15:50,929
MARISHA: How many?

1918
02:15:54,629 --> 02:15:56,880
TRAVIS: Okay, constitution saving throw.

1919
02:15:57,854 --> 02:15:59,797
Oh, that's an eight.

1920
02:16:01,373 --> 02:16:03,026
TALIESIN: That's a lot of dice.

1921
02:16:03,026 --> 02:16:06,314
MATT: All right, you take 15 points of poison
damage.

1922
02:16:06,314 --> 02:16:09,072
SAM: That's all of the poison damage.

1923
02:16:09,072 --> 02:16:17,038
TRAVIS: I'm unconscious. No! Relentl--
The thing, I got the thing! It's called Relentless

1924
02:16:17,038 --> 02:16:19,772
Endurance! I come back to one hit point!

1925
02:16:19,883 --> 02:16:21,565
LAURA: It's Relentless!

1926
02:16:21,565 --> 02:16:23,542
TRAVIS: Sorry, I'm half dead.

1927
02:16:23,542 --> 02:16:27,608
MATT: As the fangs dig into the side of your
torso, you pull back and try and defend yourself

1928
02:16:27,608 --> 02:16:32,735
and it pierces your leather armor in your torso.
It releases a huge burst of venom into your chest.

1929
02:16:32,735 --> 02:16:38,293
You feel your lungs and heart seize for a moment
and you almost fall back. That burning orcish rage

1930
02:16:38,293 --> 02:16:42,423
from underneath gives you that last bit of
inspiration to shrug off the poison and look back

1931
02:16:42,423 --> 02:16:45,024
angrily and realize you are in deep shit.

1932
02:16:45,024 --> 02:16:46,136
TRAVIS: Oh fuck.

1933
02:16:46,136 --> 02:16:49,401
LIAM: There you go, Freemasons. He's actually a
half orc.

1934
02:16:50,859 --> 02:16:58,403
MATT: All righty, that ends its turn. That brings
us to Beau and Molly.

1935
02:16:58,403 --> 02:17:00,533
MARISHA: Do you want to go first?

1936
02:17:00,533 --> 02:17:02,073
TALIESIN: You can go first.

1937
02:17:02,073 --> 02:17:07,158
MARISHA: Is there a way I can hop over the web
situation?

1938
02:17:07,158 --> 02:17:08,534
MATT: Is it bothering you?

1939
02:17:08,534 --> 02:17:09,509
LAURA: Yes!

1940
02:17:09,509 --> 02:17:11,232
MATT: It's been bothering you this whole time?

1941
02:17:11,232 --> 02:17:13,474
MARISHA: It was bothering me this whole time, too!
I meant to fix it in the break.

1942
02:17:13,474 --> 02:17:15,557
MATT: Laura Bailey, the kind of friend that tells
you when you have a booger in your nose. I really

1943
02:17:15,557 --> 02:17:16,739
appreciate it.

1944
02:17:16,825 --> 02:17:21,160
MARISHA: Can I jump this gap where Molly is and
avoid the webbing?

1945
02:17:21,160 --> 02:17:30,887
MATT: You can certainly try. Go ahead and make an
athletics check. You are standing in webbing, so

1946
02:17:30,887 --> 02:17:32,255
it's being able to--

1947
02:17:32,255 --> 02:17:33,808
MARISHA: Natural 20.

1948
02:17:33,808 --> 02:17:37,896
MATT: I will say yes! I will give you the ability
to leap through and land off to this side using

1949
02:17:37,896 --> 02:17:42,780
your movement and avoid that ten feet and still
manage to free yourself from the webbing. So that

1950
02:17:42,780 --> 02:17:47,286
was 15 feet of your movement used to leap.

1951
02:17:47,286 --> 02:17:48,577
MARISHA: So I have 25 more feet?

1952
02:17:48,577 --> 02:17:49,463
MATT: Yep.

1953
02:17:49,463 --> 02:17:51,989
MARISHA: How close can I get to the spider?

1954
02:17:51,989 --> 02:17:53,258
MATT: Let's give it a shot.

1955
02:17:53,258 --> 02:17:56,431
LIAM: I mean, Beau is pretty fucking amazing in
combat.

1956
02:17:58,161 --> 02:18:01,646
MATT: 25! You're not quite close enough.

1957
02:18:01,747 --> 02:18:03,197
MARISHA: Fuck!

1958
02:18:03,197 --> 02:18:07,012
I don't have any reach with my stick.

1959
02:18:07,012 --> 02:18:13,703
MATT: No, you have whatever monk abilities that
you have. You have eyes on it at the moment, yes.

1960
02:18:13,703 --> 02:18:21,158
MARISHA: I will hold. I will take a dodge action.

1961
02:18:21,158 --> 02:18:28,306
MATT: You start defending yourself, preparing for
its onslaught. That brings me to Molly's turn.

1962
02:18:28,455 --> 02:18:35,787
TALIESIN: I'm going to head towards the spider, as
close as I can get. There's not a lot I can do.

1963
02:18:35,787 --> 02:18:38,223
MATT: You're right there.

1964
02:18:38,223 --> 02:18:42,701
TALIESIN: I'm going to use Devil's Tongue, I'm
going to use Vicious Mockery.

1965
02:18:46,961 --> 02:18:49,179
MATT: It rolls a natural 19 on its saving throw.

1966
02:18:49,761 --> 02:18:52,135
TALIESIN: (guttural Infernal sounds)

1967
02:18:52,135 --> 02:18:54,198
MATT: That's like three 19s in a row that it has
rolled, by the way.

1968
02:18:54,198 --> 02:18:56,065
LAURA: You have something in your throat, Molly.

1969
02:18:56,065 --> 02:18:58,432
TRAVIS: What dice are you using?

1970
02:18:58,432 --> 02:19:01,505
MATT: Well, the last two I was using the Golden
Snitch. This one I used the black d20.

1971
02:19:01,625 --> 02:19:04,175
SAM: We are all going to die because of the Golden
Snitch.

1972
02:19:04,175 --> 02:19:06,957
MATT: It was gifted to me at the end of the last
campaign.

1973
02:19:06,957 --> 02:19:08,770
TALIESIN: It was gifted.

1974
02:19:08,770 --> 02:19:11,826
LAURA: Or did you throw it on the table and Matt
snatched it up?

1975
02:19:11,826 --> 02:19:14,856
TALIESIN: We are golden gods.

1976
02:19:14,856 --> 02:19:17,600
MATT: You must invite the vampire in for it to
cross the threshold.

1977
02:19:17,600 --> 02:19:20,830
(laughter)

1978
02:19:20,830 --> 02:19:22,637
TALIESIN: I have made a terrible mistake.

1979
02:19:22,715 --> 02:19:25,610
MATT: So, Molly, you moved up there and you're
still ten feet away from this creature.

1980
02:19:25,610 --> 02:19:31,694
TALIESIN: I'm just going to hold.

1981
02:19:31,694 --> 02:19:33,543
MATT: All right, so you're holding--?

1982
02:19:33,543 --> 02:19:35,574
TALIESIN: An attack for the second that it's
within range.

1983
02:19:35,574 --> 02:19:38,899
MATT: Okay, so you're holding your action in case
it shows up within range to strike it. Okay, good

1984
02:19:38,899 --> 02:19:41,765
to know. That finishes their turn. Yasha, you're
up.

1985
02:19:41,765 --> 02:19:44,847
ASHLEY: Okay, can I get to it?

1986
02:19:44,847 --> 02:19:46,353
MATT: What's your speed?

1987
02:19:46,353 --> 02:19:47,562
ASHLEY: 30 feet.

1988
02:19:47,562 --> 02:19:56,255
MATT: 30 feet? (counting) Just in range!

1989
02:19:56,255 --> 02:19:58,797
ASHLEY: Okay, so. Um--

1990
02:19:58,797 --> 02:20:00,813
I would like to rage.

1991
02:20:00,813 --> 02:20:02,879
(cheering)

1992
02:20:02,994 --> 02:20:05,993
ASHLEY: Okay, so I would like to rage, and then--

1993
02:20:05,993 --> 02:20:12,653
MATT: It spins around after Molly screamed at it,
and it goes (snarling). You can see in your torch

1994
02:20:12,653 --> 02:20:16,064
light, as you're clutching it in your hand as you
rush towards it. You're going to have to drop that

1995
02:20:16,064 --> 02:20:17,330
torch to grab your two-handed weapon.

1996
02:20:17,330 --> 02:20:18,129
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1997
02:20:18,129 --> 02:20:22,159
MATT: You drop it on the ground, and as it hits
the ground, the light flickers off of its eight

1998
02:20:22,159 --> 02:20:27,185
red beady eyes. It turns, its fangs open towards
you and you see the venom and bits of Fjord blood

1999
02:20:27,185 --> 02:20:31,522
dripping off of the end of it as you rush towards
it. All right, you rage, what are you doing?

2000
02:20:31,522 --> 02:20:36,034
ASHLEY: Rage, take out my sword and try to hit it
between the eyes.

2001
02:20:36,034 --> 02:20:37,935
MATT: Go for it, roll for attack.

2002
02:20:37,935 --> 02:20:39,073
ASHLEY: Okay.

2003
02:20:42,992 --> 02:20:43,922
Okay.

2004
02:20:47,092 --> 02:20:47,930
23.

2005
02:20:48,223 --> 02:20:50,092
MATT: 23 hits! Roll damage.

2006
02:20:53,292 --> 02:20:54,976
ASHLEY: What do I roll?!

2007
02:20:55,059 --> 02:20:58,928
MATT: It's d12 for your greatsword. Plus whatever
your strength--

2008
02:20:58,928 --> 02:21:01,606
ASHLEY: 2d6 plus three.

2009
02:21:01,606 --> 02:21:06,293
MATT: Oh the greatsword yeah, d12 is greataxe.
2d6, plus three, plus whatever your rage damage

2010
02:21:06,293 --> 02:21:08,684
bonus is, which I think is two, right?

2011
02:21:08,684 --> 02:21:10,129
ASHLEY: (grunting)

2012
02:21:11,036 --> 02:21:12,375
LIAM: It's like an airplane.

2013
02:21:12,375 --> 02:21:14,164
TRAVIS: Yeah, this is the second fight.

2014
02:21:14,164 --> 02:21:16,550
TALIESIN: It might auto if you select your--

2015
02:21:16,550 --> 02:21:18,580
LAURA: Yeah, she didn't get a session zero.

2016
02:21:18,580 --> 02:21:21,238
MATT: Yeah, it's plus two. It's plus five damage
to whatever you roll.

2017
02:21:22,968 --> 02:21:24,160
LAURA: Yeah!

2018
02:21:24,654 --> 02:21:26,148
ASHLEY: Plus five to whatever I roll?

2019
02:21:26,148 --> 02:21:26,863
MATT: Yep.

2020
02:21:26,863 --> 02:21:28,467
ASHLEY: Okay, 14.

2021
02:21:28,467 --> 02:21:30,701
MATT: 14 points of slashing damage.

2022
02:21:30,949 --> 02:21:32,275
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah, beast mode.

2023
02:21:32,275 --> 02:21:33,900
As you rush towards it with a large arc, 
slamming down like

2024
02:21:33,900 --> 02:21:41,158
(whoosh), you carve through part of its carapace,
two of the eyes are cloven through and are now

2025
02:21:41,158 --> 02:21:42,501
bloodied and ruined.

2026
02:21:42,501 --> 02:21:43,606
LAURA: It's blinded!

2027
02:21:43,606 --> 02:21:50,075
MATT: It shrieks back. It's hurt, but it's still
doing fine. Is that the end of your turn?

2028
02:21:50,075 --> 02:21:53,192
ASHLEY: Yeah, because I can't do anything else,
right?

2029
02:21:53,192 --> 02:21:53,904
MATT: Yeah.

2030
02:21:53,904 --> 02:21:55,682
ASHLEY: Okay, I stand there at the ready with the
point.

2031
02:21:55,682 --> 02:21:57,128
MATT: Got it. Nott, you're up.

2032
02:21:57,128 --> 02:22:09,483
SAM: Okay. I'm going to shout out: I think this is
the monster! I will nervously fire my hand

2033
02:22:09,483 --> 02:22:18,225
crossbow at the beast, hoping not to hit any of my
friends. 12 plus something? Six. 18.

2034
02:22:18,225 --> 02:22:20,927
MATT: That hits. Roll damage. You get sneak
attack.

2035
02:22:20,927 --> 02:22:33,114
SAM: Yeah. (counting) 14. Plus Fury of the Small,
17 points.

2036
02:22:33,114 --> 02:22:35,873
(cheering)

2037
02:22:35,873 --> 02:22:44,641
MATT: As it opens its mouth, the firelight from
the torch flickering in, its horrible weirdly

2038
02:22:44,641 --> 02:22:50,249
shaped spider-like mutated mouth open up where the
pincers and the giant fangs are. A bolt sinks into

2039
02:22:50,249 --> 02:22:57,070
its throat, and it starts shrieking, backing up
defensively, the pain causing it to pull away from

2040
02:22:57,070 --> 02:23:00,146
you. That's a serious amount of damage.

2041
02:23:00,146 --> 02:23:12,017
SAM: Yeah. I scramble away in Caleb's direction,
and that cocoon guy there. I'm going to hide right

2042
02:23:12,017 --> 02:23:13,249
behind him.

2043
02:23:13,249 --> 02:23:15,881
MATT: Okay. Make a stealth check.

2044
02:23:15,881 --> 02:23:19,059
SAM: Okay. A 15.

2045
02:23:19,059 --> 02:23:23,083
MATT: Good to know. That finishes Nott's turn.
Jester, you're up.

2046
02:23:23,083 --> 02:23:28,485
LAURA: Okay can I come around the corner and get
out of this nastiness? Ooh, it really did stick to it.

2047
02:23:28,585 --> 02:23:33,638
MATT: It really did stick to it. Five, ten, 15,
there.

2048
02:23:33,638 --> 02:23:36,784
LAURA: Can I see everything?

2049
02:23:36,784 --> 02:23:38,811
MATT: Yes, you see right where everyone is and
where this creature is.

2050
02:23:38,811 --> 02:23:43,185
LAURA: Okay I'm going to send my spiritual weapon
down there to bash it over the head!

2051
02:23:43,185 --> 02:23:46,015
MATT: 5, 10, 15, 20. 
It cannot quite get into range.

2052
02:23:46,171 --> 02:23:50,535
LAURA: How did Yasha get all the way there and my
thing didn't get there?

2053
02:23:50,535 --> 02:23:52,466
MATT: Because yours can only move 20 feet.

2054
02:23:52,466 --> 02:23:55,229
LAURA: That's so stupid. Okay.

2055
02:23:55,229 --> 02:23:56,817
MATT: I believe that's the case.

2056
02:23:56,817 --> 02:24:01,735
LAURA: Yeah, it's only 20. Then I'm going to use
Cure Wounds. Is it touch?

2057
02:24:01,735 --> 02:24:03,756
MATT: Cure Wounds is touch, I believe.

2058
02:24:03,756 --> 02:24:05,320
LAURA: Motherfucker!

2059
02:24:08,200 --> 02:24:10,155
LIAM: Healing Word, maybe.

2060
02:24:10,171 --> 02:24:14,751
LAURA: Yeah but it's like dog shit. Aw, look at
that.

2061
02:24:14,751 --> 02:24:16,998
ASHLEY: Does it sparkle? It's got all sparkly
little--

2062
02:24:16,998 --> 02:24:19,504
LAURA: Isn't it so pretty?

2063
02:24:19,504 --> 02:24:21,431
TALIESIN: It really ties the sewer together.

2064
02:24:21,431 --> 02:24:23,894
(laughter)

2065
02:24:23,894 --> 02:24:25,498
MATT: There it is.

2066
02:24:25,498 --> 02:24:29,952
LAURA: Healing Word is such dog shit, as far as
what it can do.

2067
02:24:29,952 --> 02:24:32,756
SAM: Healing Word? No, it's not!

2068
02:24:32,756 --> 02:24:41,752
LAURA: Psh, sure whatever. I guess I'll do Healing
Word to cure you. But you're going to go down

2069
02:24:41,752 --> 02:24:43,486
again, it's not enough to heal you--

2070
02:24:43,486 --> 02:24:44,894
TRAVIS: I'm going to take a healing potion.

2071
02:24:44,894 --> 02:24:46,080
LAURA: Oh, you are?

2072
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:47,058
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2073
02:24:48,738 --> 02:24:50,393
SAM: Do your thing.

2074
02:24:50,566 --> 02:24:52,066
TALIESIN: Or do damage.

2075
02:24:52,066 --> 02:25:00,227
LAURA: I'm going to-- I'm sorry, you guys. I'm
going to Sacred Flame it, then.

2076
02:25:00,227 --> 02:25:02,833
MATT: Okay. What's the--

2077
02:25:02,833 --> 02:25:04,673
LAURA: 1d8 radiant.

2078
02:25:04,673 --> 02:25:13,511
MATT: Well it needs to make a saving throw, right?
That is an 11. I think your DC is 13 right? Yeah.

2079
02:25:13,511 --> 02:25:15,137
Roll damage.

2080
02:25:15,137 --> 02:25:16,106
LAURA: Okay.

2081
02:25:18,327 --> 02:25:20,392
Aw, two.

2082
02:25:20,392 --> 02:25:25,843
MATT: Two points radiant damage. Hey, it all
helps. A burst of radiant flame suddenly

2083
02:25:25,843 --> 02:25:30,514
encompasses the front part of its body, between
the impact of the bolt, the slashing from Yasha,

2084
02:25:30,514 --> 02:25:36,578
and the blast, it looks like it's starting to feel
a moment of fight or flight. That end your turn?

2085
02:25:36,578 --> 02:25:38,997
LAURA: Yeah, it does.

2086
02:25:38,997 --> 02:25:40,613
MATT: Caleb, Fjord, you're up.

2087
02:25:40,613 --> 02:25:43,650
LIAM: Okay, I can see a straight line from the
spider to me so I think--

2088
02:25:43,650 --> 02:25:46,745
MATT: It does have partial cover, though, because
of the angle you're at.

2089
02:25:46,745 --> 02:25:53,152
LIAM: Yeah, okay, all right. I'm going to use my
movement to crawl out of the box so I can get a

2090
02:25:53,152 --> 02:25:58,751
better bead on it hopefully. I'll go as far
forward and to the side as I can to get a better angle.

2091
02:25:58,909 --> 02:26:05,797
MATT: (counting) That'll improve your sight
there.

2092
02:26:05,797 --> 02:26:13,601
LIAM: Okay, so I am going to steady my arm against
the other arm and point at it, and blacken my hand

2093
02:26:13,601 --> 02:26:19,570
and send a Fire Bolt at it. Here it goes, we'll
see if it hits probably not. No, I don't think it

2094
02:26:19,570 --> 02:26:23,079
does. That is a 11.

2095
02:26:23,079 --> 02:26:31,144
MATT: That unfortunately does not hit. As it's
reacting from the impacts, it begins to rear back,

2096
02:26:31,144 --> 02:26:34,936
and as it does there's this one flash of light. It
seems like it notices its presence and gets really

2097
02:26:34,936 --> 02:26:39,344
low and flat suddenly. Its whole body, which is
massive, shrinks low to the sewer as it passes

2098
02:26:39,344 --> 02:26:42,277
overhead. It pops back up, ready.

2099
02:26:42,277 --> 02:26:47,431
LIAM: Then before the end of my turn I'm going to
(snapping) and Schmidt silently comes up as close

2100
02:26:47,431 --> 02:26:48,909
as he can get next to me.

2101
02:26:48,909 --> 02:26:51,275
MATT: That ends your turn?

2102
02:26:51,275 --> 02:26:52,107
LIAM: Ja.

2103
02:26:52,107 --> 02:26:55,442
MATT: All righty. It's now the spider's turn.

2104
02:26:55,442 --> 02:26:56,562
TRAVIS: It's my turn.

2105
02:26:56,562 --> 02:26:57,877
MATT: That's right, I forgot.

2106
02:26:57,877 --> 02:27:03,990
TRAVIS: With my bonus action, can I cast
Hexblade's Curse on the spider?

2107
02:27:03,990 --> 02:27:05,533
MATT: Yes, you may.

2108
02:27:05,533 --> 02:27:09,899
LAURA: You should just kill it! Kill it! It's
already nervous, kill it and don't worry about

2109
02:27:09,899 --> 02:27:11,233
healing yourself.

2110
02:27:11,233 --> 02:27:12,982
ASHLEY: He's looking rough.

2111
02:27:12,982 --> 02:27:14,912
LAURA: Destroy it, Fjord!

2112
02:27:14,912 --> 02:27:23,608
TRAVIS: With the fucking glove of blasting, that
we took off the thing, can I go (grunting) and

2113
02:27:23,608 --> 02:27:28,985
fire all three of the Scorching Ray balls at the
spider?

2114
02:27:28,985 --> 02:27:31,612
MATT: You may. Make your three attacks with
disadvantage because it's a ranged attack in

2115
02:27:31,612 --> 02:27:33,829
immediate face-to-face range.

2116
02:27:35,859 --> 02:27:37,992
TRAVIS: That's a nine, plus two for 11.

2117
02:27:37,992 --> 02:27:40,541
MATT: 11 misses. The first one goes wide, second
strike.

2118
02:27:41,461 --> 02:27:42,783
TRAVIS: That's a one.

2119
02:27:42,916 --> 02:27:44,492
MATT: Goes wide again.

2120
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:49,118
TRAVIS: 16.

2121
02:27:49,118 --> 02:27:52,614
MATT: 16 does hit. Your first time using the
glove, you're not too sure how the aiming works

2122
02:27:52,614 --> 02:27:56,784
and the first two go off to the side, you're like
"Shit! Shit!" (boom) The third one finally

2123
02:27:56,784 --> 02:27:58,676
impacts. Roll damage for that.

2124
02:27:58,676 --> 02:28:01,005
LIAM: Aw man that's that Fjord edge right there.

2125
02:28:01,005 --> 02:28:03,508
TRAVIS: That's right. Eight points of damage.

2126
02:28:03,508 --> 02:28:10,623
MATT: Eight points of fire damage. Plus, does your
Hexblade's Curse do anything on that? Don't you

2127
02:28:10,623 --> 02:28:11,767
add your--

2128
02:28:11,767 --> 02:28:23,019
TRAVIS: Plus two to hit, that's it. No, damage
two, proficiency. Thank you.

2129
02:28:23,019 --> 02:28:23,832
MATT: It's ten, right?

2130
02:28:23,832 --> 02:28:24,744
TRAVIS: Ten, thank you.

2131
02:28:24,744 --> 02:28:31,329
MATT: (explosion) The second the Scorching Ray
blast hits it as it's rearing upright now, and as

2132
02:28:31,329 --> 02:28:37,528
it lights up you can see the streaks of blue
designs across its pale white body. The flames

2133
02:28:37,528 --> 02:28:44,953
impact and burn around the side, it pulls back
ready, angrily back towards you. That ends your turn?

2134
02:28:45,460 --> 02:28:46,545
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2135
02:28:46,545 --> 02:28:49,262
SAM: What happened to the healing coming?

2136
02:28:49,262 --> 02:28:50,678
MATT: It didn't happen.

2137
02:28:50,678 --> 02:28:52,653
TALIESIN: He's a liar. He's a lying liar.

2138
02:28:52,653 --> 02:28:54,728
TRAVIS: You just got to kill the spider and I'll
be fine.

2139
02:28:54,728 --> 02:28:55,980
TALIESIN: Fair.

2140
02:28:55,980 --> 02:28:58,451
MATT: It's trying to decide what is the biggest
threat right now. I'm going to roll for it,

2141
02:28:58,451 --> 02:29:00,495
between Yasha and Fjord.

2142
02:29:00,495 --> 02:29:02,065
LIAM: Schmidt, it's Schmidt.

2143
02:29:02,065 --> 02:29:03,727
MATT: It's going to go for Yasha.

2144
02:29:03,727 --> 02:29:05,556
LAURA: Oh, thank god.

2145
02:29:05,556 --> 02:29:09,643
TALIESIN: Blood Maledict. I see it look at her and
I immediately full Blood Maledict. I'm going to do

2146
02:29:09,643 --> 02:29:15,304
the fucked up one and I'm going to take four
points of damage for it. There you go. I have that

2147
02:29:15,304 --> 02:29:19,438
moment, I look at it, and my neck bursts and I
bleed out the vein.

2148
02:29:19,438 --> 02:29:26,112
MATT: You watch as a vein pours out the side, and
the currently six intact red eyes of the spider

2149
02:29:26,112 --> 02:29:33,161
all cloud over black with bits of trickling, dark
purplish blood pouring from the edges of them.

2150
02:29:33,161 --> 02:29:43,194
That gives it disadvantage. Which you are very
lucky it is because that was a natural 20. That

2151
02:29:43,194 --> 02:29:46,988
still comes to 16. Does that hit?

2152
02:29:46,988 --> 02:29:47,843
ASHLEY: That hits.

2153
02:29:47,843 --> 02:29:57,064
MATT: You take, from the fangs as it lurches
towards you, oof, that's going to be 11 points of

2154
02:29:57,064 --> 02:29:58,079
piercing damage.

2155
02:29:58,079 --> 02:29:59,261
ASHLEY: Halved.

2156
02:29:59,261 --> 02:30:00,553
MATT: Yes, because you're raging.

2157
02:30:00,553 --> 02:30:03,907
(cheering)

2158
02:30:03,907 --> 02:30:07,063
MATT: You take five points of piercing damage, and
I need you to make a constitution saving throw,

2159
02:30:07,063 --> 02:30:07,954
please.

2160
02:30:07,954 --> 02:30:09,381
ASHLEY: Okay.

2161
02:30:13,561 --> 02:30:14,947
MARISHA: You've got this.

2162
02:30:17,571 --> 02:30:18,847
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

2163
02:30:18,847 --> 02:30:20,975
TRAVIS: Woo, crit on that shit!

2164
02:30:20,975 --> 02:30:27,411
MATT: As it lurches forward and slams its fangs in
the collar bone area, you having no real armor to

2165
02:30:27,411 --> 02:30:33,187
protect it, you take it head on. The fangs sink
and you feel the venom pulse through your torso,

2166
02:30:33,187 --> 02:30:40,210
through your arms. The burning pains goes through
and you flex it off. As you do so, thankfully

2167
02:30:40,210 --> 02:30:46,850
reducing what would have been-- you only take 11
points of poison damage.

2168
02:30:48,990 --> 02:30:52,987
LIAM: Yasha is a heavy metal album. That's pretty
dope.

2169
02:30:53,367 --> 02:30:58,455
MATT: It now sees you all moving around it, and it
looks like it's been hurting. You watch as its

2170
02:30:58,455 --> 02:31:00,809
form vanishes.

2171
02:31:00,809 --> 02:31:02,189
MARISHA: No!

2172
02:31:02,189 --> 02:31:03,483
ASHLEY: 11 in addition to the--

2173
02:31:03,483 --> 02:31:08,235
MATT: Yeah. You watch as it vanishes from the
space. That's where you last saw it.

2174
02:31:09,965 --> 02:31:11,078
SAM: Wow.

2175
02:31:11,233 --> 02:31:13,930
MATT: Ending its turn, Beau and Molly, you're up.

2176
02:31:13,930 --> 02:31:15,818
SAM: We killed it!

2177
02:31:16,888 --> 02:31:18,684
ASHLEY: Did it bamf?

2178
02:31:18,684 --> 02:31:20,023
TALIESIN: Bamfed.

2179
02:31:20,165 --> 02:31:24,645
MARISHA: Okay. Where's it going to go, I'm going
to--

2180
02:31:24,645 --> 02:31:27,948
TALIESIN: Let's form up, stick close.

2181
02:31:27,948 --> 02:31:31,333
MARISHA: I'm going to split the difference and go
here.

2182
02:31:31,333 --> 02:31:33,505
TALIESIN: Don't get so far that we can't get to
you if it hits you.

2183
02:31:33,505 --> 02:31:38,470
MARISHA: I'm not, I'm going there, because I still
want to be able to get to it. I'm going to hold a

2184
02:31:38,470 --> 02:31:45,917
Flurry of-- Can I hold a ki point action? Or can I
hold an attack? Or can I hold an attack and then

2185
02:31:45,917 --> 02:31:50,954
decide I want it to be a flurry of blows?

2186
02:31:53,926 --> 02:31:56,939
MATT: You cannot make a bonus action attack on a
held action so you cannot unfortunately make a

2187
02:31:56,939 --> 02:31:59,420
Flurry of Blows, I don't believe, as a held
action.

2188
02:31:59,420 --> 02:32:05,041
MARISHA: Can I take the bonus attack now, to do
the ki point and hold it?

2189
02:32:05,041 --> 02:32:06,876
MATT: No, unfortunately.

2190
02:32:06,876 --> 02:32:10,163
MARISHA: Okay. This is balls, y'all.

2191
02:32:10,163 --> 02:32:12,720
LIAM: Yeah. Spider's an asshole.

2192
02:32:12,720 --> 02:32:16,125
MARISHA: I'll hold until I see it to make an
attack.

2193
02:32:16,125 --> 02:32:20,573
MATT: Okay, so you're holding your action until it
appears into range. Good to know. Molly.

2194
02:32:20,573 --> 02:32:27,999
TALIESIN: I'm sticking with everybody, and let me
take one-- where am I? Let me take like a step

2195
02:32:27,999 --> 02:32:31,158
back and hold my action there.

2196
02:32:31,158 --> 02:32:35,959
MATT: Okay. You step back and stumble over one of
the crownsguard bodies that you left on the

2197
02:32:35,959 --> 02:32:41,107
ground, but you hold yourself there, using it as
one foot, slightly elevated platform being at the

2198
02:32:41,107 --> 02:32:42,591
ready. You're holding your attack action?

2199
02:32:42,591 --> 02:32:43,446
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

2200
02:32:43,446 --> 02:32:45,225
MATT: That ends Molly's go. Yasha, you're up.

2201
02:32:45,225 --> 02:32:51,731
ASHLEY: Oh, shit. Okay, it's gone, so we don't
know where it is?

2202
02:32:51,731 --> 02:32:54,221
MATT: It appears to have vanished.

2203
02:32:54,221 --> 02:33:02,144
ASHLEY: We don't see it. Okay. I feel like we
should get closer. I'm going to move over to

2204
02:33:02,144 --> 02:33:03,029
Fjord.

2205
02:33:03,029 --> 02:33:04,943
MATT: To there?

2206
02:33:04,943 --> 02:33:06,761
ASHLEY: Yeah, back against the wall.

2207
02:33:08,031 --> 02:33:09,476
LAURA: The music.

2208
02:33:09,600 --> 02:33:10,572
MARISHA: I know.

2209
02:33:10,572 --> 02:33:12,240
ASHLEY: (mimics the music)

2210
02:33:12,240 --> 02:33:13,964
LAURA: On Yasha's move.

2211
02:33:13,964 --> 02:33:16,064
MARISHA: (electric guitar sounds)

2212
02:33:16,064 --> 02:33:18,816
TRAVIS: (bass guitar sounds)

2213
02:33:19,456 --> 02:33:22,223
ASHLEY: I think that's-- oh, can I do Healing
Hands on myself?

2214
02:33:22,223 --> 02:33:23,563
MATT: You can, yeah.

2215
02:33:23,616 --> 02:33:25,652
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll do Healing Hands on myself.

2216
02:33:25,652 --> 02:33:29,712
MATT: As Yasha backs up against the wall,
greatsword in one hand, you watch as she puts her

2217
02:33:29,712 --> 02:33:38,989
arm to her chest. There's a faint glow of very
faint whitish energy and her wounds heal up

2218
02:33:38,989 --> 02:33:40,413
slightly.

2219
02:33:40,413 --> 02:33:42,500
TRAVIS: What the fuck?!

2220
02:33:42,500 --> 02:33:44,773
MARISHA: You didn't have that, did you? You
couldn't do that type of shit.

2221
02:33:44,773 --> 02:33:46,456
TRAVIS: No, she's path of the zealot.

2222
02:33:46,456 --> 02:33:48,595
ASHLEY: Well, I think it's because I'm--

2223
02:33:48,595 --> 02:33:50,498
TALIESIN and ASHLEY: Stuff.

2224
02:33:50,498 --> 02:33:53,332
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Because reasons?

2225
02:33:53,332 --> 02:33:54,687
MATT: That finishes your turn, Yasha?

2226
02:33:54,687 --> 02:33:56,146
ASHLEY: Yes.

2227
02:33:56,146 --> 02:33:58,289
TRAVIS: What's that called, what did you use?

2228
02:33:58,289 --> 02:33:59,971
ASHLEY: Healing Hands.

2229
02:33:59,971 --> 02:34:01,988
TALIESIN: It's called Princes of the Universe.

2230
02:34:01,988 --> 02:34:03,564
SAM: Is someone going to heal Fjord?

2231
02:34:03,564 --> 02:34:05,360
LAURA: Yes, I'm going to on my turn.

2232
02:34:05,360 --> 02:34:21,937
SAM: Okay. Oh boy. I'll stay put, and hold my
attack until I can see the whites of its pincers.

2233
02:34:21,937 --> 02:34:29,105
As a bonus action, I'll cast Mage Hand and start
digging around some rocks, see if there's anything

2234
02:34:29,105 --> 02:34:30,368
over there.

2235
02:34:30,368 --> 02:34:34,720
MATT: Well, Mage Hand is an action to cast, so you
can't hold--

2236
02:34:34,720 --> 02:34:36,220
SAM: Not anymore.

2237
02:34:36,220 --> 02:34:38,729
MATT: Oh, no, with your legerdemain, right?

2238
02:34:38,729 --> 02:34:39,703
SAM: Yeah.

2239
02:34:42,683 --> 02:34:44,178
LAURA: Legerdemain?

2240
02:34:44,352 --> 02:34:45,360
SAM: I don't know.

2241
02:34:45,360 --> 02:34:47,085
LIAM: We're all still figuring it out.

2242
02:34:47,085 --> 02:34:52,339
SAM: You can use the bonus action granted by your
cunning action to control the hand.

2243
02:34:52,339 --> 02:34:55,566
MATT: Oh, it means once it's already out, you can
do that to use a bonus action. But you have to get

2244
02:34:55,566 --> 02:34:56,356
it out.

2245
02:34:56,356 --> 02:34:57,620
SAM: Got it. Then nevermind.

2246
02:34:57,620 --> 02:34:58,642
MATT: So you're holding your action there?

2247
02:34:58,642 --> 02:34:59,747
SAM: I'm holding my attack.

2248
02:34:59,763 --> 02:35:01,551
MATT: Good to know. Top of the round. Jester,
you're up.

2249
02:35:01,551 --> 02:35:08,930
LAURA: Okay. How far away are they? I'm going to
move forward. Can I get all the way to Fjord? I'm

2250
02:35:08,930 --> 02:35:11,978
afraid to get too far away from Caleb.

2251
02:35:11,978 --> 02:35:14,357
MATT: (counting) You can get up to him.

2252
02:35:14,357 --> 02:35:15,992
TRAVIS: You don't need to heal me.

2253
02:35:15,992 --> 02:35:17,230
LAURA: I'm going to heal you.

2254
02:35:17,230 --> 02:35:18,594
TRAVIS: If it dies, I gain seven hit points.

2255
02:35:18,691 --> 02:35:22,277
LAURA: Okay, good. You'll gain seven more than I
can heal you, because I'm going to cast Cure

2256
02:35:22,277 --> 02:35:23,473
Wounds on him!

2257
02:35:23,473 --> 02:35:25,123
SAM and TALIESIN: Yay!

2258
02:35:25,123 --> 02:35:27,368
LAURA: Yay. Six points.

2259
02:35:27,368 --> 02:35:33,005
TRAVIS: Thanks, Jester. I owe you one.

2260
02:35:33,005 --> 02:35:35,504
LAURA: You don't owe me shit.

2261
02:35:35,504 --> 02:35:41,497
MATT: Anything else you want to do? Move your
spiritual weapon or anything?

2262
02:35:41,497 --> 02:35:49,016
LAURA: I'm going to move my spiritual weapon in
the middle, closer to Beau.

2263
02:35:49,016 --> 02:35:50,237
MATT: Okay, so there?

2264
02:35:50,237 --> 02:35:51,179
LAURA: Yeah.

2265
02:35:51,179 --> 02:35:53,062
TRAVIS: We're not considered poisoned if we got
bit, right?

2266
02:35:53,062 --> 02:35:56,772
MATT: No. That ends your go, Jester. Caleb and
Fjord, you're up.

2267
02:35:56,772 --> 02:36:01,258
LIAM: Because sightlines are a problem here, I
would like to move to dead center where Jester

2268
02:36:01,258 --> 02:36:07,103
just was, actually, so I have a clear sight on the
chamber behind me and ahead of me.

2269
02:36:07,103 --> 02:36:09,523
MATT: 20, 25, 30?

2270
02:36:09,639 --> 02:36:12,811
LIAM: Yeah. I can see everywhere, more or less, in
here.

2271
02:36:12,811 --> 02:36:13,926
MATT: Yes, you can.

2272
02:36:13,926 --> 02:36:18,222
LIAM: I pull the diamond out from my coat and get
ready, and I hold. As soon as I see the spider,

2273
02:36:18,222 --> 02:36:21,097
I'm going to release Chromatic Orb.

2274
02:36:21,097 --> 02:36:24,356
MATT: Okay. Good to know. That ends your turn,
Caleb. Fjord, what are you doing?

2275
02:36:24,356 --> 02:36:36,319
TRAVIS: I'd like to move closer to the group.
(counting) I turn here and I will hold my attack.

2276
02:36:36,319 --> 02:36:38,349
MATT: Okay. In case he comes into range.

2277
02:36:38,349 --> 02:36:39,126
TRAVIS: Yes.

2278
02:36:39,126 --> 02:36:49,055
MATT: Good to know. Okay. End of your turn? Last
you saw it there. You watch as there's a faint

2279
02:36:49,055 --> 02:36:56,313
ripple in the air. You just finishing healing
Fjord, as he runs past, you turn and smile and

2280
02:36:56,313 --> 02:37:04,232
turn back just in time to see it, not far from
where it vanished, appear right there.

2281
02:37:04,232 --> 02:37:05,899
MARISHA: Damn it.

2282
02:37:05,899 --> 02:37:07,501
LAURA: (screams)

2283
02:37:07,501 --> 02:37:10,618
MATT: It does get a surprise strike on you, which
has advantage. Disadvantage thanks to your last

2284
02:37:10,618 --> 02:37:12,724
ability, so it's just a straight attack roll.

2285
02:37:15,185 --> 02:37:16,770
That is a natural one.

2286
02:37:16,770 --> 02:37:18,254
LAURA: (sigh of relief)

2287
02:37:18,254 --> 02:37:19,542
SAM: Wow!

2288
02:37:19,542 --> 02:37:29,054
MATT: That's okay. It will use its movement to
move down, and go up the wall here.

2289
02:37:29,054 --> 02:37:32,868
LAURA: It died! Yay, we killed it!

2290
02:37:32,868 --> 02:37:38,699
MATT: If we went by those rules, you guys would've
been dead a long time ago. All right, so you do

2291
02:37:38,699 --> 02:37:41,600
get an attack of opportunity on it as you swing
past. Go ahead and make your strike.

2292
02:37:41,600 --> 02:37:42,695
LAURA: Okay!

2293
02:37:42,695 --> 02:37:44,322
MATT: With your somewhat web-covered--

2294
02:37:44,322 --> 02:37:45,941
LAURA: No, we got all of it off, remember?

2295
02:37:45,941 --> 02:37:46,965
MATT: Right.

2296
02:37:46,965 --> 02:37:49,399
TALIESIN: Slightly warm. Toasted.

2297
02:37:49,769 --> 02:37:51,684
LAURA: 18? No, 17?

2298
02:37:51,859 --> 02:37:55,334
MATT: 17 hits. By the way, those of you that were
in range to attack with that held action would've

2299
02:37:55,334 --> 02:37:59,218
been just Caleb and Nott. Both of you guys get
attack--

2300
02:37:59,218 --> 02:38:00,580
LIAM: It's about 90 feet.

2301
02:38:00,580 --> 02:38:02,109
TRAVIS: I don't get a ranged?

2302
02:38:02,109 --> 02:38:03,650
MATT: You were holding your attack, you said.

2303
02:38:03,650 --> 02:38:06,106
TRAVIS: Yeah. Do I have to say ranged spell
attack?

2304
02:38:06,161 --> 02:38:08,896
MATT: You have to say what spell you're holding.
It's either I'm holding an attack or I'm holding a spell.

2305
02:38:08,896 --> 02:38:10,370
TRAVIS: Sorry. I've learned.

2306
02:38:10,481 --> 02:38:11,591
MATT: Now you know.

2307
02:38:11,591 --> 02:38:12,785
LAURA: Seven damage!

2308
02:38:12,785 --> 02:38:14,918
MATT: Seven damage, nice.

2309
02:38:14,918 --> 02:38:22,407
LIAM: I prepped acid on this thing and I missed
bad. I got a total of nine, so that did not hit.

2310
02:38:22,407 --> 02:38:23,729
MATT: A total of nein?

2311
02:38:23,729 --> 02:38:25,820
LIAM: Yeah. No, just nine.

2312
02:38:25,820 --> 02:38:31,658
MATT: So (fwoosh), and as you throw your orb, it
skitters up the wall. You almost hit it, but it

2313
02:38:31,824 --> 02:38:35,675
pulls out of the way before it shatters, the orb
splattering acid across the stonework, burning

2314
02:38:35,675 --> 02:38:40,044
through whatever outer layer of thick liquid has
congealed there.

2315
02:38:40,044 --> 02:38:45,506
SAM: From where I'm hidden to where it was when it
appeared, how far is that?

2316
02:38:45,506 --> 02:38:50,200
MATT: From where it appeared? That would've been
40 feet from you.

2317
02:38:50,200 --> 02:38:51,836
SAM: So I have to roll with disadvantage?

2318
02:38:51,836 --> 02:38:53,477
MATT: Yes, you do.

2319
02:38:53,477 --> 02:38:55,760
SAM: Ooh, not as good. 11.

2320
02:38:55,760 --> 02:39:02,387
MATT: Goes wide, no impact, unfortunately. That
ends the spider's turn. Beau, Molly, you're up.

2321
02:39:02,387 --> 02:39:06,858
MARISHA: Ugh. Can I close the gap? With my 40 foot
movement?

2322
02:39:06,858 --> 02:39:13,163
MATT and MARISHA: (counting)

2323
02:39:13,163 --> 02:39:16,954
MATT: It's above you on the wall.

2324
02:39:16,954 --> 02:39:19,490
MARISHA: Can I--

2325
02:39:19,490 --> 02:39:21,790
SAM: Throw your throwing stars!

2326
02:39:21,790 --> 02:39:26,883
MARISHA: Like I'm trying to get spiders out of the
corner ceiling with a broomstick! Exactly.

2327
02:39:26,883 --> 02:39:29,958
MATT: I'll tell you what. I'll give you the
attack, you'll have disadvantage, and if you miss,

2328
02:39:29,958 --> 02:39:32,736
you're prone. But I'll give you the attack if you
want to.

2329
02:39:32,736 --> 02:39:34,488
TRAVIS: Ooh. I like the risk.

2330
02:39:34,488 --> 02:39:36,201
LIAM: Worth the risk. That's exciting.

2331
02:39:36,201 --> 02:39:37,919
SAM: It's impossible.

2332
02:39:37,919 --> 02:39:40,853
MATT: There is a path that helps with that, but
not this thing.

2333
02:39:40,853 --> 02:39:48,374
MARISHA: Of course I do! I'm going to do the
full-- I'm like, wasp, get the wasp!

2334
02:39:48,374 --> 02:39:52,989
MATT: All right, you leap up to get your single
attack on it with your bo. Go for it. Roll at a

2335
02:39:52,989 --> 02:39:53,960
disadvantage.

2336
02:39:53,960 --> 02:39:54,863
MARISHA: Disadvantage.

2337
02:39:57,343 --> 02:39:58,637
TRAVIS: You got it!

2338
02:39:58,637 --> 02:40:01,819
MARISHA: I got it! I did! I rolled a 15 and a 17!

2339
02:40:01,819 --> 02:40:03,358
MATT: That's pretty slick.

2340
02:40:03,448 --> 02:40:04,486
MARISHA: So that's 21!

2341
02:40:04,486 --> 02:40:05,914
MATT: That hits! Roll damage.

2342
02:40:05,914 --> 02:40:08,047
TRAVIS: Don't move, don't move!

2343
02:40:08,047 --> 02:40:11,309
MARISHA: Better call an exterminator!

2344
02:40:12,879 --> 02:40:13,988
LIAM: Raid!

2345
02:40:14,095 --> 02:40:15,145
MARISHA: 11.

2346
02:40:15,145 --> 02:40:20,147
MATT: 11 points of damage. As you leap and smack
it in the face, it pulls up a little bit further

2347
02:40:20,147 --> 02:40:27,498
away, screeching at the impact. It's looking
pretty rough. It's still around, but that was not

2348
02:40:27,498 --> 02:40:31,019
a positive hit for it.

2349
02:40:31,019 --> 02:40:35,401
MARISHA: Do I have room to still get one more
swat? Probably not.

2350
02:40:35,401 --> 02:40:37,899
MATT: I gave you the one. You're technically just
out of range.

2351
02:40:37,899 --> 02:40:39,005
MARISHA: Okay.

2352
02:40:39,005 --> 02:40:41,769
MATT: That was part of the risk. That end your
turn?

2353
02:40:41,769 --> 02:40:43,065
MARISHA: Yeah, I guess so.

2354
02:40:43,065 --> 02:40:44,056
MATT: Molly?

2355
02:40:44,056 --> 02:40:49,350
TALIESIN: I'm going to at least run up to the
other side of Jester, just to keep us clumped a

2356
02:40:49,350 --> 02:40:57,784
little bit. What I can do is I can do Vicious
Mockery again. I'm going to cast Vicious Mockery

2357
02:40:57,784 --> 02:41:04,955
and (Infernal voice) I'll cut off your legs! Give
it a shot. Make a roll against wisdom.

2358
02:41:04,955 --> 02:41:09,391
SAM: He can say anything with that voice and it
would sound awful.

2359
02:41:09,391 --> 02:41:11,728
TALIESIN: (Infernal voice) Who ate all the
Cracklin' Oat Bran?

2360
02:41:11,728 --> 02:41:14,568
SAM: (Infernal voice) Can I have a fishing rod?

2361
02:41:14,568 --> 02:41:16,559
(laughter)

2362
02:41:16,609 --> 02:41:19,165
TALIESIN: Save versus wisdom?

2363
02:41:19,338 --> 02:41:22,391
MATT: Yeah, your spell DC would be eight plus your
proficiency, which is ten. Plus your wisdom

2364
02:41:22,391 --> 02:41:23,814
modifier, which is what?

2365
02:41:23,814 --> 02:41:25,405
TALIESIN: Wisdom modifier is three.

2366
02:41:25,405 --> 02:41:27,218
MATT: Three. Yeah, that hits! Roll damage.

2367
02:41:27,218 --> 02:41:31,162
ASHLEY: Come on. Mock him.

2368
02:41:31,162 --> 02:41:40,520
TALIESIN: I mock him and that's three points of
psychic damage, and he has-- really? Does it not

2369
02:41:40,520 --> 02:41:43,492
even matter? Then he has disadvantage on the next
attack.

2370
02:41:43,492 --> 02:41:44,827
MATT: How do you want to do this?

2371
02:41:44,827 --> 02:41:46,977
(cheering)

2372
02:41:46,977 --> 02:41:48,805
MATT: As you mock the spider to death.

2373
02:41:48,805 --> 02:41:52,716
TALIESIN: Something about my words are just making
his blood boil.

2374
02:41:52,716 --> 02:41:58,624
MATT: As you screech out this phrase in
Infernal--

2375
02:41:58,624 --> 02:42:00,966
TALIESIN: (Infernal voice) I whisper and then I
fire.

2376
02:42:00,966 --> 02:42:06,171
MATT: As its legs begin to skitter upward, and as
it tries to escape up the top of the ceiling, it

2377
02:42:06,171 --> 02:42:12,493
loses its grip upon the top of the sewer ceiling.
It falls, slamming on the ground next to Beau, and

2378
02:42:12,493 --> 02:42:16,584
its legs begin to curl in. As it's shaking, you
see blood pouring from wounds that weren't there

2379
02:42:16,584 --> 02:42:21,178
before. It seems the Infernal itself has affected
him physically from the inside. It begins to curl

2380
02:42:21,178 --> 02:42:26,325
its legs in deeper and deeper, the sound of its
guttural shrieking getting softer and softer--

2381
02:42:27,651 --> 02:42:34,739
MARISHA: I turn around and go, don't worry guys, I
got it. Good ol' broomstick trick. Works every time.

2382
02:42:36,418 --> 02:42:39,188
LIAM: Put him in a mocking bag, Molly!

2383
02:42:39,188 --> 02:42:41,056
TALIESIN: I never had it do that before.

2384
02:42:41,056 --> 02:42:43,143
TRAVIS: I regain seven hit points.

2385
02:42:43,143 --> 02:42:44,753
MATT: There you go.

2386
02:42:44,753 --> 02:42:47,745
LAURA: No, don't take it away. I'm going to lick
it.

2387
02:42:47,745 --> 02:42:49,003
MATT: Okay.

2388
02:42:49,003 --> 02:42:52,990
LAURA: It didn't hit anything. It's not even
covered with any guts.

2389
02:42:52,990 --> 02:42:54,795
MATT: That's true.

2390
02:42:54,795 --> 02:42:58,391
ASHLEY: I go up and I give Molly a slap on the
ass.

2391
02:42:58,391 --> 02:43:01,500
TALIESIN: You see what I mean? These people are
fun!

2392
02:43:01,500 --> 02:43:04,367
ASHLEY: It's good. That was fun.

2393
02:43:04,367 --> 02:43:07,532
TALIESIN: I'm going to go poke it with a sword.

2394
02:43:07,532 --> 02:43:11,807
LAURA: I'm going to go back to the halfling guy
that's kind of alive.

2395
02:43:11,807 --> 02:43:13,723
SAM: I'll come with you then.

2396
02:43:13,849 --> 02:43:16,139
TRAVIS: I'm going to kill the half-- no.

2397
02:43:16,139 --> 02:43:21,124
MATT: So it is a large body. The actual thorax of
it.

2398
02:43:21,124 --> 02:43:24,901
TALIESIN: I'm going to start binding it up for
travel.

2399
02:43:24,901 --> 02:43:27,920
MATT: Okay. Easy enough to do. It's legs are
intact, and they're sturdy enough. You bring out

2400
02:43:27,920 --> 02:43:30,730
whatever robe you have available, and you start
binding it and getting it in a position where it

2401
02:43:30,730 --> 02:43:38,967
could probably be either on her staff or whatever
else you have and carry over shoulders. You guys

2402
02:43:38,967 --> 02:43:44,143
approach the halfling: still unconscious, the arm
draped out from the webbing.

2403
02:43:44,143 --> 02:43:46,661
LAURA: Does he look injured at all?

2404
02:43:46,661 --> 02:43:48,255
TALIESIN: It's very dark still, also.

2405
02:43:48,255 --> 02:43:51,495
MATT: It is very dark, and there's still this
torch left in the center there where Yasha dropped it.

2406
02:43:51,627 --> 02:43:53,374
LAURA: Oh shit. Can I have grabbed that as I walk
over to him?

2407
02:43:53,374 --> 02:43:56,414
MATT: Sure! You grab the torch and you bring it
over. You get a close look. There's the web mass

2408
02:43:56,414 --> 02:44:04,536
in the corner. There's the other bodies on the
side, The halfling looks to be injured in the

2409
02:44:04,536 --> 02:44:10,239
sense that it looks like they took a blow to the
head. There's a slight bit of blood trickle along

2410
02:44:10,239 --> 02:44:11,503
the hairline.

2411
02:44:11,503 --> 02:44:13,857
LAURA: Can I put my hand on his head and cast Cure
Wounds?

2412
02:44:13,857 --> 02:44:17,414
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll for the hit points
regained there.

2413
02:44:17,414 --> 02:44:19,887
LAURA: Now. 11.

2414
02:44:19,887 --> 02:44:23,984
LIAM: Actually, since I see that Jester has this
covered, I'm going to start burning out the dead

2415
02:44:23,984 --> 02:44:26,104
people and rooting through their pockets and
stuff.

2416
02:44:26,104 --> 02:44:28,652
MARISHA: I'll still stick with Jester, though.
Just in case he's--

2417
02:44:28,652 --> 02:44:29,866
LIAM: That's good.

2418
02:44:29,866 --> 02:44:40,588
MATT: There's a moment after you finish casting it
where the halfling shakes the head. "What's going on?"

2419
02:44:41,015 --> 02:44:46,252
LAURA: Blessed child. You are alive. Your saviors
have come.

2420
02:44:46,252 --> 02:44:50,676
MATT: You see one eye is almost still glued shut
from webbing that's across the front of it, but

2421
02:44:50,676 --> 02:44:53,603
he's trying to open it. "I don't understand.
What's going on?"

2422
02:44:53,603 --> 02:44:54,895
SAM: You're safe now!

2423
02:44:54,895 --> 02:45:02,929
MATT: "Oh god! (panicked breathing)." He starts
looking around, looking up at the faint bit of

2424
02:45:02,929 --> 02:45:07,855
light now, which it's now just passing sunset. You
see a little bit of purple light coming through,

2425
02:45:07,855 --> 02:45:13,103
and through the little bits of webbing, you can
see the grate that leads outside. He goes, "I

2426
02:45:13,103 --> 02:45:15,576
don't know how I got here."

2427
02:45:15,576 --> 02:45:20,779
LAURA: You don't know how you got down here? You
didn't come to the sewer on your own?

2428
02:45:20,779 --> 02:45:24,538
MATT: "Well I-- Yeah, I guess."

2429
02:45:24,538 --> 02:45:26,469
MARISHA: What were you doing down here?

2430
02:45:26,469 --> 02:45:29,609
MATT: "Well, I was just trying to get somewhere
quickly."

2431
02:45:29,609 --> 02:45:31,206
MARISHA: Insight check.

2432
02:45:31,206 --> 02:45:37,437
MATT: Make an insight check. You see flames
bursting at the side. Every time, he flinches.

2433
02:45:38,575 --> 02:45:40,219
MARISHA: 18.

2434
02:45:40,219 --> 02:45:41,581
MATT: 18?

2435
02:45:41,581 --> 02:45:43,518
ASHLEY: Whisper?

2436
02:45:45,228 --> 02:45:46,847
SAM: Whispers.

2437
02:45:46,847 --> 02:45:48,748
TRAVIS: Far Cry 5!

2438
02:45:48,892 --> 02:45:51,300
SAM: Far Cry 5? I've heard about it.

2439
02:45:51,300 --> 02:45:56,711
TRAVIS: Fantastic multiplayer and all-new setting.
It takes place in the United States of America.

2440
02:45:56,711 --> 02:45:59,084
LIAM: Oh man. Full of lessons for America today.

2441
02:45:59,084 --> 02:46:04,438
TRAVIS: That's right. I even heard you could check
it out. Ubisoft's Far Cry 5.

2442
02:46:04,438 --> 02:46:11,259
MATT: "I'm sorry, I'm just-- oh god," and he looks
over and sees the other bodies on the wall and the

2443
02:46:11,259 --> 02:46:16,068
webbing. He's just, "(panicked screams) Help me!
Please help me!"

2444
02:46:16,068 --> 02:46:18,842
LAURA: No need to scream. We're getting you out,
don't worry.

2445
02:46:18,842 --> 02:46:21,733
LIAM: I'm only burning the dead ones! (fire
billowing)

2446
02:46:21,733 --> 02:46:24,436
TALIESIN: (muffled screams)

2447
02:46:27,146 --> 02:46:33,376
SAM: I'm going to say in Halfling to the man: it's
okay, just calm down. Everything's going to be

2448
02:46:33,410 --> 02:46:35,908
fine. I start cutting him out.

2449
02:46:35,908 --> 02:46:41,382
MATT: Okay. He nods. "Thank you," back to you in
Halfling. He's beginning to cut him free. What did

2450
02:46:41,382 --> 02:46:42,327
you say?

2451
02:46:42,327 --> 02:46:50,697
MARISHA: Tapping into my background a little bit,
I'm going to go: You know, I used to utilize the

2452
02:46:50,697 --> 02:46:55,710
sewers back in the day. Real good to stay out of
sight. Move stuff quickly.

2453
02:46:55,710 --> 02:47:04,348
MATT: "Yeah, well it's important when you're an
ale hand. You got to move product through the

2454
02:47:04,348 --> 02:47:05,540
sewers quickly."

2455
02:47:05,540 --> 02:47:06,648
MARISHA: What are you moving?

2456
02:47:06,648 --> 02:47:07,816
MATT: "Ale."

2457
02:47:07,816 --> 02:47:10,051
MARISHA: Okay.

2458
02:47:10,051 --> 02:47:12,454
LAURA: Do you have a key to the grates?

2459
02:47:12,454 --> 02:47:20,936
MATT: "Not a key, but I-- I have a key."

2460
02:47:20,936 --> 02:47:23,687
LAURA: Can you give us the key?

2461
02:47:23,687 --> 02:47:27,048
MATT: "You have to cut me free first."

2462
02:47:27,794 --> 02:47:33,450
MARISHA: Before we do that, what's your name,
friend?

2463
02:47:33,450 --> 02:47:35,103
MATT: "Thed."

2464
02:47:35,103 --> 02:47:36,148
MARISHA: Ted?

2465
02:47:36,148 --> 02:47:37,280
MATT: "Thed."

2466
02:47:37,280 --> 02:47:38,633
SAM, MARISHA, and LAURA: Thed.

2467
02:47:38,633 --> 02:47:40,566
LAURA: I thought he said "dead".

2468
02:47:40,566 --> 02:47:42,649
LIAM: Thed is dead, baby.

2469
02:47:42,649 --> 02:47:46,266
LAURA: Thed, where is the key? Which pocket is it
in?

2470
02:47:46,266 --> 02:47:48,685
MATT: "I'll be happy to show you once you cut me
free."

2471
02:47:48,685 --> 02:47:51,534
LAURA: I can start digging. I start digging
through his pockets.

2472
02:47:51,534 --> 02:47:56,032
MATT: Make an investigation check. At a closer
look, too, you can see he's got short, spiky, dark

2473
02:47:56,032 --> 02:48:01,287
hair and a little bit of a goatee that's trimmed
to a point at the end of the chin. The tattoos all

2474
02:48:01,287 --> 02:48:09,049
across the neck look like they're swirled,
serpentine shapes that all fold and knot together,

2475
02:48:09,049 --> 02:48:12,393
all across the throat, from front to back, like a
giant dark band.

2476
02:48:12,490 --> 02:48:14,032
LAURA: That's a tattoo, you said?

2477
02:48:14,032 --> 02:48:15,131
MATT: It's a tattoo, yeah.

2478
02:48:15,131 --> 02:48:19,700
MARISHA: Would I recognize that iconography or
have heard of that? Does that mean anything?

2479
02:48:19,700 --> 02:48:21,460
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

2480
02:48:21,940 --> 02:48:23,312
LIAM: It's a Nickelback tattoo.

2481
02:48:23,312 --> 02:48:25,169
(laughter)

2482
02:48:28,030 --> 02:48:31,022
MARISHA: Oh, nope. That's a big nope. That's a
natural one.

2483
02:48:31,022 --> 02:48:32,512
SAM: I'm going to cut him out.

2484
02:48:32,512 --> 02:48:36,621
MATT: Yeah, you don't. Okay. You cut him free,
he's like (heavy breathing).

2485
02:48:36,621 --> 02:48:39,749
LAURA: I rolled an 11 checking through his
pockets.

2486
02:48:39,749 --> 02:48:49,344
MATT: You do find he's wearing some nice,
black/gray leather armor. He has a pretty

2487
02:48:49,344 --> 02:48:57,887
nasty-looking shortsword. It's been altered to be
jagged at the edge of the blade. He has a small

2488
02:48:57,887 --> 02:49:02,095
leather case that's tucked in the armor. Don't
find a key.

2489
02:49:02,264 --> 02:49:03,401
LAURA: Okay.

2490
02:49:04,271 --> 02:49:06,279
TRAVIS: Jagged at the tip.

2491
02:49:06,279 --> 02:49:08,777
MARISHA: Jester. What's in that leather case?

2492
02:49:09,291 --> 02:49:11,580
SAM: Do you have the stuff? Or did you--

2493
02:49:11,580 --> 02:49:15,409
MATT: He's free now, as you cut him free, and he's
like (labored breaths). He stands up and he rights

2494
02:49:15,409 --> 02:49:20,457
himself, and checks everything and he looks to the
left and goes, "Um?" He points to the mass in the

2495
02:49:20,582 --> 02:49:27,541
corner, and you see the mass that's there. It's
not a series of bodies. It looks like it's a

2496
02:49:27,541 --> 02:49:31,305
slowly pulsing sac of some kind.

2497
02:49:31,305 --> 02:49:35,016
LAURA: Oh no, eggs. Oh no!

2498
02:49:35,016 --> 02:49:38,040
MATT: One of them (bursting) (skittering).

2499
02:49:38,040 --> 02:49:40,214
MARISHA: Molly? Can you?

2500
02:49:40,214 --> 02:49:43,623
LAURA: Kill it with fire! I Sacred Flame it.

2501
02:49:43,623 --> 02:49:48,407
MATT: With a torch throwing and landing, and the
Sacred Flame igniting it, you watch as this

2502
02:49:48,407 --> 02:49:54,722
cluster begins to burn as these tiny white and
blue spiders begin to expand out the side. Some of

2503
02:49:54,722 --> 02:49:56,690
them make it up the sides of the wall.

2504
02:49:56,690 --> 02:50:00,243
TRAVIS: I hate spiders. I'm fucking out.

2505
02:50:00,243 --> 02:50:04,019
MATT: You rush up and like crush a couple of them.
Even baby-sized, they're about that big. They're

2506
02:50:04,019 --> 02:50:06,194
all coming up and they begin to burn.

2507
02:50:06,194 --> 02:50:07,910
LAURA: Got to kill them all!

2508
02:50:07,910 --> 02:50:13,545
MATT: You go and start burning. It appears you've
got them all. Some of them seem to have burned,

2509
02:50:13,545 --> 02:50:16,472
some of them seem to have vanished. It's hard to
tell.

2510
02:50:16,472 --> 02:50:24,213
TALIESIN: No, I hear the commotion and come
halfway over and nothing seems-- they're burning

2511
02:50:24,213 --> 02:50:25,211
spiders.

2512
02:50:25,211 --> 02:50:29,044
LIAM: Caleb is blithely burning over here and has
no idea what's going on behind him.

2513
02:50:29,044 --> 02:50:31,622
TALIESIN: You are checking the bodies for things,
right?

2514
02:50:31,622 --> 02:50:33,973
LIAM: Of course I am. I'm waiting for the DM to
fill in the blanks.

2515
02:50:33,973 --> 02:50:35,457
TALIESIN: Well that's fine, then.

2516
02:50:35,457 --> 02:50:39,181
MATT: If you go to the other bodies, you get two
sets of Crownsguard armor, and two longswords of

2517
02:50:39,181 --> 02:50:40,649
the Crownsguard.

2518
02:50:40,649 --> 02:50:42,834
ASHLEY: How much money was in the first two
purses?

2519
02:50:42,834 --> 02:50:45,248
TRAVIS: Oh, the pouches that you took?

2520
02:50:45,248 --> 02:50:54,977
MATT: Right, the total between those two was 15
gold, 60 silver, and 20 copper.

2521
02:50:57,187 --> 02:50:58,381
ASHLEY: Okay.

2522
02:50:59,392 --> 02:51:01,963
LAURA: Just keeping all that for yourself, then,
Yasha?

2523
02:51:01,963 --> 02:51:05,501
LIAM: That's five bodies. I don't know if I got
them all, but are there any coin purses as well?

2524
02:51:05,501 --> 02:51:09,320
MATT: You do, and you go through. It'll take you a
little while to go through all the bodies here, so

2525
02:51:09,320 --> 02:51:13,474
we'll get to see how many you get through here.

2526
02:51:13,474 --> 02:51:16,464
LAURA: Did you say two sets of armor? Would that
fit in the bag?

2527
02:51:16,464 --> 02:51:17,709
MATT: Hmm?

2528
02:51:17,709 --> 02:51:21,394
LAURA: Would that fit in the bag? Two sets of
armor?

2529
02:51:21,394 --> 02:51:28,566
MATT: Well, I believe it would because it is a
volume/space thing. It'll take up a lot of space

2530
02:51:28,566 --> 02:51:33,953
within the-- and you have two two-foot by two-foot
spaces on the two sides, and then you have the

2531
02:51:33,953 --> 02:51:37,772
main eight-foot cube section there, so.

2532
02:51:37,772 --> 02:51:42,423
LAURA: Okay, we'll bring these back to the
Crownsguard and hopefully get some reward.

2533
02:51:42,423 --> 02:51:53,382
MATT: You do find another pair of studded leather
armor that has like a sea motif to it. There's

2534
02:51:53,382 --> 02:52:04,659
shells pressed into it, and a wave pattern on the
edges. The person it's attached to has a bunch of

2535
02:52:04,659 --> 02:52:11,890
tattoos across their body as well, that insinuate
a lot of time at sea, different names of different

2536
02:52:11,890 --> 02:52:16,821
ships that are different points of faded on the
body. They may have been a sailor at some point in

2537
02:52:16,821 --> 02:52:19,274
their life and has expired under here.

2538
02:52:19,274 --> 02:52:21,787
LIAM: Yeah, I will quietly gather that up and put
it into my bag.

2539
02:52:21,787 --> 02:52:24,685
MATT: Okay. Well, the armor's a full set, so
it'll--

2540
02:52:24,685 --> 02:52:27,529
LIAM: Am I able to carry that? I don't even know.

2541
02:52:27,529 --> 02:52:33,553
MATT: Yeah, I mean, it's a leather chest plate,
leather arm bands and bracers, and then leg plates

2542
02:52:33,553 --> 02:52:37,995
as well, so it's a full set. You could probably
fit all that into your bag if it's the only thing

2543
02:52:37,995 --> 02:52:38,984
that's in your bag.

2544
02:52:38,984 --> 02:52:40,406
LIAM: Okay.

2545
02:52:40,406 --> 02:52:46,916
MATT: You stuff it all in there. Beyond that,
going through them, for the sake of brevity here,

2546
02:52:46,916 --> 02:52:53,360
you find an additional 85 gold pieces, 210 silver,
and 45 copper.

2547
02:52:53,360 --> 02:52:55,392
LIAM: 85-- what was it?

2548
02:52:55,392 --> 02:52:56,379
SAM and TRAVIS: Gold.

2549
02:52:56,379 --> 02:52:57,405
LIAM: Yeah. 85 gold.

2550
02:52:57,405 --> 02:52:59,926
MATT: 210 silver and 45 copper.

2551
02:52:59,926 --> 02:53:02,883
LAURA: Is everybody a greedy fuck in this game and
we just keep whatever?

2552
02:53:02,883 --> 02:53:04,905
LIAM: I am not telling you that I found that at
all.

2553
02:53:04,905 --> 02:53:06,947
LAURA: Cool.

2554
02:53:06,947 --> 02:53:08,401
TRAVIS: He dies first.

2555
02:53:10,392 --> 02:53:13,062
TALIESIN: We see him collecting everything,
anyway.

2556
02:53:13,062 --> 02:53:16,062
MATT: Yeah, while you guys are all talking to this
guy, Caleb is going from body to body, putting

2557
02:53:16,062 --> 02:53:18,442
everything in his pockets. He's not being sneaky.

2558
02:53:18,442 --> 02:53:20,564
CALEB: Yeah, but you're not standing like right
over, looking down. You see me feeling at the

2559
02:53:20,564 --> 02:53:21,369
bodies.

2560
02:53:21,369 --> 02:53:23,758
MARISHA: No, but we're all of the same breed; we
get what you're doing.

2561
02:53:23,758 --> 02:53:26,155
LIAM: You know I'm looking, but you don't know
what I found.

2562
02:53:26,155 --> 02:53:28,063
TALIESIN: We know you're going to lie about it.

2563
02:53:28,063 --> 02:53:29,262
MARISHA: Yeah.

2564
02:53:29,262 --> 02:53:31,336
LIAM: Sorry, because everyone is so lovely, can
you tell me--

2565
02:53:31,336 --> 02:53:32,487
TRAVIS: 85, 210--

2566
02:53:32,487 --> 02:53:34,008
LIAM: 85?

2567
02:53:34,008 --> 02:53:38,349
MATT: Gold pieces. 210 silver, and 45 copper.

2568
02:53:38,349 --> 02:53:39,451
LIAM: Okay.

2569
02:53:39,451 --> 02:53:42,301
LAURA: Vex never lied about the loot we found.

2570
02:53:42,301 --> 02:53:44,610
LIAM: I don't give a fuck what Vex did.

2571
02:53:44,610 --> 02:53:48,845
LAURA: Never once. Never once, for all the shit
she got for being greedy, she never once lied

2572
02:53:48,845 --> 02:53:49,961
about the loot.

2573
02:53:49,961 --> 02:53:51,245
TALIESIN: She was a good person.

2574
02:53:51,245 --> 02:53:52,314
SAM: Yes, but she was a horrible person.

2575
02:53:52,314 --> 02:53:53,272
ASHLEY: It's true.

2576
02:53:53,272 --> 02:53:54,305
LAURA: She's a terrible half-elf.

2577
02:53:54,305 --> 02:53:56,197
LIAM: Vex is retired in Whitestone right now.
She's not here.

2578
02:53:56,197 --> 02:53:58,679
MARISHA: I'm sensing a lingering sibling rivalry.

2579
02:53:58,679 --> 02:54:00,978
MATT: I know. It's carried over.

2580
02:54:00,978 --> 02:54:02,708
MARISHA: Hanging over the table.

2581
02:54:02,708 --> 02:54:05,804
LIAM: I'm clearly Lawful Good. Clearly.

2582
02:54:05,804 --> 02:54:08,460
MARISHA: What's Thed doing?

2583
02:54:08,460 --> 02:54:13,844
MATT: Well, he's checked all his things, and he
goes, "Okay, I thank you all so much for your

2584
02:54:13,979 --> 02:54:17,088
help. I really appreciate it. You've saved my
life."

2585
02:54:17,088 --> 02:54:22,142
MARISHA: I'm going to do that lean up against the
wall thing over the top of him.

2586
02:54:22,142 --> 02:54:25,150
MATT: Okay, as he's doing this, he smiles. You can
see he's missing two teeth to the side and he has

2587
02:54:25,150 --> 02:54:30,434
a septum piercing up in his nose that he rights
and pulls back down again so it's visible and he's

2588
02:54:30,434 --> 02:54:32,104
like, "(sniff) All right."

2589
02:54:32,104 --> 02:54:34,523
MARISHA: You real thankful?

2590
02:54:34,523 --> 02:54:37,030
MATT: "Yeah."

2591
02:54:37,030 --> 02:54:43,015
MARISHA: Real grateful? You feel like we did you a
good service today?

2592
02:54:43,015 --> 02:54:45,901
MATT: "I'd happily pay you, but your friend
already took all my money."

2593
02:54:45,901 --> 02:54:47,610
LAURA: I didn't take anything from you!

2594
02:54:47,610 --> 02:54:49,667
MARISHA: I just want one--

2595
02:54:49,667 --> 02:54:52,081
LAURA: I didn't take anything from his pockets.

2596
02:54:52,081 --> 02:54:53,339
MATT: That's what he's saying.

2597
02:54:53,339 --> 02:54:55,211
LAURA: (gasp)

2598
02:54:55,211 --> 02:55:00,316
MARISHA: I just want something in return. You
know, you provide a service, get something in

2599
02:55:00,316 --> 02:55:01,705
return, right?

2600
02:55:01,705 --> 02:55:03,950
MATT: "What-- if I can be of service, I'd be happy
to."

2601
02:55:03,950 --> 02:55:05,900
MARISHA: Who's the Gentleman?

2602
02:55:06,150 --> 02:55:07,647
SAM: Ooh.

2603
02:55:07,647 --> 02:55:10,103
MATT: "I don't know what you're talking about."

2604
02:55:10,103 --> 02:55:11,212
MARISHA: Oh, friend.

2605
02:55:11,406 --> 02:55:13,694
TALIESIN: I heard "Gentleman." I'm walking over.

2606
02:55:13,694 --> 02:55:16,359
MARISHA: Oh friend, I don't need to roll an
insight check to know that's bullshit.

2607
02:55:16,359 --> 02:55:25,264
MATT: "I apologize, I don't-- I apologize. I don't
know what you're talking about."

2608
02:55:25,264 --> 02:55:27,320
ASHLEY: Wait, was was it?

2609
02:55:27,320 --> 02:55:29,155
TALIESIN: Who's the Gentleman.

2610
02:55:29,155 --> 02:55:33,620
SAM: I'm going to get closer to Thed and say in
Thieves' Cant--

2611
02:55:33,620 --> 02:55:35,214
LIAM: Yes!

2612
02:55:35,214 --> 02:55:37,669
SAM: You can trust us. We're one of you.

2613
02:55:37,669 --> 02:55:39,666
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

2614
02:55:39,666 --> 02:55:41,139
LIAM: Yes!

2615
02:55:41,139 --> 02:55:42,394
SAM: Natural 20.

2616
02:55:42,507 --> 02:55:45,146
(cheering)

2617
02:55:45,146 --> 02:55:55,615
MATT: Oh, fuck! He glances down at you, looks
taken aback, and returns to you in Thieves' Cant

2618
02:55:55,615 --> 02:56:01,009
and says, "And the rest of your compatriots?"

2619
02:56:01,009 --> 02:56:03,562
SAM: They're cool.

2620
02:56:07,448 --> 02:56:19,713
MATT: Switching back to Common, he goes, "Look. I
cannot tell you anything, except for, if you want

2621
02:56:19,713 --> 02:56:29,235
to find him, there is a place you can inquire. If
I give you any more information and that gets

2622
02:56:29,235 --> 02:56:33,857
around, I am deader than that spider would have
left me."

2623
02:56:33,857 --> 02:56:37,582
MARISHA: All right. Where do I inquire?

2624
02:56:39,864 --> 02:56:48,731
MATT: He sighs for a second. "There's a dive,
naught but five blocks from here, called The

2625
02:56:48,731 --> 02:56:50,112
Evening Nip."

2626
02:56:50,112 --> 02:56:52,001
MARISHA: The Evening Nip.

2627
02:56:52,001 --> 02:56:53,382
SAM: We've heard that before!

2628
02:56:53,382 --> 02:56:54,958
LAURA: Yeah, it's in the letter!

2629
02:56:54,958 --> 02:56:56,982
MARISHA: All right.

2630
02:56:56,982 --> 02:57:07,651
MATT: "Don't say his name. Just walk up to the old
man behind the counter and mention you'd like a

2631
02:57:07,651 --> 02:57:15,339
drink, and while you have no coin, you'd be
willing to offer many gifts."

2632
02:57:15,339 --> 02:57:17,434
MARISHA: I'd like a drink--

2633
02:57:17,434 --> 02:57:21,242
TRAVIS: I have no coin, willing to offer many
gifts.

2634
02:57:21,242 --> 02:57:22,963
MARISHA: No coin.

2635
02:57:22,963 --> 02:57:34,023
MATT: "'Many gifts' is the important part. Now, I
hope that's been of service, and I-- as you seem

2636
02:57:34,023 --> 02:57:40,843
to be the types who see it fit to save a person
that you haven't met in the bottom of a terrible

2637
02:57:40,843 --> 02:57:46,469
sewer, I would hope that you would be kind enough
to know that that information did not come from

2638
02:57:46,469 --> 02:57:50,851
me, and that you've never seen me before in your
entire life."

2639
02:57:50,851 --> 02:57:51,894
TALIESIN: Oh.

2640
02:57:51,894 --> 02:57:53,170
MARISHA: What's your name?

2641
02:57:53,170 --> 02:57:55,185
LAURA: His name was Thed.

2642
02:57:55,185 --> 02:57:58,444
TALIESIN: Of course, friend, we've never seen you
before in our entire life.

2643
02:57:58,444 --> 02:58:01,664
MATT: "As I haven't seen you, either."

2644
02:58:01,664 --> 02:58:07,770
LAURA: I didn't take anything from your pockets. I
really didn't.

2645
02:58:07,770 --> 02:58:10,639
TALIESIN: Does anything about his tattoo irritate
me?

2646
02:58:10,639 --> 02:58:12,310
MATT: It's not very well done.

2647
02:58:12,310 --> 02:58:13,854
TALIESIN: You know what I mean.

2648
02:58:13,854 --> 02:58:15,089
MATT: Yeah. No.

2649
02:58:15,089 --> 02:58:16,400
TALIESIN: All right.

2650
02:58:16,400 --> 02:58:18,242
MATT: Okay.

2651
02:58:18,242 --> 02:58:23,494
LAURA: You really do have like a key to the
grates, like an extra one?

2652
02:58:23,494 --> 02:58:31,774
MATT: "I mean-- " He looks up behind him and says,
"I've got mine, but I need it for my work."

2653
02:58:31,774 --> 02:58:33,538
TALIESIN: That's fair.

2654
02:58:33,538 --> 02:58:35,628
TRAVIS: Pretty sure we can call for someone with
our--

2655
02:58:35,628 --> 02:58:41,383
MATT: He glances over towards Nott and says,
"Unless I'm mistaken, it appears you have a female

2656
02:58:41,383 --> 02:58:45,475
friend here who could probably help you get around
that anyway."

2657
02:58:45,475 --> 02:58:47,223
SAM: I could try.

2658
02:58:47,223 --> 02:58:56,631
MATT: "Anyway. I bid you all adieu." He pulls
his hood up over his head and his little halfling

2659
02:58:56,631 --> 02:58:59,472
feet quickly carry him back in the direction where
you guys travel the sewer.

2660
02:58:59,472 --> 02:59:01,121
SAM: Watch out for poo rats!

2661
02:59:01,121 --> 02:59:03,220
MATT: (distant yell) "I'm aware!"

2662
02:59:03,220 --> 02:59:12,039
TRAVIS: How many of these victims were other than
crownsguard? Any civilians or women, children?

2663
02:59:12,039 --> 02:59:18,523
MATT: No children. One of them appears to be a
woman in her 40s or so. A lot of them appear to be

2664
02:59:18,523 --> 02:59:23,771
dressed in heavy leathers. They may have been
either coming through to try to clear up parts of

2665
02:59:23,771 --> 02:59:29,248
the sewer; some of them look very poor, and may
have come down here in hopes of scavenging

2666
02:59:29,248 --> 02:59:35,602
whatever had fallen down into the sewer and
collected over time. Some of them appear to be

2667
02:59:35,602 --> 02:59:43,772
similarly dressed as Thed, or at least have a
somewhat skulking-type demeanor about their

2668
02:59:43,772 --> 02:59:46,288
wares.

2669
02:59:46,288 --> 02:59:50,152
MARISHA: Anybody have any neck tattoos that look
like serpents?

2670
02:59:50,152 --> 02:59:58,138
MATT: No. There are a handful that look like they
probably have traveled this route before and got

2671
02:59:58,138 --> 02:59:59,551
caught up in it.

2672
03:00:01,363 --> 03:00:03,269
TRAVIS: Well, what did you find on the bodies?
Sorry.

2673
03:00:03,269 --> 03:00:07,307
MARISHA: No-- are-- go ahead.

2674
03:00:07,307 --> 03:00:09,980
TRAVIS: Yeah. What did we find?

2675
03:00:09,980 --> 03:00:12,834
LIAM: There was a bunch of weapons and armor.

2676
03:00:13,704 --> 03:00:15,218
TRAVIS: Nice.

2677
03:00:15,828 --> 03:00:18,538
TALIESIN: And some coin.

2678
03:00:18,538 --> 03:00:22,582
TRAVIS: Anything unique? Any unique things?

2679
03:00:22,582 --> 03:00:24,759
TALIESIN: Why don't we get into some daylight and
take a look?

2680
03:00:24,759 --> 03:00:26,558
TRAVIS: Sure.

2681
03:00:26,558 --> 03:00:29,794
LIAM: We should reconnoiter to look at what we
have.

2682
03:00:29,794 --> 03:00:34,907
LAURA: Anything else interesting in the room,
outside of the bodies?

2683
03:00:34,907 --> 03:00:41,739
MATT: Outside of the bodies? It looks like there
is broken bits of what would have been furniture

2684
03:00:41,739 --> 03:00:48,713
or a cart at some time that got discarded or
shoved down here from above. Other than that, just

2685
03:00:48,713 --> 03:00:50,976
the general refuse you've come across down here in
the sewer.

2686
03:00:50,976 --> 03:00:52,513
TALIESIN: We do have a spider body to pick.

2687
03:00:52,513 --> 03:00:56,850
TRAVIS: Can I happen to see-- am I able to see the
guy with all the tattoos of ships and stuff?

2688
03:00:56,850 --> 03:00:58,838
MATT: Yeah, you see him.

2689
03:00:58,838 --> 03:01:04,253
TRAVIS: Oh, cool. Do I recognize any of the names
of ships, or any imagery?

2690
03:01:04,253 --> 03:01:06,314
MATT: Make an investigation check on that.

2691
03:01:10,174 --> 03:01:12,164
TRAVIS: Ugh. 11.

2692
03:01:12,164 --> 03:01:18,315
MATT: Okay. Looking about them, and what you can
rummage through, he's pretty much naked other than

2693
03:01:18,315 --> 03:01:26,495
his underoos. Looking through, there's like the
Midnight Lorry, you don't recognize that name at

2694
03:01:26,495 --> 03:01:34,047
all; there's one of them that's the Shell Carrier,
don't recognize that one. There's one name that

2695
03:01:34,047 --> 03:01:41,628
catches your attention; it was called the Pink
Giver, and it came through your ports at one

2696
03:01:41,628 --> 03:01:49,602
point. You remember it coming into port, you were
paid to take care of it, offload things, back on--

2697
03:01:49,602 --> 03:02:01,848
The name itself was derived by a wooden carving at
the front bow of the ship that was of a mermaid

2698
03:02:01,848 --> 03:02:08,298
with her arms extended that was gifting a human
heart that was painted with this vibrant pink

2699
03:02:08,298 --> 03:02:17,237
color that was its signifying visual. Yeah. Other
than that, nothing particular about it, just that

2700
03:02:17,237 --> 03:02:19,556
you were like, "Oh yes, I know that ship."

2701
03:02:19,556 --> 03:02:20,826
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2702
03:02:20,826 --> 03:02:22,807
ASHLEY: Is the Broken Howl on there?

2703
03:02:22,807 --> 03:02:24,978
LAURA: Aww.

2704
03:02:28,111 --> 03:02:30,084
MATT: It's on the back.

2705
03:02:30,245 --> 03:02:32,673
LIAM: Throwback!

2706
03:02:32,673 --> 03:02:34,791
ASHLEY: That looks like a piece of shit ship.

2707
03:02:34,791 --> 03:02:36,734
(laughter)

2708
03:02:36,734 --> 03:02:39,545
TALIESIN: (sings) Continuity. Roll for
continuity.

2709
03:02:39,545 --> 03:02:41,846
MARISHA: Beau turns to Nott. Hey girl.

2710
03:02:41,846 --> 03:02:43,514
SAM: Yeah.

2711
03:02:43,514 --> 03:02:45,564
MARISHA: That little code you were talking.

2712
03:02:45,564 --> 03:02:46,973
SAM: (clicks tongue)

2713
03:02:46,973 --> 03:02:50,312
MARISHA: See any of that written around these
walls, or something that looks similar to it?

2714
03:02:50,312 --> 03:02:53,622
SAM: I can look around. Thieves' Cant is a written
or spoken thing?

2715
03:02:53,704 --> 03:02:54,451
LAURA: Both.

2716
03:02:54,451 --> 03:03:03,816
MATT: It's almost universally spoken, and as a
language it's used for extended ciphers. Make an

2717
03:03:03,816 --> 03:03:04,924
investigation check.

2718
03:03:04,924 --> 03:03:08,364
MARISHA: Can I help him out, see if I spot
anything? Give him an assisted roll?

2719
03:03:08,364 --> 03:03:09,937
MATT: You can, if you want to assist him.

2720
03:03:09,937 --> 03:03:10,954
SAM: 19.

2721
03:03:10,954 --> 03:03:12,553
MATT: You have advantage on it because she's
helping you.

2722
03:03:12,553 --> 03:03:13,838
SAM: 19.

2723
03:03:13,838 --> 03:03:20,379
MATT: Okay. Glancing about, you can see behind the
rungs, there's about a two-inch gap across the

2724
03:03:20,379 --> 03:03:29,675
wall. There is a very, very faint scratch into it
that says, although not referring directly to

2725
03:03:29,675 --> 03:03:31,302
yours, it says "Money pot."

2726
03:03:31,302 --> 03:03:32,574
MARISHA: Money pot?

2727
03:03:32,574 --> 03:03:33,580
MATT: Yes.

2728
03:03:33,580 --> 03:03:36,725
SAM: (whispers) Money pot? (louder) It says,
"Money pot!"

2729
03:03:36,725 --> 03:03:39,801
MATT: Which catches you off-guard, because you're
like, "That's one of our--"

2730
03:03:39,801 --> 03:03:42,210
SAM: That's one of our one-shots!

2731
03:03:42,210 --> 03:03:44,982
MARISHA: What, what?

2732
03:03:44,982 --> 03:03:49,807
SAM: That's one of our things, but that's not-- it
can't-- it's not us. We weren't down here before,

2733
03:03:49,807 --> 03:03:50,783
were we?

2734
03:03:50,783 --> 03:03:51,793
TRAVIS: Insight check.

2735
03:03:51,793 --> 03:03:53,709
(laughter)

2736
03:03:53,709 --> 03:03:59,410
LAURA: I wonder if this grate leads up into the
Tri-Spires, then. Maybe it means lots of rich

2737
03:03:59,410 --> 03:04:00,866
people are up here.

2738
03:04:00,866 --> 03:04:04,630
SAM: Maybe. Maybe this is the name-- maybe they've
named all the entrances and exits or something

2739
03:04:04,630 --> 03:04:05,551
like that.

2740
03:04:05,551 --> 03:04:08,645
LAURA: Maybe. Easy pickings.

2741
03:04:08,645 --> 03:04:10,946
TALIESIN: Maybe they buried something here.

2742
03:04:10,946 --> 03:04:15,392
LAURA: If they don't allow the criminals in, then
they'd be real easy to pickpocket, because no one

2743
03:04:15,392 --> 03:04:16,512
would expect it.

2744
03:04:16,512 --> 03:04:17,716
MARISHA: Yeah.

2745
03:04:17,716 --> 03:04:19,405
TRAVIS: One way to find out.

2746
03:04:19,405 --> 03:04:22,946
SAM: Should we try to jimmy this lock and get
out?

2747
03:04:22,946 --> 03:04:24,814
LAURA: Well, we can probably call up. We have the
writ.

2748
03:04:24,814 --> 03:04:28,865
SAM: Okay. Well, do we need to get the spider
first?

2749
03:04:28,865 --> 03:04:30,829
LAURA: Well, it's all tied up. Me and Yasha can
probably--

2750
03:04:30,829 --> 03:04:32,058
ASHLEY: We got it, yeah.

2751
03:04:32,058 --> 03:04:34,013
MARISHA: I'll put a little bundle on my staff as
well.

2752
03:04:34,013 --> 03:04:39,755
LIAM: Jester, will you come look at my eyes? They
feel a little bloodshot, I'm not feeling well

2753
03:04:39,755 --> 03:04:43,654
after my encounter with the rats.

2754
03:04:43,654 --> 03:04:49,575
LAURA: Sure. I put my hands on either side of his
face. Can I see anything weird?

2755
03:04:49,575 --> 03:04:51,281
LIAM: Wait, come over here.

2756
03:04:51,281 --> 03:04:52,802
TALIESIN: I'm walking over with this, too.

2757
03:04:52,802 --> 03:04:55,419
LIAM: Come over here. I walk away from the group.

2758
03:04:55,419 --> 03:04:56,676
LAURA: Okay.

2759
03:04:56,676 --> 03:04:57,915
LIAM: I don't know if she follows me or not.

2760
03:04:57,915 --> 03:04:59,401
LAURA: I do, I do.

2761
03:04:59,401 --> 03:05:10,440
LIAM: There was gold in there. I would like you to
have it. It's more than I had before. Here is 100

2762
03:05:10,440 --> 03:05:13,543
gold were on those people, so you take it because
I know that you need money.

2763
03:05:13,543 --> 03:05:15,541
LAURA: Caleb, I don't--

2764
03:05:15,541 --> 03:05:23,729
LIAM: I know that you need money, and I'm very,
you know, look at this. And I do a little joke.

2765
03:05:23,729 --> 03:05:25,423
LAURA: Those are really, really strong.

2766
03:05:25,423 --> 03:05:31,422
LIAM: That's sad and funny at the same time. You
carry the gold, because I can't carry it all.

2767
03:05:31,422 --> 03:05:35,408
LAURA: Okay, but I'm not keeping it just for me,
you know.

2768
03:05:35,408 --> 03:05:36,910
LIAM: That's fine.

2769
03:05:36,910 --> 03:05:38,279
LAURA: It's for both of us.

2770
03:05:38,279 --> 03:05:43,453
LIAM: Well, that's why you wanted money, I assume,
from your mother, was to help us out in the

2771
03:05:43,453 --> 03:05:44,926
position we're in.

2772
03:05:44,926 --> 03:05:45,924
LAURA: Of course.

2773
03:05:45,924 --> 03:05:50,926
LIAM: Yeah, so you take this, you're a better, you
know, I'm always thinking about things, and I'm

2774
03:05:50,926 --> 03:05:55,975
not very good with amounts and money. So you carry
it.

2775
03:05:55,975 --> 03:06:05,392
LAURA: Caleb. Thank you. And I'm sorry.

2776
03:06:05,392 --> 03:06:14,603
LIAM: You know, I just had a really bad day today,
that's all it was. I guess I'm sorry as well.

2777
03:06:14,603 --> 03:06:24,693
LAURA: Do you need curing, though? Because your
eyes do look bloodshot.

2778
03:06:24,693 --> 03:06:30,339
LIAM: No, that was, I'm fine. I'm going to stare
at the wall because I don't know how to deal with

2779
03:06:30,339 --> 03:06:32,337
attention very well.

2780
03:06:32,337 --> 03:06:35,354
MATT: While this is happening, what are you guys
doing?

2781
03:06:35,354 --> 03:06:39,222
TALIESIN: I'm waiting for them to break up, and I
suppose we're packing the spider up to bring topside.

2782
03:06:39,222 --> 03:06:41,504
ASHLEY: I really hide the money that I found.

2783
03:06:41,504 --> 03:06:50,998
SAM: I'm taking at least one button off of every
single person in the--

2784
03:06:50,998 --> 03:06:55,210
MATT: Easy enough to do. You have quite a
collection going.

2785
03:06:55,210 --> 03:06:56,510
SAM: Yeah.

2786
03:06:56,510 --> 03:06:58,703
TRAVIS: I'm just waiting.

2787
03:06:58,703 --> 03:07:03,373
MATT: You guys have reconvened, you've gathered
your things, the spider has been-- all the legs

2788
03:07:03,373 --> 03:07:09,953
have been pulled up and wrapped and you have
either Beau's staff or something else to lift it

2789
03:07:09,953 --> 03:07:14,072
with on both sides, because it's pretty heavy,
it's going to take two of you to carry.

2790
03:07:14,072 --> 03:07:15,650
LAURA: All right, we'll carry it.

2791
03:07:15,650 --> 03:07:16,627
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2792
03:07:16,627 --> 03:07:20,925
MATT: It would have to be you two, it's pretty
strong. The two of you lift it.

2793
03:07:20,925 --> 03:07:22,433
ASHLEY: Are we the strongest?

2794
03:07:22,433 --> 03:07:23,509
LAURA: Oh my gosh, yes.

2795
03:07:23,509 --> 03:07:24,331
ASHLEY: Oh!

2796
03:07:24,331 --> 03:07:25,972
(laughter)

2797
03:07:25,972 --> 03:07:28,345
MATT: So where are you guys going?

2798
03:07:28,345 --> 03:07:30,020
LAURA: Because you have a big lollipop to carry.

2799
03:07:30,020 --> 03:07:31,385
SAM: We've got to go up.

2800
03:07:31,385 --> 03:07:33,280
LAURA: Up these things, into the money pot.

2801
03:07:33,280 --> 03:07:35,592
MATT: Okay. So. Who's going first?

2802
03:07:35,592 --> 03:07:36,859
TRAVIS: Nott?

2803
03:07:36,859 --> 03:07:39,465
LAURA: Well, somebody that can talk to the
guards.

2804
03:07:39,465 --> 03:07:42,471
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Nott.

2805
03:07:42,471 --> 03:07:51,330
SAM: I don't know, guys. All right, I'll try.
(shouting) Hello? We're stuck down here, and we

2806
03:07:51,330 --> 03:07:55,103
want to come up. Let us out of the sewers. Let us
up!

2807
03:07:55,103 --> 03:08:00,715
MATT: As you climb up, Nott, and look through, the
sun has set, and the night has gone purple to

2808
03:08:00,715 --> 03:08:06,592
dark, navy blue as night has taken it. You glance
up through and you're looking out into a dark

2809
03:08:06,592 --> 03:08:15,389
alleyway. You see two sides of an alley, shaded
and dark. About maybe 25 feet ahead, it opens up

2810
03:08:15,389 --> 03:08:21,233
into a fine cobblestone road. You can see fine
buildings across the way, you see the lanterns are

2811
03:08:21,233 --> 03:08:25,932
light in the center of the town. You have not been
to this part of the town, but it's pretty well

2812
03:08:25,932 --> 03:08:30,067
kept, and no one seems to be immediately around to
hear you.

2813
03:08:30,067 --> 03:08:32,120
LAURA: Is it locked?

2814
03:08:32,120 --> 03:08:33,493
MATT: It is locked.

2815
03:08:33,493 --> 03:08:35,348
LAURA: Can you pick the lock?

2816
03:08:35,348 --> 03:08:36,685
SAM: Oh, yeah.

2817
03:08:36,685 --> 03:08:39,749
MATT: Go ahead and make a lock picking check.

2818
03:08:39,749 --> 03:08:41,839
SAM: What is that, sleight of hand?

2819
03:08:41,839 --> 03:08:46,979
MATT: No, it's your thieves' tools, so your
proficiency bonus plus your dex bonus.

2820
03:08:46,979 --> 03:08:51,590
SAM: Dex bonus is four, proficiency is three, plus
12 is--

2821
03:08:51,590 --> 03:08:52,921
MATT: Well, two, isn't it?

2822
03:08:52,921 --> 03:08:54,108
LAURA: Yeah, I think it's just two right now.

2823
03:08:54,108 --> 03:08:55,211
SAM: Oh, it's just two? Okay.

2824
03:08:55,211 --> 03:08:56,492
MATT: It'd be six.

2825
03:08:56,492 --> 03:08:57,539
SAM: 18.

2826
03:08:57,539 --> 03:09:05,165
MATT: 18. It takes a moment, and you have to reach
around the other side and it opens up, and the

2827
03:09:05,165 --> 03:09:12,134
bars push open. The gap here, into the back of
this alleyway, is about two feet tall. Each of you

2828
03:09:12,134 --> 03:09:15,327
can get out comfortably. That spider is going to
need some squeezing.

2829
03:09:15,327 --> 03:09:16,879
TALIESIN: We'll give it a push.

2830
03:09:16,879 --> 03:09:21,778
SAM: We can move it up first.

2831
03:09:21,778 --> 03:09:28,963
MATT: You guys, one by one, get up back topside.
You manage to push it through. It damages the

2832
03:09:28,963 --> 03:09:34,447
body, parts of it break and slide off, it's not
designed to fill through that space, but it's

2833
03:09:34,447 --> 03:09:35,823
still mostly intact.

2834
03:09:35,823 --> 03:09:37,834
MARISHA: I'm imagining the Play-doh fun
factories.

2835
03:09:37,834 --> 03:09:43,780
MATT: Not quite that bad, but it definitely
doesn't look as pretty on the other side.

2836
03:09:43,780 --> 03:09:51,542
TALIESIN: I hang back for a second, and I very
quickly, gently, socially pin Caleb to the wall.

2837
03:09:51,542 --> 03:09:55,244
Face to face, as awkwardly close as I can get.

2838
03:09:55,244 --> 03:09:57,181
LIAM: I am definitely not looking you in the eye.

2839
03:09:57,181 --> 03:10:04,190
TALIESIN: No, you're not. Hey, Caleb. I'm fine if
you skim something off the top, that's fair, but

2840
03:10:04,190 --> 03:10:14,010
be clever about it. Just distribute 60 or 70
percent of what you find, okay? Good boy. Give him

2841
03:10:14,010 --> 03:10:16,207
a little slap on the face, and then I go up.

2842
03:10:16,207 --> 03:10:21,019
LIAM: Nothing from me.

2843
03:10:21,019 --> 03:10:28,100
MATT: So you all eventually gather up at the top,
street side. It's completely dark, the night sky

2844
03:10:28,100 --> 03:10:32,032
is above you, you can see the warm lantern light
across the various street intersections, and along

2845
03:10:32,032 --> 03:10:37,722
the path in front of the various buildings. You
definitely recognize this, Jester. This is indeed

2846
03:10:37,722 --> 03:10:39,195
the Tri-Spires district.

2847
03:10:39,195 --> 03:10:42,348
LAURA: Hey you guys, this is where my hotel is.

2848
03:10:42,348 --> 03:10:47,390
TRAVIS: Oh. Well, wasn't the plan to have a, what
did you call it?

2849
03:10:47,390 --> 03:10:49,361
MARISHA: (shouting) Room party!

2850
03:10:49,361 --> 03:10:50,940
LIAM: What time of the day is it?

2851
03:10:50,940 --> 03:10:52,693
MATT: It is night, it is freshly night.

2852
03:10:52,693 --> 03:10:55,127
LIAM: But what time of the day is it, because I
know.

2853
03:10:55,127 --> 03:10:56,683
TALIESIN: Party time.

2854
03:10:56,683 --> 03:11:00,885
LIAM: Very, very close to what time it is. I know
sundown, sunup.

2855
03:11:00,885 --> 03:11:07,399
MATT: Yeah, it's sundown. I'd say with the time it
took you to scavenge the bodies, about 30 or 40

2856
03:11:07,399 --> 03:11:09,804
minutes after the sun's set completely.

2857
03:11:09,804 --> 03:11:11,528
LIAM: What time does the sun set?

2858
03:11:11,528 --> 03:11:13,317
TRAVIS: Oh Jesus Christ. Garmin over here.

2859
03:11:13,317 --> 03:11:15,743
LAURA: Are you trying to figure out if the stores
are still open?

2860
03:11:15,743 --> 03:11:17,392
LIAM: Does it look dark? Of course I am.

2861
03:11:17,392 --> 03:11:20,389
MARISHA: We can't ask Siri here, we don't know.

2862
03:11:20,389 --> 03:11:28,053
LIAM: That's the feat I took. It's Siri. Does it
look like stores are open? That's all I'm asking.

2863
03:11:28,053 --> 03:11:34,582
MATT: Yeah, probably. I mean, in this district,
shops are still open past sundown for a little

2864
03:11:34,582 --> 03:11:38,087
bit, but the later in the evening it gets, many of
them close down. Some shops stay open later, you

2865
03:11:38,087 --> 03:11:39,032
don't know.

2866
03:11:39,032 --> 03:11:40,781
LIAM: Let's go to this room party you are talking
about.

2867
03:11:40,781 --> 03:11:48,258
SAM: Wait, to get the spider inside the hotel,
we'll need a clever disguise for it. A hat, a

2868
03:11:48,258 --> 03:11:49,897
beard, perhaps.

2869
03:11:49,897 --> 03:11:53,942
LAURA: Good call. I'll get out my disguise kit and
put a mustache on the spider.

2870
03:11:53,942 --> 03:11:59,615
LIAM: Also, Nott, mask up for sure, yeah? For
sure. Maybe earmuffs, it's very cold.

2871
03:11:59,615 --> 03:12:03,984
SAM: I could do a spell and make myself look like
someone else.

2872
03:12:03,984 --> 03:12:09,984
LIAM: That did not work very well for me several
hours ago, I think maybe you want to use tangible

2873
03:12:09,984 --> 03:12:13,954
things here. Use the earmuffs, use the hat, use
the mask.

2874
03:12:13,954 --> 03:12:17,449
SAM: Mask and earmuffs should make me look just
perfect.

2875
03:12:17,449 --> 03:12:22,784
LIAM: You also have a hood, so it's nighttime,
with the hood up, in the dark, yeah?

2876
03:12:22,784 --> 03:12:23,830
SAM: I like it.

2877
03:12:23,830 --> 03:12:25,929
LAURA: It's really bright and shiny in the hotel,
though.

2878
03:12:25,929 --> 03:12:30,844
TRAVIS: If I may, you raise a good point, Nott. If
we for some reason get caught being where we're

2879
03:12:30,844 --> 03:12:35,821
not supposed to, I think that writ only allows us
to kill this beast and return it for the coin.

2880
03:12:35,821 --> 03:12:37,478
LIAM: Yeah, we're not supposed to be here.

2881
03:12:37,478 --> 03:12:45,732
TRAVIS: I would not want to gamble with our reward
of 700 gold. Perhaps we should leave and collect

2882
03:12:45,732 --> 03:12:49,301
our reward and then find our revelries elsewhere.

2883
03:12:49,301 --> 03:12:53,577
MARISHA: I mean, to be fair, we know how to get
here through the sewers now, we can always come back.

2884
03:12:53,577 --> 03:12:54,944
TRAVIS: This is a good point.

2885
03:12:54,944 --> 03:12:59,400
LAURA: Should we just make it straight--

2886
03:12:59,400 --> 03:13:01,013
MARISHA: Make a beeline?

2887
03:13:01,013 --> 03:13:02,758
LAURA: Just go straight and just stay.

2888
03:13:02,758 --> 03:13:03,784
TRAVIS: We can walk.

2889
03:13:03,784 --> 03:13:08,105
LAURA: Yeah, let's go straight out and leave and
go to the Crownsguard.

2890
03:13:08,105 --> 03:13:09,530
TRAVIS: Yeah, the King's Hall.

2891
03:13:09,530 --> 03:13:10,518
MARISHA: Let's do it.

2892
03:13:10,518 --> 03:13:15,132
LAURA: Maybe we should shut the gate up and then
lock it.

2893
03:13:15,132 --> 03:13:16,281
SAM: Good idea.

2894
03:13:16,281 --> 03:13:17,349
LAURA: So they don't know.

2895
03:13:17,349 --> 03:13:26,398
MATT: So you remark it, you close it. You guys
step out into the main street, and you've traveled

2896
03:13:26,398 --> 03:13:29,788
through here before, you immediately think, oh
that's where the nearest exit gate in the

2897
03:13:29,788 --> 03:13:34,734
direction of the hall would be. You guys get about
a block before two of the patrolling crownsguard

2898
03:13:34,734 --> 03:13:42,005
stop and look at this troupe of people walking
with a giant, brutalized spider, bright white and blue.

2899
03:13:42,005 --> 03:13:43,446
TRAVIS: Dinner.

2900
03:13:43,446 --> 03:13:51,705
MATT: Immediately jogs up, both of them. "Excuse
me, what are you doing here?"

2901
03:13:51,705 --> 03:13:57,173
LAURA: Oh yes, don't worry, we're staying at the
Pillow Trove, but we have this very beautiful writ.

2902
03:13:57,173 --> 03:14:02,036
MATT: Takes the writ, and they both look at it.
The other one has his hand on the side of his

2903
03:14:02,036 --> 03:14:11,521
blade, each looking very closely at each of you.
And you are a motley lot. Going through all of

2904
03:14:11,521 --> 03:14:16,157
you, sneering a bit in the direction of Caleb.

2905
03:14:16,157 --> 03:14:17,417
LIAM: I have a hood on.

2906
03:14:17,417 --> 03:14:28,100
MATT: Yeah. A bit frightened at the vision of
Yasha, and confused at the sight of Mollymauk. He

2907
03:14:28,100 --> 03:14:34,930
finishes reading the writ. "Okay, very well, but
we will escort you to the gates and you can

2908
03:14:34,930 --> 03:14:36,554
"continue this on to the hall."

2909
03:14:36,554 --> 03:14:37,855
LAURA: Thank you!

2910
03:14:37,855 --> 03:14:40,162
MATT: "How did you get this in here?"

2911
03:14:40,162 --> 03:14:42,364
LAURA: Oh, we are really powerful.

2912
03:14:42,364 --> 03:14:43,798
MARISHA: We're the Mighty Nein.

2913
03:14:43,798 --> 03:14:48,511
LAURA: We killed it! We took care of the monster
problem.

2914
03:14:48,511 --> 03:14:54,500
MATT: Looks back at the other guard, and they
share a brief glance. "Right, very well. Let us

2915
03:14:54,500 --> 03:15:00,350
"leave, then." They escort you towards the
entrance. The opening gate where you guys had

2916
03:15:00,350 --> 03:15:07,207
passed through, you move through and out into the
Interstead Sprawl, at the exact gates where you

2917
03:15:07,207 --> 03:15:09,848
guys had entered, or you had entered, and you had
attempted the night before.

2918
03:15:09,848 --> 03:15:13,713
LIAM: Yeah, on the way there, too, I also turn to
one of these guards and say, excuse me, could you

2919
03:15:13,713 --> 03:15:21,055
point me where we are, right now, which way to the
Nestled Nook from here. You've heard of this bookstore?

2920
03:15:21,055 --> 03:15:24,917
MATT: "I didn't, well, the Nestled Nook, did you
say?"

2921
03:15:24,917 --> 03:15:26,974
LIAM: You don't have to pretend with me, it's
fine.

2922
03:15:26,974 --> 03:15:34,313
MATT: He points over that way, he goes, "To the
south side of the Silken Terrace, look for the

2923
03:15:34,313 --> 03:15:39,216
"small greenish hut-looking building."

2924
03:15:39,216 --> 03:15:41,077
LIAM: Thank you.

2925
03:15:41,077 --> 03:15:47,590
LAURA: We're going to clean up, we'll be back.
This is not normally how we dress, ugh, we were in

2926
03:15:47,590 --> 03:15:48,923
the sewers.

2927
03:15:48,923 --> 03:15:55,690
MATT: They escort you out. (laughs) Get you
quickly out of the district carrying a giant,

2928
03:15:55,763 --> 03:15:59,936
bloodied, awful-looking spider. As you're making
your way, some of the folks that are walking

2929
03:15:59,936 --> 03:16:04,890
through start gasping at the sight, and whispering
to each other, pointing. Some begin to approach,

2930
03:16:04,890 --> 03:16:09,760
and somebody else grabs their shoulder, and pulls
them back. You become this slow-moving sight

2931
03:16:09,760 --> 03:16:11,343
through this district.

2932
03:16:11,343 --> 03:16:15,852
TRAVIS: Yeah, Mighty Nein, stay back. Nein.

2933
03:16:15,852 --> 03:16:17,872
(laughter)

2934
03:16:17,872 --> 03:16:21,971
MATT: All right, you guys eventually make your way
back to the hall.

2935
03:16:21,971 --> 03:16:25,196
LIAM: You know, I grew up with this language.

2936
03:16:25,196 --> 03:16:27,857
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2937
03:16:27,857 --> 03:16:34,302
MATT: So you're outside the King's Hall. As you
approach, some of the guards rush up to you and,

2938
03:16:34,302 --> 03:16:39,438
"Hail! What do you carry and bring here to the--
What is this thing?"

2939
03:16:39,438 --> 03:16:42,480
TALIESIN: These papers? Oh, that's a spider.

2940
03:16:42,480 --> 03:16:45,503
LAURA: The evil monster that was killing
everything.

2941
03:16:45,503 --> 03:16:51,238
MARISHA: Yeah, you might want to send someone to
collect your dead too, by the by.

2942
03:16:51,238 --> 03:16:52,813
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Quite a few.

2943
03:16:52,813 --> 03:16:58,903
MATT: You bring him in. Some more of the guards
begin to gather around and then Voloshin is pulled

2944
03:16:58,903 --> 03:17:03,786
from his interior office somewhere. As he steps
forward he says, "All right, they tell me--oh,

2945
03:17:03,786 --> 03:17:12,159
"goodness me! That's a beastie." He tugs on the end
of his chin beard for a second. "So this is it,

2946
03:17:12,159 --> 03:17:13,436
"this is the one?"

2947
03:17:13,436 --> 03:17:18,027
TRAVIS: Indeed, in fact it would turn invisible
when it wasn't trying to stick its fangs into all

2948
03:17:18,027 --> 03:17:19,892
of our gang.

2949
03:17:19,892 --> 03:17:22,069
MATT: (shouting) "Someone wake up Cloen!"

2950
03:17:22,069 --> 03:17:23,982
MARISHA: Who the hell is Cloyde?

2951
03:17:23,982 --> 03:17:26,042
MATT: "Cloen, and he was the one survived--"

2952
03:17:26,042 --> 03:17:27,233
MARISHA: Cloyde?

2953
03:17:27,233 --> 03:17:29,942
MATT: Cloen.

2954
03:17:29,942 --> 03:17:32,421
ASHLEY: Cloyne?

2955
03:17:32,421 --> 03:17:34,189
MARISHA: Cloine.

2956
03:17:34,189 --> 03:17:35,279
MATT: Clo-en.

2957
03:17:35,279 --> 03:17:36,684
MARISHA: That is not what I heard at all.

2958
03:17:36,684 --> 03:17:38,191
TRAVIS: With that accent, all those letters
disappear.

2959
03:17:38,191 --> 03:17:39,695
TALIESIN: There's also an egg sac that got taken
care of.

2960
03:17:39,695 --> 03:17:43,425
LAURA: Oh my gosh, lots and lots and lots of baby
spiders.

2961
03:17:43,425 --> 03:17:48,181
MATT: He goes to the other guards, "Go down there,
double check, make sure everything is good, go."

2962
03:17:48,181 --> 03:17:52,558
Eventually you watch as another guard is brought
in. He has a night shirt on, and he looks

2963
03:17:52,633 --> 03:17:59,464
like he was woken up, he's a little drowsy.
"What's going on, I-- oh! That thing, that's the

2964
03:17:59,464 --> 03:18:04,886
"thing!" He looks immediately scared. He
goes, "Great, send him back to bed. Well, that's

2965
03:18:04,988 --> 03:18:06,669
"what we needed."

2966
03:18:06,669 --> 03:18:13,909
MARISHA: Send him back to bed? You should let that
guy go for leave for medical absence, that's

2967
03:18:13,909 --> 03:18:15,554
rough, man.

2968
03:18:15,554 --> 03:18:20,217
MATT: "You look like just the person I would take
advice from when it comes to administrating my people."

2969
03:18:20,217 --> 03:18:21,595
TRAVIS: Don't punch him, don't, no.

2970
03:18:21,595 --> 03:18:25,077
MARISHA: No, he's got a fair point. I'll give him
that.

2971
03:18:25,077 --> 03:18:27,957
TALIESIN: You don't look like an administrator, I
mean, that's actually almost a compliment.

2972
03:18:27,957 --> 03:18:31,393
MARISHA: You know, yeah, it's fair.

2973
03:18:31,393 --> 03:18:36,154
MATT: "I'm impressed, I will go ahead and retrieve
your payments to the Mighty Seven."

2974
03:18:36,154 --> 03:18:40,282
LAURA and TRAVIS: Nein.

2975
03:18:40,282 --> 03:18:42,285
TRAVIS: We lost two in the sewers.

2976
03:18:42,334 --> 03:18:44,750
(laughter)

2977
03:18:44,750 --> 03:18:47,246
MATT: "I'm sorry to hear that, that's terrible."

2978
03:18:47,246 --> 03:18:50,572
TALIESIN: Extra pay would soften the blow.

2979
03:18:50,572 --> 03:18:51,954
MATT: Make a deception check.

2980
03:18:51,954 --> 03:18:53,560
(laughter)

2981
03:18:53,560 --> 03:18:59,008
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. I'm moderately okay at this! Oh
no!

2982
03:18:59,008 --> 03:19:02,188
MARISHA: Oh, come on! Oh, it's not too bad.

2983
03:19:02,188 --> 03:19:05,971
TRAVIS: Okay, deception, where the fuck is it? Oh,
it's 11.

2984
03:19:05,971 --> 03:19:15,592
MATT: He goes, "That's really too bad. Anyway,
I'll be right back."

2985
03:19:15,592 --> 03:19:19,817
LAURA: We have armor too, of some of your fallen
people, will you reward us for that, thank you!

2986
03:19:19,817 --> 03:19:24,990
MARISHA: Yeah, you can buy it back for us or we
can go pawn it, your choice.

2987
03:19:24,990 --> 03:19:30,672
MATT: "That is property of the Crown, thank you
very much."

2988
03:19:30,672 --> 03:19:35,785
MARISHA: Well, unfortunately, it's property in her
bag right now, and it's real tough to get out of

2989
03:19:35,785 --> 03:19:37,025
that bag.

2990
03:19:37,025 --> 03:19:38,537
LAURA: Beau!

2991
03:19:38,537 --> 03:19:40,010
SAM: Don't tell them about the bag.

2992
03:19:40,010 --> 03:19:43,339
LAURA: Stop it, we're about to get our reward,
stop being a shithead right now.

2993
03:19:43,339 --> 03:19:44,811
MARISHA: Sorry, fair.

2994
03:19:44,811 --> 03:19:53,308
MATT: "If you would be as kind to remember these
fallen soldiers who protect you and the people of

2995
03:19:53,308 --> 03:20:00,675
"this city, by delivering unto us the armor and
weaponry that they had been lost with, I would be

2996
03:20:00,675 --> 03:20:03,921
"happy to go forward with delivering your reward."

2997
03:20:03,921 --> 03:20:08,205
TRAVIS: Who picked up all those items, anyway?

2998
03:20:08,205 --> 03:20:11,006
LAURA: I have them. Here's two sets of armor.

2999
03:20:11,006 --> 03:20:13,124
MATT: Two of the guards collect them.

3000
03:20:13,124 --> 03:20:14,830
LAURA: And two extra helmets.

3001
03:20:14,830 --> 03:20:20,773
LIAM: Side note: I did not come in this building.
I'm hanging back and giving Identify a whirl on

3002
03:20:20,773 --> 03:20:23,909
what's in my bag. That other armor. Outside.

3003
03:20:23,909 --> 03:20:29,547
SAM: Ooh.

3004
03:20:29,547 --> 03:20:32,609
TALIESIN: Travis will never see that card.

3005
03:20:32,609 --> 03:20:35,677
MATT: He comes back. They bring a small chest.

3006
03:20:35,677 --> 03:20:37,472
SAM: The card that says "give to Travis."

3007
03:20:37,472 --> 03:20:46,052
MATT: "700 gold pieces. Hand me the writ, please.
Thank you very much, and I appreciate that," and

3008
03:20:46,052 --> 03:20:53,109
he sets it out and hands it to you. "So. You seem
able-bodied. You've pulled through on something

3009
03:20:53,109 --> 03:21:00,787
"where few have been able to. If you're looking for
more work, I'm sure we'll have things. Bit light

3010
03:21:00,787 --> 03:21:03,495
"at the moment, but where can we find you, if we're
looking for you?"

3011
03:21:03,495 --> 03:21:06,475
TRAVIS: We're staying over at the--

3012
03:21:06,475 --> 03:21:08,276
LAURA: Leaky Tap.

3013
03:21:08,276 --> 03:21:13,515
TRAVIS: Although some of us were taking up at a
room at the--

3014
03:21:13,515 --> 03:21:15,155
LAURA: At the Pillow Trove, yes.

3015
03:21:15,155 --> 03:21:24,373
MATT: (laughing) "Of course you do. Leaky Tap,
good to know. All right, now shove off."

3016
03:21:24,373 --> 03:21:28,219
LAURA: What does that mean, "of course you do?"

3017
03:21:28,219 --> 03:21:30,740
MATT: Well, of course you do.

3018
03:21:30,740 --> 03:21:34,474
ASHLEY: She has a room there.

3019
03:21:34,474 --> 03:21:36,172
MATT: Of course she does.

3020
03:21:36,172 --> 03:21:39,414
LAURA: I do have a room there! I pull out my key.
I have a room.

3021
03:21:39,414 --> 03:21:44,128
MATT: Ah. Fair play. Now, shove off.

3022
03:21:44,128 --> 03:21:47,625
LAURA: I don't know why it mattered.

3023
03:21:47,625 --> 03:21:50,337
(laughter)

3024
03:21:50,337 --> 03:21:53,588
TRAVIS: 700 gold.

3025
03:21:53,588 --> 03:21:59,199
MATT: As the Herald turns and Voloshin's there,
the guards gather the armor and the weapons and stuff.

3026
03:21:59,199 --> 03:22:01,546
LAURA: Just the armor. I didn't give back the
swords.

3027
03:22:01,546 --> 03:22:03,481
MATT: Okay. Good to know.

3028
03:22:03,481 --> 03:22:04,826
MARISHA: Nice.

3029
03:22:04,826 --> 03:22:06,936
ASHLEY: Stick it to the man.

3030
03:22:06,936 --> 03:22:07,960
MARISHA: Hell yeah!

3031
03:22:07,960 --> 03:22:14,979
MATT: A voice comes through the hall and goes,
"Wait. I'd like to meet them." Voloshin stops and

3032
03:22:14,979 --> 03:22:23,366
goes, "Of course, Lawmaster." He steps back and,
from around the side of the hall, from one of the

3033
03:22:23,366 --> 03:22:31,448
doors on the left side of the building, a human
woman comes through, in her early 60s. Once-brown

3034
03:22:31,448 --> 03:22:39,238
hair has turned mostly gray and shoulder-length,
it's curled up a bit into a soft bob on the sides.

3035
03:22:39,238 --> 03:22:49,411
She's older, her face is weathered and has seen
some time. She's wearing robes of gold and white,

3036
03:22:49,411 --> 03:22:55,004
but they seem to be not ceremonial, or at least worn 
enough to the point where they look like they're worn for

3037
03:22:55,004 --> 03:23:07,092
comfort. She steps forward, and she has these warm
brown eyes that peek through this face. "Sorry to

3038
03:23:07,158 --> 03:23:13,346
"bother all of you. Word just came to me that you
were successful in taking care of this beast in

3039
03:23:13,346 --> 03:23:21,008
"the sewers. I am Lawmaster Orentha and I just
wanted to extend my thanks. It's not often that

3040
03:23:21,008 --> 03:23:31,519
"folks are willing to go to lengths and put their
lives on the line for the honor of those fallen of

3041
03:23:31,519 --> 03:23:36,825
"the Crownsguard, and those within the Hall of the
King, so I just wanted to say I appreciate that."

3042
03:23:36,825 --> 03:23:42,507
TRAVIS: Of course. We appreciate the law in this
town, and the services you provide. You can lean

3043
03:23:42,507 --> 03:23:45,368
on us for any further needs you might have.

3044
03:23:45,368 --> 03:23:54,963
MATT: "The Crown appreciates it, the people of the
city appreciate it, and I appreciate it. Thank

3045
03:23:54,963 --> 03:24:00,736
"you." She turns around and shuffles back into the
hallway. Everyone goes about their business again

3046
03:24:00,736 --> 03:24:03,107
and begins shoving you off towards the door.

3047
03:24:03,107 --> 03:24:04,642
LAURA: She seemed really nice.

3048
03:24:04,642 --> 03:24:05,657
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3049
03:24:05,657 --> 03:24:08,467
SAM: Why did all those people want to rebel
against her?

3050
03:24:08,467 --> 03:24:12,259
MARISHA: She's still a part of the crownsguard.
She's still a part of the system.

3051
03:24:12,259 --> 03:24:14,871
SAM: She seems nice, though.

3052
03:24:14,871 --> 03:24:20,125
MARISHA: Yeah, they're nice individually
sometimes, but they're still a part of a shitty

3053
03:24:20,125 --> 03:24:23,008
whole. A real shithole.

3054
03:24:23,008 --> 03:24:27,063
LAURA and TRAVIS: "A shitty hole."

3055
03:24:27,063 --> 03:24:35,314
SAM: There's not a lot of shades of gray in your
world, are there? It's just shit, or not shit.

3056
03:24:35,314 --> 03:24:39,080
MARISHA: It's been a long day.

3057
03:24:39,080 --> 03:24:42,318
TRAVIS: (laughs) "A shitty hole."

3058
03:24:42,318 --> 03:24:47,415
MATT: What's the casting time on Identify again?

3059
03:24:47,415 --> 03:24:53,785
LIAM: As a ritual, it's 11 minutes.

3060
03:24:53,785 --> 03:24:59,825
MATT: You guys would be exiting the building just
as you've finished that process. You complete it,

3061
03:24:59,825 --> 03:25:03,698
take a moment to think it over, and you hear them
all exiting and talking to themselves, as they're

3062
03:25:03,698 --> 03:25:07,684
ribbing Beau on the way out. You quickly gather
your things.

3063
03:25:07,684 --> 03:25:10,689
MARISHA: Look, I don't mean to have resting bitch
face, okay?

3064
03:25:10,689 --> 03:25:12,702
TRAVIS: Yeah, but it hasn't changed at all.

3065
03:25:12,702 --> 03:25:14,063
MARISHA: I'm working on it.

3066
03:25:14,063 --> 03:25:17,130
TRAVIS: If anything, later in the day it gets
worse. I'm just letting you know.

3067
03:25:17,130 --> 03:25:19,116
LIAM: It's not so much restive as active.

3068
03:25:19,116 --> 03:25:20,671
TALIESIN: Yes, it's like working bitch face.

3069
03:25:20,671 --> 03:25:22,163
MARISHA: That's cool.

3070
03:25:22,163 --> 03:25:24,344
LIAM: The bag's closed. You don't see shit.

3071
03:25:24,344 --> 03:25:26,978
MARISHA: You're real quick.

3072
03:25:26,978 --> 03:25:34,850
LIAM: I heard you coming. You're loud. You're a
lot. And that's Liam to Marisha.

3073
03:25:34,850 --> 03:25:38,247
MARISHA: Oh honey, I know.

3074
03:25:38,247 --> 03:25:41,330
(laughter)

3075
03:25:41,330 --> 03:25:42,930
SAM: Are we each taking 100 gold?

3076
03:25:42,930 --> 03:25:46,138
LAURA: Yes, 100 gold. I was going to wait
until we got somewhere private to do it, but sure.

3077
03:25:46,187 --> 03:25:48,409
Everyone take 100 gold.

3078
03:25:48,409 --> 03:25:56,343
TALIESIN: Look at that. That's brilliant.

3079
03:25:56,414 --> 03:26:03,331
SAM: We did it, and we never have to do another
adventure again. Right?

3080
03:26:03,331 --> 03:26:06,130
TALIESIN: I don't know about you, I've got goals.

3081
03:26:06,130 --> 03:26:08,581
LIAM: Campaign three, next week.

3082
03:26:08,581 --> 03:26:10,753
MATT: Yup. That was it, thank you for watching.

3083
03:26:10,753 --> 03:26:15,461
TALIESIN: I'm working towards something.

3084
03:26:15,461 --> 03:26:17,429
SAM: Towards something? What?

3085
03:26:17,429 --> 03:26:19,535
TALIESIN: Something.

3086
03:26:19,535 --> 03:26:20,922
SAM: What?!

3087
03:26:20,922 --> 03:26:23,641
TALIESIN: Buy me a drink and I'll tell you.

3088
03:26:23,641 --> 03:26:24,636
SAM: All right.

3089
03:26:24,636 --> 03:26:25,589
LIAM: What's the plan now?

3090
03:26:25,589 --> 03:26:26,727
LAURA: We all smell like poop!

3091
03:26:26,727 --> 03:26:27,616
LIAM: To go to this place?

3092
03:26:27,616 --> 03:26:28,858
ASHLEY: Bathhouse?

3093
03:26:28,858 --> 03:26:33,660
LIAM: No, we are going to The Pillow House, ja?
The Pillow Trove? The Pillow Place?

3094
03:26:33,660 --> 03:26:38,658
LAURA: Yeah, but we should probably get cleaned
up, because they're just going to stop us the minute we

3095
03:26:38,658 --> 03:26:46,943
get inside. Should we go and see Pumat Sol, and
see if he'll make us clean?

3096
03:26:46,943 --> 03:26:50,914
TRAVIS: We do have some extra coin. Maybe he's got
some fancier shit to buy.

3097
03:26:50,914 --> 03:26:56,429
LIAM: Also, as long as we're in here-- I couldn't
get in earlier, but we're here now-- there is a

3098
03:26:56,429 --> 03:26:58,051
stop. I wanted you to go with me.

3099
03:26:58,051 --> 03:26:59,988
LAURA: We're not in the Tri-Spires anymore.

3100
03:26:59,988 --> 03:27:01,130
LIAM: Where are we now?

3101
03:27:01,130 --> 03:27:03,371
MATT: You guys are back at the King's Hall, back
in the Interstead Sprawl.

3102
03:27:03,371 --> 03:27:04,709
LIAM: That's a bummer.

3103
03:27:04,709 --> 03:27:06,940
MARISHA: We got to shower.

3104
03:27:07,010 --> 03:27:09,719
TRAVIS: For someone who knows the exact time
of night, you are shit with directions.

3105
03:27:09,798 --> 03:27:11,837
LIAM: That's up to him, not me.

3106
03:27:11,965 --> 03:27:14,310
MATT: I thought I was pretty clear. Everyone else
got it.

3107
03:27:14,310 --> 03:27:16,238
LIAM: Liam is very different than Caleb.

3108
03:27:16,238 --> 03:27:16,989
MATT: That's okay.

3109
03:27:16,989 --> 03:27:20,670
MARISHA: You know memory is different than
being able to tell the time of day by the sun, right?

3110
03:27:20,670 --> 03:27:30,591
LIAM: Hm? No, I remember everything that happens
in the last month. I don't, Caleb does. I have a

3111
03:27:30,591 --> 03:27:31,799
Clippy. I have a magic Clippy.

3112
03:27:31,799 --> 03:27:34,859
MARISHA: Yeah, that's fine, but time of day.

3113
03:27:34,859 --> 03:27:39,599
LIAM: Time of day, I know. That's part of the
feat. I know the hour of the day.

3114
03:27:39,599 --> 03:27:45,556
MARISHA: That's bananas. You should be able to
look at the sun and say, "oh, six."

3115
03:27:45,556 --> 03:27:48,249
LIAM: I am so cheating by following the rules in
the book.

3116
03:27:48,249 --> 03:27:52,881
MATT: I know. Right now it's close to 8:30, 9:00.
It's still early evening-ish.

3117
03:27:52,881 --> 03:27:58,639
TALIESIN: Dinner, and bad decisions, and
cleanliness would be great.

3118
03:27:58,639 --> 03:28:01,099
LAURA: We have to get not stinky before we eat,
okay?

3119
03:28:01,099 --> 03:28:05,413
TRAVIS: Agreed. Should we head back, clean up?

3120
03:28:05,413 --> 03:28:07,735
SAM: Sounds good.

3121
03:28:07,735 --> 03:28:13,182
MATT: You guys, easy enough, find your way back to
The Leaky Tap, where you can utilize the washroom

3122
03:28:13,182 --> 03:28:16,239
to get yourselves back to a personable state.

3123
03:28:16,239 --> 03:28:18,646
LIAM: On the stroll: Fjord?

3124
03:28:18,646 --> 03:28:19,954
TRAVIS: Yeah?

3125
03:28:19,954 --> 03:28:23,496
LIAM: I want to talk to you about how that went
back there. Can we walk alone for a minute?

3126
03:28:23,496 --> 03:28:25,902
TRAVIS: Sure, if you'd like.

3127
03:28:25,902 --> 03:28:35,428
LIAM: Let's drag back. Two things. One is, I
didn't bring it up, even though maybe Beauregard

3128
03:28:35,428 --> 03:28:42,021
knows, but I found something in there that I think
is up your alley. I found some armor, beyond just

3129
03:28:42,021 --> 03:28:49,770
crownsguard armor, down there. I mean, listen, my
friend. You spit out salt water. You've got a

3130
03:28:49,770 --> 03:28:53,019
sword that's covered in fucking anemones and
shit.

3131
03:28:53,019 --> 03:28:56,996
TRAVIS: I'm not repeating that word.

3132
03:28:56,996 --> 03:29:06,809
LIAM: This armor is like the Little Mermaid armor.
It's all for you. I found it, but I would like to

3133
03:29:06,809 --> 03:29:12,965
trade it for you. Yeah, you have that glove, and I
know I handed it over willingly just yesterday,

3134
03:29:12,965 --> 03:29:23,660
but I have a checkered past and an interesting
history with flame. Fire. There's no real reason.

3135
03:29:23,660 --> 03:29:31,297
You'd be very good with that glove, but I feel
like I would like to have that glove, and I would

3136
03:29:31,297 --> 03:29:35,195
love for you to have this armor. I took a look at
it while you guys were inside, and it would allow

3137
03:29:35,195 --> 03:29:42,521
you to move freely in the ocean or in rivers or
lakes, underwater, and keep you safe in water.

3138
03:29:42,521 --> 03:29:55,780
TRAVIS: Wow. Wish I had that before. Yeah, I think
a trade would be fine, but I'll trade you for a

3139
03:29:55,780 --> 03:30:05,473
story of why your past is so checkered with flame.
You seem to trust in me enough to tell me about it.

3140
03:30:05,473 --> 03:30:14,216
LIAM: I don't trust you yet. I don't trust any of
these people yet, except for-- No, I don't trust

3141
03:30:14,216 --> 03:30:16,003
any of these people yet.

3142
03:30:16,003 --> 03:30:17,376
TRAVIS: That's too bad.

3143
03:30:21,586 --> 03:30:46,752
LIAM: Ja. I've made mistakes in my life. I've
harmed people. Not in a long time. You know, I

3144
03:30:46,830 --> 03:31:01,836
thought I was going to be something, someday, a
long time ago, and now I don't. Oh, god. Ask me

3145
03:31:01,836 --> 03:31:06,587
again in a couple of days. I will prepare an
answer that is better than this for you, I promise.

3146
03:31:06,587 --> 03:31:13,258
TRAVIS: Sure. You know, we've all harmed people,
but I hope that you will learn to trust me, in

3147
03:31:13,258 --> 03:31:21,263
time, and I appreciate you sharing that. Here, I'm
fairly certain that you will do far more damage

3148
03:31:21,263 --> 03:31:25,180
with this than my shitty attempt did.

3149
03:31:26,624 --> 03:31:27,784
LIAM: Thank you.

3150
03:31:27,784 --> 03:31:32,392
TRAVIS: Of course. Thanks for the armor. What does
it look like?

3151
03:31:32,392 --> 03:31:35,292
(laughter)

3152
03:31:36,042 --> 03:31:42,529
MATT: It's a darker gray, but elements of where
it's been pressed in with leather scrolling,

3153
03:31:42,960 --> 03:31:47,634
designed to look almost like waves curling on the
outer parts of the different leather plates, have

3154
03:31:47,634 --> 03:31:59,012
a very faint turquoise inlay color on the inside
that you can only see when it's directly lit. It

3155
03:31:59,012 --> 03:32:03,771
looks like a very beautiful set of leather armor.
There's no arms to it, other than the bracer

3156
03:32:03,771 --> 03:32:09,467
plates right there, there's no sleeve. There you
go. It's got an arm guard and a bracer there,

3157
03:32:09,467 --> 03:32:16,408
shoulder piece, the torso portion, a couple of
plates that go over that, and some leg guards.

3158
03:32:16,408 --> 03:32:20,650
TRAVIS: All good things. Thank you for this.

3159
03:32:20,650 --> 03:32:24,761
LIAM: Thank you. No, you've go to go higher.

3160
03:32:24,761 --> 03:32:28,578
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're welcome.

3161
03:32:30,148 --> 03:32:32,462
MARISHA: Don't want to interrupt your "broment."

3162
03:32:32,606 --> 03:32:42,974
LIAM: Oh, hi. You want to be part of the bro
moment? Or a Beau moment?

3163
03:32:42,974 --> 03:32:46,589
MARISHA: I'm not here. I am not here.

3164
03:32:46,589 --> 03:32:48,255
LIAM: I thought you were, I thought you'd walked
up.

3165
03:32:48,255 --> 03:32:50,863
LAURA: Are we going to bed, or are we what?

3166
03:32:50,863 --> 03:32:52,787
MATT: What are you guys doing?

3167
03:32:52,787 --> 03:32:56,519
TRAVIS: We're going to get clean first, because
good god, we're going to clear out that fucking

3168
03:32:56,519 --> 03:32:57,501
tavern.

3169
03:32:57,501 --> 03:33:00,477
MATT: We'll say you got clean for the expediency
of the story. We don't have to roleplay through

3170
03:33:00,477 --> 03:33:02,161
your bathing individually.

3171
03:33:02,161 --> 03:33:03,470
TRAVIS: But Matt--

3172
03:33:03,470 --> 03:33:07,743
MATT: Unless you really want to. Always stop me if
you want to have a moment.

3173
03:33:07,743 --> 03:33:09,852
LIAM: We went to the bathhouse to get clean?

3174
03:33:09,852 --> 03:33:11,668
MATT: No, you went back to The Leaky Tap.

3175
03:33:12,918 --> 03:33:17,764
LIAM: By the way, part of the reason I didn't wash
up at The Leaky Tap is because, in medieval times,

3176
03:33:17,856 --> 03:33:22,246
they didn't have baths. I thought, this isn't the
Sheraton, they don't have a bath.

3177
03:33:22,246 --> 03:33:24,206
LAURA: We're pretending that there's a bath.

3178
03:33:24,206 --> 03:33:27,645
MATT: This isn't medieval times. In the fantasy
world, it's a weird mixture of different time

3179
03:33:27,645 --> 03:33:32,636
periods, and when I say they have a washroom, I
mean it's a basin with water that is replaced

3180
03:33:32,636 --> 03:33:37,929
every couple hours that people communally come up
and wash in. It's not the cleanest water, and it's

3181
03:33:37,929 --> 03:33:41,776
probably been used by other people as well, and if
you bathe fully in it, it might be changed before

3182
03:33:41,776 --> 03:33:44,196
the next two or three people use it.

3183
03:33:44,196 --> 03:33:50,177
LIAM: I was under the assumption that you had to
be de Rolo level to have a bath in your house.

3184
03:33:50,177 --> 03:33:55,246
MATT: In your house. They have one washroom for
the multitude of rooms the entire tavern has, and

3185
03:33:55,246 --> 03:34:00,156
the water is changed every few hours, maybe.
That's what I'm saying. But it's functional.

3186
03:34:00,156 --> 03:34:02,981
LAURA: That's why we should have gone to Pumat
Sol's.

3187
03:34:02,981 --> 03:34:05,832
TALIESIN: That's why people have bathhouses, to
clean up.

3188
03:34:05,832 --> 03:34:10,565
SAM: When Fjord's taking a bath, I'm going to go
through his stuff and try to find his letter.

3189
03:34:10,565 --> 03:34:12,268
LAURA: His letter?

3190
03:34:12,268 --> 03:34:14,807
SAM: The letter for the Solstryce Academy.

3191
03:34:14,807 --> 03:34:17,716
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a stealth check.

3192
03:34:18,966 --> 03:34:21,573
SAM: Not good. 15.

3193
03:34:21,573 --> 03:34:22,492
MATT: 15?

3194
03:34:26,264 --> 03:34:28,592
Would you have taken your stuff in with
you?

3195
03:34:28,592 --> 03:34:30,623
TALIESIN: Or would I still be in the room?

3196
03:34:30,623 --> 03:34:34,005
MATT: Molly would probably still be in the room.

3197
03:34:34,005 --> 03:34:37,757
SAM: I got to stealth past Molly, or get him out
of the room.

3198
03:34:37,757 --> 03:34:39,854
MATT: You do. Make a perception check, Molly.

3199
03:34:40,335 --> 03:34:42,705
TRAVIS: I'm certainly not trying to hide it.

3200
03:34:44,225 --> 03:34:47,148
TALIESIN: Let's call that a 20.

3201
03:34:47,730 --> 03:34:52,436
MATT: You watch as Nott slowly creeps into the
room, heading over towards Fjord's pack.

3202
03:34:52,436 --> 03:34:54,596
SAM: Ooh.

3203
03:34:57,544 --> 03:34:59,282
TALIESIN: Whatcha doing?

3204
03:34:59,305 --> 03:35:00,873
SAM: (yells)

3205
03:35:00,873 --> 03:35:06,893
There's no liquor in here, oh boy, I better
go down to the bar.

3206
03:35:06,893 --> 03:35:08,969
TALIESIN: What were you looking for?

3207
03:35:08,969 --> 03:35:11,352
SAM: Nothing. Liquor.

3208
03:35:11,352 --> 03:35:14,632
TALIESIN: Were you looking for this? I hold up a
folded piece of paper.

3209
03:35:14,632 --> 03:35:16,283
SAM: (gasps)

3210
03:35:16,283 --> 03:35:18,889
TALIESIN: What will you give me for it?

3211
03:35:19,868 --> 03:35:22,975
SAM: I'll give you a whole gold piece.

3212
03:35:23,100 --> 03:35:26,630
TALIESIN: No, something-- I don't want money, I
want something, give me something.

3213
03:35:26,877 --> 03:35:28,414
SAM: Two gold pieces!

3214
03:35:28,414 --> 03:35:30,843
TALIESIN: Not gold pieces. What do you have?

3215
03:35:30,843 --> 03:35:32,240
SAM: Let me look--

3216
03:35:32,240 --> 03:35:34,633
(laughter)

3217
03:35:36,538 --> 03:35:40,043
SAM: I have a vial of acid.

3218
03:35:40,043 --> 03:35:41,872
TALIESIN: That'll do.

3219
03:35:45,102 --> 03:35:45,914
(laughter)

3220
03:35:45,914 --> 03:35:46,988
SAM: What is this?

3221
03:35:46,988 --> 03:35:48,372
TALIESIN: It's a blank piece of paper.

3222
03:35:48,372 --> 03:35:49,556
SAM: Ah, fuck you!

3223
03:35:49,556 --> 03:35:53,623
(laughter)

3224
03:35:53,703 --> 03:35:55,713
SAM: Maybe it's invisible ink.

3225
03:35:55,713 --> 03:36:00,764
TALIESIN: I hand back the acid. Don't try and go
through his stuff, you're just going to get caught.

3226
03:36:00,844 --> 03:36:02,386
SAM: All right.

3227
03:36:02,386 --> 03:36:04,505
TALIESIN: What did we talk about grumpy people?

3228
03:36:04,505 --> 03:36:10,632
SAM: You're right, he's not very grumpy. He should
be. If I barfed up salt water every morning I

3229
03:36:10,632 --> 03:36:11,976
would be grumpy.

3230
03:36:11,976 --> 03:36:14,800
TALIESIN: Maybe if he spends more time around Beau
he'll get grumpier.

3231
03:36:14,800 --> 03:36:22,189
SAM: You know what, I think he is grumpy, but he
stands next to Beau so much that he looks happy.

3232
03:36:22,257 --> 03:36:26,351
(laughter)

3233
03:36:26,351 --> 03:36:29,037
TRAVIS: Grumpy-ass wingman makes me look better in
comparison.

3234
03:36:29,037 --> 03:36:30,177
MATT: I mean.

3235
03:36:30,177 --> 03:36:36,136
TALIESIN: That's a fair point. I stand up. Don't
go through my things, I know everything I have.

3236
03:36:36,136 --> 03:36:42,805
And I walk out the door. And I walk by him. She's
going through your stuff, by the way.

3237
03:36:42,805 --> 03:36:44,456
TRAVIS: Who? Which one?

3238
03:36:44,456 --> 03:36:46,277
TALIESIN: I've already walked away.

3239
03:36:46,277 --> 03:36:49,645
TRAVIS: I shuffle in with like a towel. Nott! What
the fuck!

3240
03:36:49,645 --> 03:36:51,586
(laughter)

3241
03:36:51,586 --> 03:36:52,501
TRAVIS: Get out!

3242
03:36:52,501 --> 03:36:53,308
SAM: I'm sorry!

3243
03:36:53,308 --> 03:36:55,463
TRAVIS: Shoo! Shoo!

3244
03:36:55,463 --> 03:36:59,370
(laughter)

3245
03:36:59,370 --> 03:37:00,671
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch!

3246
03:37:00,671 --> 03:37:02,712
TALIESIN: I am downstairs having a drink.

3247
03:37:02,712 --> 03:37:05,509
(laughter)

3248
03:37:05,509 --> 03:37:18,581
MATT: All right. You finish your baths, you all
convene down in the tavern. Yeah. When you guys

3249
03:37:18,581 --> 03:37:28,039
come down there and begin to reconvene, about two
tables away you see, sitting alone with a tankard,

3250
03:37:28,039 --> 03:37:33,442
a familiar dwarven figure to both Beau and Fjord.

3251
03:37:33,442 --> 03:37:36,703
MARISHA: Oh, wait.

3252
03:37:38,760 --> 03:37:40,723
MATT: Ulog, who you had met before.

3253
03:37:40,723 --> 03:37:42,155
SAM: Ulog?

3254
03:37:42,155 --> 03:37:45,578
MATT: Ulog, with a "G".

3255
03:37:45,578 --> 03:37:46,878
MARISHA: Oh, Ulog! Not "lok"?

3256
03:37:46,878 --> 03:37:49,843
SAM: The dwarf, from the Knights of Requital.

3257
03:37:49,843 --> 03:37:51,965
TRAVIS: Oh, with the buzzed head.

3258
03:37:52,080 --> 03:37:59,415
MATT: Yeah, you watch as you guys approach and as
soon as you all gather at the table, he gets up

3259
03:37:59,415 --> 03:38:01,664
and walks over.

3260
03:38:01,664 --> 03:38:07,593
MARISHA: He was the one who was super not-cool
with us being there, super angry.

3261
03:38:07,593 --> 03:38:09,211
MATT: He seemed to be, yeah.

3262
03:38:09,211 --> 03:38:11,532
MARISHA: Wife Illiana, into it!

3263
03:38:11,532 --> 03:38:20,050
MATT: He walks behind where Fjord and Beau are and
goes, "Don't mean to bother you, but if I could

3264
03:38:20,050 --> 03:38:22,745
have a moment of your time, I'd like to talk."

3265
03:38:22,745 --> 03:38:23,874
TRAVIS: Of course.

3266
03:38:23,874 --> 03:38:25,113
MARISHA: Yeah, man.

3267
03:38:25,113 --> 03:38:29,713
MATT: "Excuse us." He leads you guys back to where
the cellar is.

3268
03:38:29,713 --> 03:38:31,649
TRAVIS: (quietly) Don't talk.

3269
03:38:32,779 --> 03:38:40,423
MATT: You guys head back, he nods over towards
your dragonborn bartender, gives him a nod, walks

3270
03:38:40,423 --> 03:38:45,599
past, leads you down to the same cellar, it's dark
in there. There's no light, but he lights a hooded

3271
03:38:45,599 --> 03:38:50,232
lantern as you enter and it gives this low,
mysterious atmosphere in the shadows as he spins

3272
03:38:50,232 --> 03:38:52,644
around and goes,

3273
03:38:59,004 --> 03:39:10,405
"I've been watching you a bit. You're a curious
lot. More of you than came to the meeting. Five

3274
03:39:10,453 --> 03:39:19,524
more. Did you-- and please, be honest, I'm good at
telling otherwise-- did you reveal any of our

3275
03:39:19,524 --> 03:39:25,097
sentiments to your-- of our moot to your
companions?"

3276
03:39:25,097 --> 03:39:28,150
MARISHA: No we did not.

3277
03:39:28,150 --> 03:39:35,589
MATT: "Went and saw you come back to town with
this spider-beast you had on your shoulders, now

3278
03:39:35,589 --> 03:39:46,530
that's-- take it you're pretty good with a sword,
maybe? With a bow? Experienced? What's your skill

3279
03:39:46,530 --> 03:39:50,743
sets, if I might ask, beyond just being curious?"

3280
03:39:51,534 --> 03:39:57,828
TRAVIS: Well, we come from all sorts of different
backgrounds. I happen to be very handy at sea,

3281
03:39:57,828 --> 03:40:03,382
know my way around a merchant area. Beau?

3282
03:40:05,045 --> 03:40:10,988
MARISHA: I consider being curious a pretty high
skill set, but since you're asking beyond that.

3283
03:40:10,988 --> 03:40:17,370
I'm pretty good with this here bo. Pretty good
fighter. Named Beau. It's a little redundant, to

3284
03:40:17,370 --> 03:40:18,740
be totally honest.

3285
03:40:18,740 --> 03:40:20,368
MATT: "That's a little strange, not going to lie."

3286
03:40:20,368 --> 03:40:21,243
MARISHA: It's kind of obnoxious.

3287
03:40:21,243 --> 03:40:22,010
MATT: "Yeah."

3288
03:40:22,010 --> 03:40:23,241
MARISHA: Sometimes it irritates me.

3289
03:40:23,241 --> 03:40:24,090
MATT: "Understood."

3290
03:40:24,090 --> 03:40:25,524
MARISHA: Yeah.

3291
03:40:25,524 --> 03:40:27,773
MATT: "Curse upon ye who made that decision for
you."

3292
03:40:27,773 --> 03:40:29,111
MARISHA: Can't pick them.

3293
03:40:29,111 --> 03:40:32,692
(laughter)

3294
03:40:33,041 --> 03:40:35,611
MATT: "So you can move quickly, without a ruckus,
you say?"

3295
03:40:35,611 --> 03:40:38,350
TRAVIS: At times, we can be quite quiet.

3296
03:40:38,350 --> 03:40:44,417
MATT: "And your friends, do they share our
sentiments?"

3297
03:40:44,417 --> 03:40:51,502
TRAVIS: I would say it's safe to say that they
don't have sentiments opposed to yours.

3298
03:40:51,502 --> 03:40:55,321
MARISHA: Indifference is a pretty strong
sentiment.

3299
03:40:55,994 --> 03:41:03,550
MATT: (sighing) "Listen. If you indeed have a
heart for goodness in this world, and you want to

3300
03:41:03,550 --> 03:41:10,401
make a difference, we're moving on to something
soon that I think we could use your aid on. You

3301
03:41:10,401 --> 03:41:19,810
and your companions. Blast, if you need payments,
I've got coin I can muster, and I see you do work

3302
03:41:19,810 --> 03:41:30,023
for coin. I have few others of us who can chip in
as well. Other than myself, most of the Knights of

3303
03:41:30,023 --> 03:41:40,916
Zadash are unskilled in the ways of the arm. We're
willing to raise a voice, but not much of a fist,

3304
03:41:40,916 --> 03:41:50,635
or backing up a word with strength. I'm willing to
make it worth your time."

3305
03:41:54,755 --> 03:42:04,929
"You don't have to answer now. Tomorrow at
midnight, me and a few others from the group, the

3306
03:42:05,020 --> 03:42:11,417
decision makers, we're meeting back down here. If
you're in, bring your friends, we can all talk.

3307
03:42:11,417 --> 03:42:18,137
Give you more information about what's going on,
and you can say yes or no at your leisure. But I

3308
03:42:18,137 --> 03:42:24,779
think we have a chance to really do something good
in this city. To change part of the status quo. To

3309
03:42:24,779 --> 03:42:33,205
root out some of the unworthy at the top. Think on
it."

3310
03:42:34,206 --> 03:42:39,829
TRAVIS: Just letting you know that coin always
helps, but we did see the posting outside the

3311
03:42:39,829 --> 03:42:48,754
King's Hall about uprisings against the Empire. It
seems the heat on your group might be quite intense.

3312
03:42:49,515 --> 03:42:56,392
MATT: "We're not against the Empire. It protects
us. There are good things about it. What we're

3313
03:42:56,392 --> 03:43:05,523
against are the people that abuse the system.
There are a handful in this town and their time is up."

3314
03:43:05,523 --> 03:43:12,092
TRAVIS: What cancers are you looking to remove? I
would tell you that tomorrow night, the devil lies

3315
03:43:12,092 --> 03:43:14,614
in the details, and that will depend.

3316
03:43:15,074 --> 03:43:21,533
MATT: "Your curiosity is piqued. Come by. We'll
talk."

3317
03:43:21,533 --> 03:43:26,799
MARISHA: What makes you think that now is the
right time for all of this?

3318
03:43:26,799 --> 03:43:38,003
MATT: "Well, we've been talking for a very long
time, and there is a shift coming that we want to

3319
03:43:38,003 --> 03:43:50,597
ride the wave of. I'll let Dolan tell you the
details tomorrow. Anyway." He snuffs the lantern.

3320
03:43:50,597 --> 03:43:52,428
"Good night."

3321
03:43:52,428 --> 03:43:54,986
TRAVIS: Good night.

3322
03:43:55,281 --> 03:43:57,560
MARISHA: (shouting) Oh god, stubbed my toe!

3323
03:43:57,560 --> 03:44:01,547
TRAVIS: Wow. That was really good. Like, you
didn't act like a total shitfuck.

3324
03:44:01,547 --> 03:44:05,591
MARISHA: Thanks. I was trying to not show my
emotions on my face.

3325
03:44:05,591 --> 03:44:08,712
TRAVIS: Whatever it was, yeah, lock it in. That
was great. Really nice.

3326
03:44:08,712 --> 03:44:11,340
MARISHA: Yeah, thank you. I'm trying to get better
at it. Yeah.

3327
03:44:11,340 --> 03:44:12,520
TRAVIS: That was promising.

3328
03:44:12,520 --> 03:44:13,666
MARISHA: What do you think?

3329
03:44:13,666 --> 03:44:17,654
TRAVIS: About that? I mean, shit, I can't really
speak to it. I have to figure out what they want

3330
03:44:17,654 --> 03:44:18,924
to do tomorrow.

3331
03:44:18,924 --> 03:44:23,506
MARISHA: In my experience, it doesn't matter if he
thinks he's fucking with the Empire or not. The

3332
03:44:23,506 --> 03:44:26,936
Empire is going to look at it as fucking with
them, and that never ends well.

3333
03:44:26,936 --> 03:44:29,945
TRAVIS: That's right. If it's amateur hour, we're
going to be shooting ourselves in the foot.

3334
03:44:29,945 --> 03:44:32,941
MARISHA: Last thing we want to do is take the fall
for these assholes.

3335
03:44:32,941 --> 03:44:35,313
TRAVIS: No joke. Especially since we just got
here.

3336
03:44:35,313 --> 03:44:39,781
MARISHA: And he's talking like he wants us to be
the fist to his voice. What the fuck is that?

3337
03:44:39,781 --> 03:44:41,672
TRAVIS: Yeah, what the fuck?

3338
03:44:41,672 --> 03:44:43,495
MARISHA and TRAVIS: (sigh)

3339
03:44:44,435 --> 03:44:45,291
TRAVIS: Beer?

3340
03:44:45,400 --> 03:44:46,543
MARISHA: Yeah. Yeah.

3341
03:44:46,543 --> 03:44:47,747
TRAVIS: Okay.

3342
03:44:49,578 --> 03:44:53,135
MATT: All right. You guys reconvene with the rest
of the group.

3343
03:44:53,696 --> 03:44:58,183
LAURA: So. I walked in and the guy was like-- you
know, he had his arms above his head, he was

3344
03:44:58,183 --> 03:45:04,449
chained to the bed, right? He didn't know where he
left the key! I know I don't even know how long

3345
03:45:04,449 --> 03:45:05,448
he'd been there.

3346
03:45:05,448 --> 03:45:09,119
TALIESIN: Well he forgot that he put it there! You
think you'd still feel that.

3347
03:45:09,119 --> 03:45:10,850
SAM: He paid for that service?

3348
03:45:10,850 --> 03:45:12,492
LAURA: Oh, people will pay for all sorts of weird
things.

3349
03:45:12,492 --> 03:45:13,954
SAM: Wow.

3350
03:45:13,954 --> 03:45:15,158
LAURA: Oh, hi guys!

3351
03:45:15,158 --> 03:45:16,220
TRAVIS: Hey.

3352
03:45:16,220 --> 03:45:18,073
MARISHA: 'Sup.

3353
03:45:18,312 --> 03:45:26,391
TRAVIS: I wasn't sure what our next engagement
might be, but it seems like we might not have to

3354
03:45:26,391 --> 03:45:27,890
wait that long.

3355
03:45:27,890 --> 03:45:30,265
SAM: Did we get another job offer?

3356
03:45:30,265 --> 03:45:38,196
TRAVIS: Well, not through the city per se, but
remember that group that we joined the other day?

3357
03:45:38,196 --> 03:45:40,445
LAURA: The cult? The orgy cult?

3358
03:45:40,445 --> 03:45:48,191
TRAVIS: No that is not at all, no, no. We joined
their meeting, right? We did not join them, we

3359
03:45:48,191 --> 03:45:49,932
didn't participate--

3360
03:45:49,932 --> 03:45:52,039
MARISHA: We sampled.

3361
03:45:52,039 --> 03:45:58,532
TRAVIS: We were in the presence of an attended
meeting of individuals.

3362
03:45:58,532 --> 03:46:02,091
LAURA: So they offered you money?

3363
03:46:02,091 --> 03:46:05,208
LIAM: More of a voyeuristic position that we're
talking about here.

3364
03:46:05,208 --> 03:46:07,641
LAURA: They offered you money to join in.

3365
03:46:09,066 --> 03:46:12,203
TRAVIS: Maybe it's just us, we just go,
fuck these other--

3366
03:46:12,203 --> 03:46:13,721
TALIESIN: No no no!

3367
03:46:13,721 --> 03:46:15,881
SAM: What do they want you to do?

3368
03:46:16,007 --> 03:46:19,290
LIAM: You kept your eyes wide shut, is what you're
saying.

3369
03:46:19,290 --> 03:46:22,682
SAM: Come on, what's the fidelio?

3370
03:46:22,682 --> 03:46:27,102
TALIESIN: Well done! Oh, that was terrible.

3371
03:46:27,102 --> 03:46:31,741
TRAVIS: Tomorrow evening there's going to be a
meeting of that same group and they would like to

3372
03:46:31,741 --> 03:46:33,565
hire our services.

3373
03:46:33,565 --> 03:46:37,466
LAURA: Don't you think it's stupid to say all of
this right here?

3374
03:46:37,466 --> 03:46:39,870
TRAVIS: Why? Am I speaking real loud?

3375
03:46:39,870 --> 03:46:42,230
MARISHA: Are we in the tavern?

3376
03:46:42,230 --> 03:46:45,960
MATT: You guys are in the tavern at the table, but
you're keeping your voices somewhat discreet.

3377
03:46:47,109 --> 03:46:48,483
MARISHA: Is anyone watching?

3378
03:46:48,483 --> 03:46:50,813
MATT: No one seems to be paying immediate
attention.

3379
03:46:50,813 --> 03:46:52,832
TRAVIS: Do you want me to write it down?

3380
03:46:52,832 --> 03:46:55,679
LAURA: Yes.

3381
03:46:55,679 --> 03:46:58,660
TRAVIS: Okay. I'll write it down for Jester, but
for everybody else--

3382
03:46:58,660 --> 03:47:01,698
(laughter)

3383
03:47:03,133 --> 03:47:06,248
TRAVIS: Tomorrow at midnight, we're going to see
what it is they want to do, and if the money's

3384
03:47:06,248 --> 03:47:09,973
right and if it's not stupid.

3385
03:47:09,973 --> 03:47:14,399
LIAM: "If the money's right and if it's not
stupid" is a good philosophy for this group.

3386
03:47:14,399 --> 03:47:17,969
LAURA: How can we be sure he's telling the truth?

3387
03:47:17,969 --> 03:47:20,460
MARISHA: He didn't tell us a lot of anything.

3388
03:47:20,460 --> 03:47:24,540
LAURA: But how do you know that he isn't setting
you up to be turned into the Crownsguard?

3389
03:47:24,540 --> 03:47:26,507
TALIESIN: Exactly what she said.

3390
03:47:26,507 --> 03:47:30,709
TRAVIS: Well, since it's in the same place, it's
in the same cellar, I figure you guys can keep

3391
03:47:30,709 --> 03:47:37,447
watch above while we're getting info down below.
We don't all need to be down in the same place.

3392
03:47:37,447 --> 03:47:41,094
LIAM: We can have my cat tomorrow to link the two
groups.

3393
03:47:41,094 --> 03:47:42,785
TRAVIS: Where's your cat?

3394
03:47:42,785 --> 03:47:45,417
LIAM: Oh boy, he got kicked to shit today.

3395
03:47:45,417 --> 03:47:47,983
MARISHA: Sorry, I didn't mean to--

3396
03:47:47,983 --> 03:47:50,114
LAURA: Like kicked to death?

3397
03:47:50,114 --> 03:47:54,008
LIAM: Well, you know, it's hazy because he's never
really kicked to death, he's just kicked off of

3398
03:47:54,008 --> 03:47:57,140
the material plane.

3399
03:47:57,140 --> 03:47:59,796
MARISHA: He got kicked into another dimension!

3400
03:47:59,796 --> 03:48:05,138
LIAM: I'm not going to lie, it does hurt when he's
gone, but I always know he can come back if I have

3401
03:48:05,138 --> 03:48:06,237
the coin.

3402
03:48:06,237 --> 03:48:08,051
TRAVIS: Was it one kick? Just one.

3403
03:48:11,781 --> 03:48:13,460
MARISHA: Oh, it's not funny.

3404
03:48:13,576 --> 03:48:18,675
LIAM: It's a little funny. Frumpkin has a good
sense of humor about it.

3405
03:48:18,675 --> 03:48:22,369
TRAVIS: You'd have to, you get kicked into a
fucking other dimension.

3406
03:48:22,369 --> 03:48:24,258
MARISHA: But who kicks a fucking cat?

3407
03:48:24,258 --> 03:48:28,887
LIAM: Exactly! Who kicks a fucking cat exactly is
my point! You can do a lot of things and have a

3408
03:48:28,887 --> 03:48:31,808
very bad day but who kicks a cat?!

3409
03:48:31,808 --> 03:48:34,125
TRAVIS: Did you get a name or a face, I mean, are
we going--

3410
03:48:34,125 --> 03:48:35,125
LIAM: Oh, he had such a face. I will never forget
this face.

3411
03:48:35,125 --> 03:48:37,146
(laughter)

3412
03:48:37,146 --> 03:48:40,193
MARISHA: We'll beat his ass later.

3413
03:48:41,221 --> 03:48:42,184
LIAM: Maybe.

3414
03:48:42,184 --> 03:48:43,506
MARISHA: We'll beat his ass later.

3415
03:48:43,506 --> 03:48:45,633
TALIESIN: Well, it's inevitable if you kick a cat
you're going to end badly. That's just how it

3416
03:48:45,633 --> 03:48:46,691
works.

3417
03:48:46,691 --> 03:48:49,938
LIAM: I mean you might as well be at home picking
the wings off flies, you kick a cat, what is wrong

3418
03:48:49,938 --> 03:48:51,296
with you?

3419
03:48:51,296 --> 03:48:54,900
LAURA: Wait a minute, is it wrong to pick wings
off flies? Because that's not--

3420
03:48:54,900 --> 03:48:56,905
TRAVIS: That's really hard to do, very small and
hard to catch.

3421
03:48:56,905 --> 03:48:59,899
LAURA: Not if they're already dead, then you can
pick the wings off super duper easily.

3422
03:48:59,899 --> 03:49:01,891
TALIESIN: Oh sure, if they're already dead, just
go for it.

3423
03:49:01,891 --> 03:49:05,355
MARISHA: You know what we used to do as kids, we
used to take fireflies and crush them and make

3424
03:49:05,355 --> 03:49:09,954
glow jewelry. When they'd light up, and you'd
crush them right as they light up, and then you

3425
03:49:09,954 --> 03:49:12,083
can make glowing war paint.

3426
03:49:12,083 --> 03:49:13,479
LAURA: What's a firefly?

3427
03:49:13,479 --> 03:49:15,628
MARISHA: It's a thing that happens on the east
coast.

3428
03:49:15,628 --> 03:49:17,029
TRAVIS: And in the south.

3429
03:49:17,029 --> 03:49:18,782
MARISHA: Yeah, it's a southern thing.

3430
03:49:18,782 --> 03:49:19,915
LIAM: And in New Jersey.

3431
03:49:19,915 --> 03:49:21,102
LAURA: Oh wow.

3432
03:49:21,102 --> 03:49:23,399
TALIESIN: Is this a thing that really happens?

3433
03:49:23,399 --> 03:49:26,936
LIAM: On second thought, who am I to judge? It's
fine! You know, Frumpkin will be back tomorrow

3434
03:49:27,045 --> 03:49:30,977
morning because I am going to stay up late and do
what I have to do, but aren't we going to have a

3435
03:49:30,977 --> 03:49:34,208
rager tonight at this place in the fancy part of
town?

3436
03:49:34,208 --> 03:49:39,710
LAURA: Oh yeah, we can go back to the Pillow Trove
and all hang out and sleep in the same room if you want.

3437
03:49:39,801 --> 03:49:45,562
TRAVIS: Wait, so we all just got clean and we're
going to get back into the sewers to get to the Tri-Spires?

3438
03:49:46,171 --> 03:49:49,200
SAM: Is this room that you rented gigantic?

3439
03:49:49,200 --> 03:49:54,266
LAURA: No, it's kind of little, actually. You
guys, it's really little, actually.

3440
03:49:54,266 --> 03:49:55,577
LIAM: But really nice, you said?

3441
03:49:55,577 --> 03:49:56,786
MARISHA: But you paid for it!

3442
03:49:56,786 --> 03:50:01,793
LIAM: You paid for it! You know, you don't want it
to go to waste. There's probably a very nice

3443
03:50:01,793 --> 03:50:06,759
sitting room or tavern or something underneath
this place. It's a shame to let it go to waste.

3444
03:50:06,759 --> 03:50:11,515
LAURA: Yeah we all look nice enough, they might
let us in. If not, let's all go--

3445
03:50:11,515 --> 03:50:12,651
ASHLEY: Kill them.

3446
03:50:12,651 --> 03:50:13,722
LAURA: Yeah.

3447
03:50:13,722 --> 03:50:14,836
SAM: What? What?

3448
03:50:14,836 --> 03:50:16,298
ASHLEY: I'm kidding.

3449
03:50:16,298 --> 03:50:17,516
SAM: Oh, okay.

3450
03:50:17,516 --> 03:50:22,121
LAURA: Sure, we walk back to the guards and I show
them the key. Can we get in?

3451
03:50:22,121 --> 03:50:28,257
MATT: For the sake of brevity? Since it's getting
late and I want us to get to a good ending point

3452
03:50:28,257 --> 03:50:32,403
tonight, they will let you in but nobody else.

3453
03:50:32,403 --> 03:50:36,583
TALIESIN: But she paid for the whole night with
all of us!

3454
03:50:36,583 --> 03:50:39,009
MARISHA: It's a posse!

3455
03:50:39,009 --> 03:50:41,481
TALIESIN: I try to look him right in the eye when
I say that.

3456
03:50:41,481 --> 03:50:46,181
MATT: It's not the same guards you met before, and
they take your key but they look towards the

3457
03:50:46,181 --> 03:50:54,237
rather rough-looking, large, scary barbarian
woman, they look towards the very shifty-looking

3458
03:50:54,237 --> 03:51:02,529
multicolored tiefling they look past the, while he
is wearing a cloak, still rough, grimy-looking

3459
03:51:02,529 --> 03:51:14,494
wizard, and they begin to fixate directly on the
tiny green, but white mask-skinned halfling

3460
03:51:14,494 --> 03:51:19,615
creature thing in earmuffs that's squinting very
hard and they begin to really pry in that

3461
03:51:19,615 --> 03:51:22,758
direction before you start thinking this is not
going to go well if I keep going--

3462
03:51:22,758 --> 03:51:24,530
LAURA: All right.

3463
03:51:24,530 --> 03:51:32,049
MARISHA: Well, maybe-- Don't let us hold you down,
if you want to go enjoy?

3464
03:51:32,049 --> 03:51:36,570
LAURA: Oh, I don't really want to stay in there
alone.

3465
03:51:36,570 --> 03:51:38,821
TRAVIS: How about we dive bar it tonight, then?

3466
03:51:38,821 --> 03:51:40,765
MARISHA: Being alone is sucky, right?

3467
03:51:40,765 --> 03:51:42,150
TALIESIN: Roll for random bar.

3468
03:51:44,350 --> 03:51:46,015
MATT: You know one dive.

3469
03:51:46,105 --> 03:51:47,906
LAURA: The Evening Nip.

3470
03:51:47,906 --> 03:51:52,339
TALIESIN: No work, let's go make an ass of
ourselves at the Evening Nip.

3471
03:51:52,339 --> 03:51:58,268
MARISHA: Okay, no questions. Just scouting them
out. Yeah yeah.

3472
03:51:58,268 --> 03:52:00,493
TALIESIN: Scout it out. I think that's a great
idea.

3473
03:52:00,493 --> 03:52:04,000
LIAM: (singing) Bar wars, nothing but bar wars!

3474
03:52:04,000 --> 03:52:12,094
MATT: All righty. Let me pull this up real fast.
Easy enough to find! You head to another section

3475
03:52:12,094 --> 03:52:14,253
of the Interstead sprawl--

3476
03:52:14,253 --> 03:52:15,353
MARISHA: Have we been here yet?

3477
03:52:15,353 --> 03:52:27,598
MATT: No, you have not been. You come to what is a
small, dark-wood, rough and tumble dive bar with

3478
03:52:27,598 --> 03:52:32,503
two very dangerous-looking guards at the outside.
You see these thicker human guys, one who is

3479
03:52:32,503 --> 03:52:38,925
completely bald, pale skin, big square chin that
looks like it's been broken in multiple places who

3480
03:52:38,925 --> 03:52:43,562
has his arms crossed. The other one looks to be a
spindly guy who's sitting there, daggers sheathed

3481
03:52:43,562 --> 03:52:48,532
on both sides, and they both watch you as you
enter and they both just stare.

3482
03:52:48,532 --> 03:52:52,185
MARISHA: They're bouncers, like rough bouncers at
that bar.

3483
03:52:52,185 --> 03:52:56,364
MATT: Yeah. Which is interesting, because you
expect for them to go through that it would be a

3484
03:52:56,364 --> 03:53:05,108
really rowdy place but it's very quiet. You walk
inside and aside from the central candle-lit

3485
03:53:05,108 --> 03:53:15,597
chandelier that is almost obtrusively laid from a
low ceiling with a number of small booths that are

3486
03:53:15,597 --> 03:53:22,225
built out of wood as well, it has a classic
Old-England pub feel, but everything smells of

3487
03:53:22,225 --> 03:53:30,028
dried beers and ale and rotted wood. You only see
two other patrons in there that are at separate

3488
03:53:30,028 --> 03:53:38,729
booths drinking alone, and across the way you see
this very, very old dwarf with half of his beard

3489
03:53:38,729 --> 03:53:44,684
burned away and this perpetual grimace. He's
sitting there looking out. As you enter, he perks

3490
03:53:44,684 --> 03:53:49,621
up, "Aye. Can I help you?"

3491
03:53:51,342 --> 03:53:52,645
MARISHA: He's the bartender?

3492
03:53:52,645 --> 03:53:53,588
MATT: Yeah.

3493
03:53:55,063 --> 03:53:58,569
MARISHA: We'll take a round of your house ale, if
you don't mind.

3494
03:53:58,569 --> 03:54:03,970
TRAVIS: Start a tab, we're looking to tie one on
tonight. We're celebrating.

3495
03:54:03,970 --> 03:54:07,378
MATT: "If I can ask what you're celebrating?"

3496
03:54:07,378 --> 03:54:11,234
TRAVIS: Killed a fucking giant invisible spider,
friend.

3497
03:54:11,234 --> 03:54:18,829
MATT: "That's a pretty good reason to celebrate.
Drinks coming right up." He goes and gets you guys

3498
03:54:18,829 --> 03:54:26,843
a number of drinks. The basest, most bitter ale
you've had, but it's functional.

3499
03:54:26,843 --> 03:54:29,661
TRAVIS: I appreciate that. Can I ask your name?

3500
03:54:29,661 --> 03:54:31,885
MATT: "They call me Clive."

3501
03:54:31,885 --> 03:54:34,010
MARISHA: Clive.

3502
03:54:34,010 --> 03:54:38,049
MATT: "Clive Bens, and this is my bar."

3503
03:54:38,049 --> 03:54:40,130
TRAVIS: Nice to meet you, Clive.

3504
03:54:40,130 --> 03:54:42,523
MATT: "Pleasure as well."

3505
03:54:44,433 --> 03:54:47,656
TRAVIS: Noticed some tough-looking types out
front.

3506
03:54:48,607 --> 03:54:57,194
MATT: "Never be too careful. Dangerous times.
Riots breaking out in the cities in the empire.

3507
03:54:57,443 --> 03:55:02,119
Folks coming through, you got to be prepared.
Don't want to be taken advantage of."

3508
03:55:02,119 --> 03:55:03,768
MARISHA: You been hit by any riots?

3509
03:55:03,768 --> 03:55:08,205
MATT: "No, but that's why. I keep my front." His
eyes are locked in on you.

3510
03:55:08,205 --> 03:55:09,882
MARISHA: I was about to say, why--

3511
03:55:09,882 --> 03:55:12,021
TRAVIS: I know, I know!

3512
03:55:12,021 --> 03:55:14,582
LAURA: Does he look, like, mean at Fjord?

3513
03:55:14,582 --> 03:55:17,133
MATT: No, it's just kind of creepy.

3514
03:55:17,133 --> 03:55:19,142
TRAVIS: He's just locked in.

3515
03:55:19,142 --> 03:55:22,377
MARISHA: Hey, is green your favorite color or
something?

3516
03:55:22,377 --> 03:55:26,582
MATT: "Sorry, just don't get a lot of your types in
here."

3517
03:55:28,413 --> 03:55:30,798
LAURA: What is his type?

3518
03:55:32,318 --> 03:55:33,964
TRAVIS: Orc-ish blood.

3519
03:55:34,657 --> 03:55:36,471
MATT: "Pretty."

3520
03:55:36,729 --> 03:55:39,929
LAURA: Pretty! See, Fjord, you're just so
handsome.

3521
03:55:39,929 --> 03:55:45,948
TRAVIS: Thank you, Jester. Clive, we're not
looking for any trouble.

3522
03:55:45,948 --> 03:55:53,288
MATT: "Then don't start any. Finish your drinks.
Enjoy." He slips them out.

3523
03:55:53,288 --> 03:55:55,289
MARISHA: Thanks, man.

3524
03:55:55,289 --> 03:55:56,990
SAM: This place sucks.

3525
03:55:56,990 --> 03:56:00,503
LAURA: Yeah, maybe not the best place to
celebrate, just putting it out there.

3526
03:56:00,503 --> 03:56:02,646
LIAM: That guy is socially awkward.

3527
03:56:02,646 --> 03:56:06,125
TRAVIS: Is there any music or is it just low
murmured conversation?

3528
03:56:06,125 --> 03:56:09,862
MATT: There's no conversation. Two people at
separate booths that are drinking by themselves

3529
03:56:09,862 --> 03:56:11,591
and they're all looking at you.

3530
03:56:11,591 --> 03:56:12,922
MARISHA: Yeah, what do they look like?

3531
03:56:12,922 --> 03:56:15,832
TRAVIS: We walked into the Russian Mafia!

3532
03:56:15,832 --> 03:56:18,613
MARISHA: Yeah we did! This is a mob bar.

3533
03:56:18,623 --> 03:56:20,511
LIAM: This is Fight Club, really.

3534
03:56:20,591 --> 03:56:24,048
TRAVIS: Do you have a menu? You don't, you don't.

3535
03:56:24,048 --> 03:56:32,509
MARISHA: Do you have any beers on tap? Oh no, just
the two? Okay. Interesting. Feels like this is a front.

3536
03:56:32,592 --> 03:56:43,300
MATT: There's two other guys, one of them is a
younger, plump human male, has a tuft of a red and

3537
03:56:43,300 --> 03:56:51,091
grey goatee at the end of his chin. No hair on top
of his head. The other guy looks to be human as

3538
03:56:51,091 --> 03:56:58,309
well, he's older in his forties, he glances over
at you, he's clutching a tankard, and you can see

3539
03:56:58,309 --> 03:57:02,342
he has a very familiar tattoo around his neck.

3540
03:57:02,342 --> 03:57:05,156
TRAVIS: The tattoo is familiar or he's familiar?

3541
03:57:05,156 --> 03:57:08,078
MATT: The tattoo. It's not him, but it's the
tattoo.

3542
03:57:08,356 --> 03:57:10,855
LIAM: Show me your tats.

3543
03:57:10,855 --> 03:57:16,379
MATT: Yeah. You don't know if it's directly the
same, but it's a similar tattoo to Thed who you

3544
03:57:16,379 --> 03:57:17,864
met earlier.

3545
03:57:17,864 --> 03:57:20,636
LAURA: Maybe you should ask him about his tattoos
since you have tattoos as well.

3546
03:57:20,636 --> 03:57:24,828
TALIESIN: Just because someone has tattoos doesn't
mean they know everyone who has a tattoo. These

3547
03:57:24,828 --> 03:57:26,678
are very different tattoos.

3548
03:57:26,678 --> 03:57:31,371
TRAVIS: Does the floor look barren? Wood? Any
rugs, coverings?

3549
03:57:31,371 --> 03:57:33,143
LIAM: How big is this place?

3550
03:57:33,143 --> 03:57:40,492
MATT: This place is maybe 20 feet by 30 feet. It's
very small. The floor appears to be wood boards,

3551
03:57:40,492 --> 03:57:47,149
there are a couple doors that leave into a kitchen
or storage area. It's a tiny fucking dive.

3552
03:57:47,149 --> 03:57:50,515
LAURA: Like, unless we're going to do this we
should get out.

3553
03:57:50,515 --> 03:57:53,168
SAM: Should we just do this, then?

3554
03:57:53,168 --> 03:57:54,807
TRAVIS: We did a little recon.

3555
03:57:54,807 --> 03:57:59,026
MARISHA: Yeah. Maybe we finish our drink and move
on for now.

3556
03:57:59,026 --> 03:58:02,144
LAURA: Just go back to The Leaky Tap and then, you
know.

3557
03:58:02,144 --> 03:58:03,891
TALIESIN: We learned something today.

3558
03:58:03,891 --> 03:58:07,184
TRAVIS: Have we slept after our spider bite?

3559
03:58:07,184 --> 03:58:11,061
MATT: You guys finish your terrible ale, and you
leave.

3560
03:58:11,061 --> 03:58:13,207
LAURA: This is awful, and I don't want it.

3561
03:58:13,207 --> 03:58:15,854
MARISHA: I pound it for her.

3562
03:58:15,854 --> 03:58:20,072
MATT: "Thanks for coming by, have a good night."

3563
03:58:20,072 --> 03:58:22,306
LAURA: Thank you, Clive Bens!

3564
03:58:22,306 --> 03:58:26,235
MATT: You guys leave, and the two guards watch you
leave.

3565
03:58:26,235 --> 03:58:28,593
ASHLEY: Nobody wants to stay?

3566
03:58:28,593 --> 03:58:31,659
(laughter)

3567
03:58:31,659 --> 03:58:34,173
SAM: Do you want to stay, Yasha? I'll stay with
you if you want.

3568
03:58:34,173 --> 03:58:36,029
ASHLEY: I quite like it here.

3569
03:58:36,029 --> 03:58:40,945
MATT: I'm thirsty and have been out of water and I
keep going to drink nothing that's there. I do it

3570
03:58:40,945 --> 03:58:42,639
so much and I hate it!

3571
03:58:42,639 --> 03:58:44,935
MARISHA: Can someone fly us in some water for the
DM?

3572
03:58:44,935 --> 03:58:47,954
MATT: It's fine! Because as you--

3573
03:58:47,954 --> 03:58:49,617
TRAVIS: Are these your type of people?

3574
03:58:49,617 --> 03:58:51,390
ASHLEY: I do like these people a lot.

3575
03:58:51,390 --> 03:58:52,844
LIAM: Let's play for another six hours.

3576
03:58:52,844 --> 03:58:57,045
TALIESIN: Six more hours? Let's make it so they
have to break this into like five YouTube videos.

3577
03:58:57,045 --> 03:58:58,026
MATT: Do you guys leave?

3578
03:58:58,026 --> 03:58:59,879
SAM: Yes, we leave. Take it away, Matt.

3579
03:58:59,879 --> 03:59:02,428
MATT: Okay. You gather your things up you leave
out into the street to go onto the next leg of

3580
03:59:02,428 --> 03:59:04,409
your evening adventure and that's where we'll
close tonight's episode.

3581
03:59:04,409 --> 03:59:06,104
(groaning)

3582
03:59:06,104 --> 03:59:10,327
MATT: It is 11:00, we'll pick up next week as you
guys are leaving the Evening Nip to whatever other

3583
03:59:10,327 --> 03:59:13,148
business you want to go towards.

3584
03:59:13,148 --> 03:59:15,601
MARISHA: We learned so much today, you guys.

3585
03:59:15,601 --> 03:59:17,314
TALIESIN: I feel like we all grew as people.

3586
03:59:17,314 --> 03:59:19,224
LIAM: I don't want to stop!

3587
03:59:19,224 --> 03:59:21,594
LAURA: I know, I feel like it's just at home
and we can just like--

3588
03:59:21,594 --> 03:59:24,405
MARISHA: Keep going. Feel like we were on a roll!

3589
03:59:24,405 --> 03:59:26,593
ASHLEY: Can we do it just us at home?

3590
03:59:26,694 --> 03:59:30,241
TRAVIS: With some quiches, and some mimosas--

3591
03:59:30,241 --> 03:59:32,365
MARISHA: Some lox and bagels!

3592
03:59:32,365 --> 03:59:38,369
MATT: I feel like it would be wonderful, and I
feel like there would be a lot of very angry,

3593
03:59:38,369 --> 03:59:39,793
disappointed people.

3594
03:59:39,793 --> 03:59:41,275
LIAM: Charlie the dog.

3595
03:59:41,275 --> 03:59:42,953
TALIESIN: Charlie farting in the corner.

3596
03:59:42,953 --> 03:59:44,378
LAURA: He's so stinky now.

3597
03:59:44,378 --> 03:59:46,673
MATT: I know, he's old and stinky!

3598
03:59:46,801 --> 03:59:49,522
SAM: "My name is Clive Bens."

3599
03:59:49,527 --> 03:59:52,072
(laughter)

3600
03:59:52,072 --> 03:59:59,372
That was the roughest of old biker bars. 
All right, guys. Thank you so much

3601
03:59:59,507 --> 04:00:04,313
always a pleasure. Pick this up next
week, wish it was sooner! You guys, thank you so

3602
04:00:04,313 --> 04:00:08,179
much, have a wonderful night, we'll see you on the
internet. Until then--

3603
04:00:08,179 --> 04:00:14,642
SAM: Yeah if anyone wants to come see me sing a
cappella at the University of Virginia on Saturday night--

3604
04:00:14,642 --> 04:00:16,320
ALL: What?!

3605
04:00:16,320 --> 04:00:17,840
SAM: Anyway, good night, guys!

3606
04:00:17,840 --> 04:00:19,286
ALL: What?!

3607
04:00:19,286 --> 04:00:25,862
LIAM: That's not a surprise! Sam has deep a
cappella roots! You all know that!

3608
04:00:26,461 --> 04:00:29,883
SAM: I'll be performing in a college a cappella
concert on Saturday night.

3609
04:00:29,883 --> 04:00:31,145
TALIESIN: You are not.

3610
04:00:31,145 --> 04:00:32,355
LAURA: That's so cool!

3611
04:00:32,355 --> 04:00:33,302
MARISHA: Where in Virginia?

3612
04:00:33,302 --> 04:00:34,692
SAM: Charlottesville.

3613
04:00:34,692 --> 04:00:36,060
LIAM: What's the address, though?

3614
04:00:36,060 --> 04:00:37,519
SAM: I don't know the address.

3615
04:00:37,519 --> 04:00:39,213
TRAVIS: University of Virginia, you'll find it.

3616
04:00:39,213 --> 04:00:44,708
MATT: And on that note, folks, have a wonderful
night, and is it Thursday yet? Good night.

3617
04:00:52,502 --> 04:13:24,939
[music]
