00:00:00,288 --> 00:00:04,119
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:04,119 --> 00:00:10,189
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Some of us are mentally

3
00:00:10,189 --> 00:00:18,179
lagging a little, but that's okay. It's been a
long day. Welcome, guys. Before we jump into

4
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:22,497
tonight's session, we're going to do some quick
announcements. First and foremost, thank you to

5
00:00:22,497 --> 00:00:28,184
our returning sponsor and partner at the start of
this campaign, and for the foreseeable, amorphous

6
00:00:28,184 --> 00:00:33,658
future of which they wish to come along with us on
this journey, D&amp;D Beyond. They've been awesome and

7
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:36,806
I actually just learned today of a really helpful
functionality that I probably should have known

8
00:00:36,806 --> 00:00:41,110
about, where you can create your own campaign in
there and then send out a link to all your players

9
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,843
and their characters get added to your campaign.
Now I have access to all of your character sheets

10
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:48,971
at all times, which alleviates me having to text
you all, "What's your maximum hit points now?" and

11
00:00:48,971 --> 00:00:49,928
all that shit.

12
00:00:49,928 --> 00:00:53,358
LAURA: Did you just have them? Or do we need to
send you our characters?

13
00:00:53,358 --> 00:00:55,876
MATT: Well no, I sent out the link earlier today
and you're one of the only ones who hasn't

14
00:00:55,876 --> 00:00:58,456
responded yet, but you will, later, that's okay.

15
00:00:58,456 --> 00:01:00,624
LAURA: I didn't see it, I was recording.

16
00:01:00,624 --> 00:01:02,342
MATT: That's okay, so were we.

17
00:01:02,342 --> 00:01:06,001
(laughter)

18
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:07,531
LAURA: I didn't look at my phone.

19
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:08,633
TRAVIS: What a dick.

20
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:10,913
(laughter)

21
00:01:10,913 --> 00:01:12,380
MATT: It's all good.

22
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,493
LAURA: That means all of you guys were texting in
your sessions.

23
00:01:14,493 --> 00:01:15,839
TALIESIN: This is true.

24
00:01:15,839 --> 00:01:17,433
LIAM: We're that good.

25
00:01:17,433 --> 00:01:20,570
(laughter)

26
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,076
MATT: Sam, do you have any words you wanted to say
about our sponsor?

27
00:01:23,076 --> 00:01:25,232
SAM: I do. Here, give this to Matt, he'll need it.

28
00:01:25,232 --> 00:01:26,173
MATT: Oh no.

29
00:01:26,173 --> 00:01:30,789
SAM: Our partner this week is once again D&amp;D
Beyond, that's dndbeyond.com. The big news is that

30
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:37,138
D&amp;D's newest book, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes, is
available for pre-order now on the site. If you

31
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:42,107
preorder, you'll get exclusive character portrait
frames, sheet backdrops, and themed colors that you

32
00:01:42,107 --> 00:01:46,742
can use with upcoming character sheet updates! I
don't know what that means but it sounds awesome.

33
00:01:46,742 --> 00:01:53,950
The $10 off code "beginnings" can be applied to
your preorder. To celebrate, I'm going to

34
00:01:53,950 --> 00:02:00,702
personally be giving away one copy of this book to
either Travis, Liam, or Marisha, but they have to

35
00:02:00,702 --> 00:02:05,459
compete for it. Here's the rules: I'm going to
give you a race, class, and character description,

36
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:11,812
just like you can do on D&amp;D Beyond, and all you
guys have to do is come up with the name of that

37
00:02:11,812 --> 00:02:20,116
character. Laura, Taliesin, and Matt will be the
judges. Best out of three wins, all right? You

38
00:02:20,116 --> 00:02:25,003
just have to come up with a name for this
character, ready? A male stout halfling swamp

39
00:02:25,003 --> 00:02:31,427
druid who only wears a diaper made out of kelp and
loves to Wild Shape into manatees. Liam, what is

40
00:02:31,427 --> 00:02:32,703
the name of that character?

41
00:02:32,703 --> 00:02:34,091
LIAM: Twill Pillikins.

42
00:02:34,091 --> 00:02:35,771
SAM: Marisha, what is the name of that character?

43
00:02:35,771 --> 00:02:37,431
MARISHA: Squall Squatlock.

44
00:02:37,431 --> 00:02:38,455
SAM: And Travis?

45
00:02:38,455 --> 00:02:39,631
TRAVIS: Merkin Dullbringer.

46
00:02:39,631 --> 00:02:47,459
SAM: Judges, who wins? Oh, Travis, easy win for
Travis.

47
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,648
MATT: Adding Merkin to a swamp druid was too
easy.

48
00:02:49,648 --> 00:02:52,270
LAURA: It was you, Liam, until he brought up the
Merkin.

49
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:56,286
SAM: Remember, these characters can all be made on
D&amp;D Beyond. The next one is a male tabaxi bard

50
00:02:56,286 --> 00:03:02,921
with an electric guitar who constantly plays K-pop
songs and has a runny nose. What is his name? Liam O'Brien.

51
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:04,864
LIAM: Bathtub Stealthcat.

52
00:03:04,864 --> 00:03:08,075
SAM: Marisha Ray. Oh yeah, sorry, three names.

53
00:03:08,075 --> 00:03:15,636
MARISHA: Mollysquawk the J-pop Hadockhop.

54
00:03:15,636 --> 00:03:17,202
SAM: Yep, okay. Travis?

55
00:03:17,202 --> 00:03:18,415
TRAVIS: Pubert Pimplepop.

56
00:03:18,415 --> 00:03:19,897
SAM: Ooh! Judges.

57
00:03:19,897 --> 00:03:21,504
TALIESIN: I got bribed.

58
00:03:21,504 --> 00:03:25,293
SAM: Travis again.

59
00:03:25,293 --> 00:03:27,857
TALIESIN: I'm purchasable, putting that out
there.

60
00:03:27,857 --> 00:03:33,186
SAM: One more, this one is worth two points. A
female kenku paladin with no arms or legs.

61
00:03:33,186 --> 00:03:34,594
LAURA: What's a kenku?

62
00:03:34,594 --> 00:03:35,917
LIAM: Kenku's a bird.

63
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:37,841
LAURA: Yeah, I know. Shut up!

64
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:43,793
SAM: Who worships the lobster-headed god
Blibdoolpoolp, and it is a real god, and is

65
00:03:43,793 --> 00:03:48,331
dragged around by a pack of reindeer. Liam, what
is the name of that character?

66
00:03:48,331 --> 00:03:50,299
LIAM: Dagon Henry Kissinger.

67
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:56,886
MARISHA: Madame Mannequin Ba-Deece.

68
00:03:56,886 --> 00:04:00,949
TRAVIS: Filma Kraken.

69
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:10,078
SAM: Judges, Liam, Liam, Marisha, Liam gets two
points! Travis gets two points! Marisha wins!

70
00:04:10,078 --> 00:04:12,838
MARISHA: Yay, golf rules!

71
00:04:12,838 --> 00:04:20,183
SAM: I will personally buy you one of those books,
Marisha, hold me to it. D&amp;D Beyond, everyone, make

72
00:04:20,183 --> 00:04:22,099
your character today.

73
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:23,771
MATT: Thank you Sam, thank you very much.

74
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:24,769
LAURA: That was good.

75
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:26,110
TALIESIN: That got weird.

76
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,570
MATT: Isn't it always, though?

77
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,640
LAURA: That was close, I'm not going to count it.
This is the one Sam gave me, so we'll see.

78
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:37,669
MATT: Finishing up from that, we have Talks Machina
next Tuesday at 7:00pm Pacific here on Twitch and

79
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:44,232
Project Alpha to discuss tonight's episode of
Critical Role hosted by our fantastic Brian W.

80
00:04:44,232 --> 00:04:50,151
Foster, so check that out on Tuesday next week. We
have a new show called Weave coming up, Marisha, do

81
00:04:50,151 --> 00:04:51,099
you want to explain this a little bit?

82
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:52,616
TALIESIN: We're one episode in.

83
00:04:52,616 --> 00:04:55,072
MATT: One episode in? That's right, that launched this
week.

84
00:04:55,072 --> 00:04:57,081
MARISHA: Yeah, it happened... last night?

85
00:04:57,081 --> 00:04:58,310
TALIESIN: Wednesday night.

86
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:05,916
MARISHA: Wednesday night, it happens after
Wednesday Club. It's being GMed by Amy Dallen and

87
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:16,417
it's an interactive storytelling RPG game. It's
got all the ladies of Geek &amp; Sundry, so check it out.

88
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:17,813
MATT: That's awesome.

89
00:05:17,813 --> 00:05:19,821
TRAVIS: That's a dope jacket, by the way.

90
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:21,122
MARISHA: Thanks, man.

91
00:05:21,122 --> 00:05:22,424
TRAVIS: Yeah, jealous.

92
00:05:22,424 --> 00:05:29,290
MATT: We'll get you one, same size. Last week's
episode of Critical Role is available in podcast

93
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:34,222
form wherever you can find the greatest podcasts to
download. So if you have friends who are listening

94
00:05:34,222 --> 00:05:40,409
to the audio, they can do so now and be caught up
with you up until after tonight. Also, comic book

95
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:44,668
issue four of Critical Role: Vox Machina Origins
is available for digital download anywhere where you can

96
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:48,955
find digital comics for the most part: ComiXology,
the Dark Horse app, and other great places.

97
00:05:48,997 --> 00:05:53,682
TRAVIS: It's so good, Minxie's in there killing things.

98
00:05:53,682 --> 00:05:56,179
MATT: We've got a new one creeping up on the
horizon.

99
00:05:56,179 --> 00:05:58,385
LIAM: I've read the whole thing, I've seen the
pictures.

100
00:05:58,385 --> 00:06:07,016
MATT: I was supposed to see the art today! I can't
wait! Anyway, enough of that. Of course, our

101
00:06:07,016 --> 00:06:14,598
fantastic 826LA and the 826 group that does
fantastic after-school programs for kids to get

102
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:19,629
into creative writing. Check it out if you haven't
already, and if you can't give to help out with

103
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:23,379
this charity, you can donate your time as well to
help teach some of these kids and help expand

104
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:27,670
their imaginations, so check it out. They're
awesome people and we continue to support and push

105
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:33,513
them forward. Any new appearances you want to
announce? Or just rinse and repeat the ones-- if

106
00:06:33,513 --> 00:06:36,879
you want to know what conventions we're going to
be at in the near future, watch last week's

107
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:44,237
episode. Otherwise it gets monotonous for us.
Anyway, any other announcements that I've missed?

108
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,894
SAM: Apparently my breath stinks, so if anyone has
any gum, I'll take it.

109
00:06:47,894 --> 00:06:52,474
MATT: Send your gum to Geek &amp; Sundry.

110
00:06:52,474 --> 00:06:54,643
TALIESIN: Don't send your gum.

111
00:06:54,643 --> 00:07:04,324
LAURA: I have something. The Shadow of War
expansion pack, The Blade of Galadriel, came out

112
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:09,091
and you can play and be me, so get it and play.

113
00:07:09,091 --> 00:07:10,844
SAM: Just you, Laura Bailey?

114
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:13,741
LAURA: Yeah, basically just me, running around
Mordor.

115
00:07:13,741 --> 00:07:16,990
LIAM: Donut hole! Donut hole! Donut
hole!

116
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,615
TRAVIS: You've got a ring of power and shit.

117
00:07:19,615 --> 00:07:21,127
LAURA: Yeah, so check it out.

118
00:07:21,127 --> 00:07:22,858
LIAM: She has a ring of power?

119
00:07:22,858 --> 00:07:25,477
LAURA: Shut up! What? No. What?

120
00:07:25,477 --> 00:07:34,599
MATT: On that note, let's go ahead and dive in to
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

121
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:36,862
(cast singing)

122
00:07:36,862 --> 00:07:40,739
[click, TV static]

123
00:07:40,739 --> 00:08:58,379
[groovy Critical Role theme]

124
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,877
MATT: And welcome back.

125
00:08:59,877 --> 00:09:01,899
LAURA: He just tunes it out now.

126
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:03,400
MATT: I have to.

127
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,463
LIAM: Except when he doesn't.

128
00:09:04,463 --> 00:09:07,514
MATT: Except when I don't, which makes it a
challenge for you guys, which does not help me.

129
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:14,343
Anyway, last we left off, the group of adventurers
whose fates are slowly entwining found themselves

130
00:09:14,343 --> 00:09:18,535
meeting in the city of Trostenwald on the southern
reaches of the Dwendalian Empire on the continent

131
00:09:18,535 --> 00:09:24,019
of Wildemount. Through a mishap in a circus
passing through town, you began to give chase to

132
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:30,644
the investigation that has caught you up in this legal
issue and you found yourselves locked under house

133
00:09:30,644 --> 00:09:36,598
arrest and being considered possible murderers.
You sought the answer to this endeavor, you found

134
00:09:36,598 --> 00:09:41,818
the devil toad, or the nergaliid, as you
discovered, was responsible. You hunted it down,

135
00:09:41,818 --> 00:09:46,024
slew it, brought its head back, and after arguing
with a very tired and wanting to get it over with

136
00:09:46,024 --> 00:09:52,542
lawmaster in Trostenwald, managed to convince her
enough to let you off the hook and leave most of

137
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:56,762
the standing legal issues with Gustav, thus
disbanding the circus and setting you and Yasha

138
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:01,881
free. Yasha went on her own path while the rest of
you, the six of you, decided strength in numbers,

139
00:10:01,881 --> 00:10:06,745
and at the time being, you all seem to enjoy each
other's company. Purchasing a fresh

140
00:10:06,745 --> 00:10:13,226
map, looking at your future prospects and your
dwindling funds, you decided to head northward,

141
00:10:13,226 --> 00:10:19,421
towards the city of Zadash by way of the Golden
Road, past the city of Alfield. And that is where

142
00:10:19,421 --> 00:10:25,818
we left off, as you had smacked the rear end of
the single horse and cart, and sent it spooked

143
00:10:25,818 --> 00:10:27,860
into the northern field.

144
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,810
LAURA: We chased after it, right?

145
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,971
MATT: You do. You chase after it to keep up.

146
00:10:33,971 --> 00:10:36,016
LAURA: We don't just lose it.

147
00:10:36,016 --> 00:10:45,537
MATT: Being relatively before noon at this point
in time, you're heading northward along the Amber

148
00:10:45,537 --> 00:10:49,517
Road. The well-packed dirt of the ten-foot roadway
gives you a clear path towards your next

149
00:10:49,517 --> 00:10:54,558
destination. The gentle creak of the cart mingles
with the clomping of the horse hooves as you push

150
00:10:54,558 --> 00:11:00,458
forward. The midday air is warmer than you
expected. The sky's common gray presence is broken

151
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:06,786
into smaller cloud patches, the victorious blue
peeking through. You guys continue for a few hours,

152
00:11:06,786 --> 00:11:12,421
talking amongst yourselves a bit. If there are any
questions you wish to ask each other, now is

153
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,385
the time.

154
00:11:14,385 --> 00:11:16,171
SAM: Any questions?

155
00:11:16,171 --> 00:11:19,317
MATT: Meaning if there is anything coming out of
the city you wanted to talk about, otherwise I'm

156
00:11:19,317 --> 00:11:22,330
going to continue to push forward with your
journey. So stop me at any point.

157
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:28,762
TRAVIS: Is Beau-- is her face all jibbity-jacked,
or is it pretty normal-looking at this point?

158
00:11:28,762 --> 00:11:30,677
MATT: Make a perception check.

159
00:11:30,677 --> 00:11:37,119
TRAVIS: Not that I watched anything from last week,
because I didn't! 16.

160
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:46,263
MATT: You can see there is some faint bruising
starting to show on the left side of the face.

161
00:11:46,263 --> 00:11:56,509
TRAVIS: I bet she doesn't want to talk about that.
That's a good shiner.

162
00:11:56,509 --> 00:11:59,238
MARISHA: Thanks.

163
00:11:59,238 --> 00:12:02,881
TRAVIS: Did you give as good as you got?

164
00:12:02,881 --> 00:12:15,931
MARISHA: I wouldn't say I <i>won</i>, because I lost.
But I did pretty good. What color is it right now?

165
00:12:15,931 --> 00:12:17,833
Is it in that orange-ish purple--

166
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:21,925
TRAVIS: It's got the green-yellow sunset
happening, things are starting to spread. Tomorrow

167
00:12:21,925 --> 00:12:22,957
will be--

168
00:12:22,957 --> 00:12:25,075
MARISHA: Right. Got that little orangey. Mm-hmm.

169
00:12:25,075 --> 00:12:26,628
LAURA: It's really pretty.

170
00:12:26,628 --> 00:12:27,809
MARISHA: Thanks.

171
00:12:27,809 --> 00:12:29,809
TALIESIN: Significant improvement.

172
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:36,233
TRAVIS: That trouble going to follow you as we go
on our way, or do you think you're free and clear?

173
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:47,864
MARISHA: Oh no, that was just a little bar fight.
Nothing. Just a little friendly sparring. Nothing crazy.

174
00:12:47,864 --> 00:12:49,893
TRAVIS: Nice.

175
00:12:49,893 --> 00:12:52,657
LAURA: Does anyone want a donut from my bag?

176
00:12:52,657 --> 00:12:54,144
TALIESIN: Yes, I'll have a donut, thank you,
please.

177
00:12:54,144 --> 00:12:56,252
LIAM: I would also like a donut, please.

178
00:12:56,252 --> 00:13:02,349
LAURA: Okay, here you go. I don't have them in
real life, just this one in real life. But in the

179
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:04,952
game, you guys are having delicious donuts.

180
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:07,085
TRAVIS: How old are those donuts?

181
00:13:07,085 --> 00:13:08,985
LIAM: Do you actually have donuts? I don't
understand.

182
00:13:08,985 --> 00:13:10,496
LAURA: Yeah, here you go.

183
00:13:10,496 --> 00:13:12,763
LIAM: Oh, there it is.

184
00:13:12,763 --> 00:13:14,740
MATT: Imagination!

185
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,528
LAURA: You're doing it, Peter, you're doing it!

186
00:13:17,528 --> 00:13:21,757
TALIESIN: I was just going there, damn it!
Bangarang!

187
00:13:21,757 --> 00:13:29,289
LAURA: These donuts are not <i>that</i> old.

188
00:13:29,289 --> 00:13:31,810
TALIESIN: What does "not that old" mean, does it
mean they're young?

189
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:32,987
LIAM: Are they pretty new?

190
00:13:32,987 --> 00:13:34,812
LAURA: They're pretty new, yes.

191
00:13:34,812 --> 00:13:40,409
LIAM: Three days new? Or-- Forget it, I don't
actually want to know the answer.

192
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:42,680
LAURA: Just eat it, it's good.

193
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,894
TALIESIN: Is it good and do we gain or lose hit
points?

194
00:13:45,894 --> 00:13:53,446
MATT: No hit point transition, no constitution
saves. They're a bit stale, but still tasty enough.

195
00:13:53,446 --> 00:13:57,862
TRAVIS: Any lint from the bag that they were being
held in?

196
00:13:57,862 --> 00:14:03,682
MATT: You can chose to remove it if you'd like,
but it may be part of the texture. It adds color.

197
00:14:03,682 --> 00:14:05,951
LAURA: That's right. It's like sprinkles.

198
00:14:05,951 --> 00:14:11,582
LIAM: Mollymauk, is this weird for you to not be
traveling with your performing family?

199
00:14:11,582 --> 00:14:15,612
TALIESIN: It's change, but travel is travel, so.

200
00:14:15,612 --> 00:14:20,844
LAURA: Did you travel in a wagon when you were
with your family?

201
00:14:20,844 --> 00:14:25,205
TALIESIN: Oh yes, we traveled forever. It was
constantly on the road. Once we left home, we

202
00:14:25,205 --> 00:14:27,060
stayed moving.

203
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:31,201
MATT: Ironically, traveled in the exact wagon that
you're in right now.

204
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:33,229
LAURA: Oh, nice.

205
00:14:33,229 --> 00:14:40,388
LIAM: Some things don't change. We didn't have
much of a chance to see you perform. I saw you do

206
00:14:40,388 --> 00:14:46,706
a card reading for Jester, but things got waylaid
at the circus. What do you normally do?

207
00:14:46,706 --> 00:14:53,180
TALIESIN: Oh, things. I'm not really much of a
performer, I'm more of-- Help set up. Help run the

208
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,652
shows, help make illusions, that sort of thing.

209
00:14:56,652 --> 00:14:59,532
SAM: Like a techie?

210
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:05,083
TALIESIN: I guess you could say a techie. I show
off a little bit of the sword juggling.

211
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,529
SAM: Oh!

212
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:09,244
TALIESIN: I've got some things I was working on.
Like this.

213
00:15:09,244 --> 00:15:11,622
TRAVIS: You juggling those big motherfucking
swords?

214
00:15:11,622 --> 00:15:12,777
TALIESIN: Yeah.

215
00:15:12,777 --> 00:15:16,529
MATT: You watch as he balances one on the edge of
the hand and then tosses it up and catches it as

216
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:21,407
it falls, and takes the other one and glides it
across, spins it up, catches it on his chin. On

217
00:15:21,407 --> 00:15:23,624
his nose; he makes it hop around. It's pretty
decent.

218
00:15:23,624 --> 00:15:24,696
TALIESIN: Little roll.

219
00:15:24,696 --> 00:15:26,259
LAURA: Can you swallow it?

220
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,160
MATT: Make an acrobatics check if you want to
try.

221
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,294
TALIESIN: Well, it's a curved sword. So not the
curved ones. But I could probably do a straight

222
00:15:32,294 --> 00:15:36,183
sword. I'm not going to swallow a curved sword!
That would be very complicated to pull off.

223
00:15:36,183 --> 00:15:38,724
LIAM: If anybody can do it, it's you.

224
00:15:38,724 --> 00:15:42,493
SAM: That tiefling anatomy is very strange, you
know.

225
00:15:42,493 --> 00:15:50,565
TALIESIN: I'm flexible, but not that flexible. I'm
pretty flexible. Yeah, I never nailed anything

226
00:15:50,565 --> 00:15:53,022
down for a really good act.

227
00:15:53,022 --> 00:16:02,524
MATT: A few hours into travel along the road, you
catch ahead the sight of another caravan heading

228
00:16:02,524 --> 00:16:07,483
southward in your direction. They begin to crest
over one of the hills. As you look forward, too,

229
00:16:07,483 --> 00:16:14,092
the central portion of the Marrow Valley isn't
just a smooth, constant grade. It's a series of

230
00:16:14,092 --> 00:16:19,662
rolling hills and high grasses and wheats and
grains, and a lot of wild weeds that have taken

231
00:16:19,662 --> 00:16:24,339
over the areas between bastions of civilization.

232
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:26,196
LIAM: How far away are they?

233
00:16:26,196 --> 00:16:30,655
MATT: You can see up there about maybe a half mile
or so, as they crest over one of the hills in the distance.

234
00:16:30,655 --> 00:16:36,845
LIAM: Yeah, I send Frumpkin ahead and see it, and
go blind and deaf here, so I can get a closer look

235
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:37,868
at them.

236
00:16:37,868 --> 00:16:39,056
SAM: Which is Frumpkin now?

237
00:16:39,056 --> 00:16:43,752
LIAM: Frumpkin's a sparrow at the moment. I don't
have the components to put him back to the shape

238
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,560
he prefers, which is a cat.

239
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,038
LAURA: What are the components?

240
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:54,327
LIAM: Charcoal and some incense, a kind of incense
you have to use. I'm all out. I used it all.

241
00:16:54,327 --> 00:16:55,833
TALIESIN: Not my incense.

242
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,206
LIAM: No.

243
00:16:57,206 --> 00:16:58,871
TRAVIS: Is there money involved?

244
00:16:58,871 --> 00:17:02,109
LIAM: Money? Well, you have to pay money to get
the things to do it.

245
00:17:02,109 --> 00:17:03,232
TRAVIS: Right, I'm sorry.

246
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:07,131
LIAM: He's been a couple of things before. He can
last. Anyway. Off you go.

247
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:09,082
LAURA: Have you ever made him a turtle?

248
00:17:09,082 --> 00:17:10,494
MATT: He can't hear you right now, unfortunately.

249
00:17:10,494 --> 00:17:14,127
LAURA: Have you ever made him a snake? Have you
ever made him a roach?

250
00:17:14,127 --> 00:17:17,324
SAM: He's gone to the other place. He won't be
able to respond.

251
00:17:17,324 --> 00:17:19,532
LAURA: Have you ever made him a unicorn?

252
00:17:19,532 --> 00:17:20,958
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

253
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,965
SAM: A unicorn would be really cool.

254
00:17:22,965 --> 00:17:24,697
MARISHA: That would be really cool.

255
00:17:24,697 --> 00:17:26,055
TALIESIN: I'd like to see that.

256
00:17:26,055 --> 00:17:27,705
LAURA: They exist, you know.

257
00:17:27,705 --> 00:17:29,285
TALIESIN: I didn't know that.

258
00:17:29,285 --> 00:17:30,370
LAURA: They do.

259
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:39,157
MATT: As your vision crests up with the flight of
Frumpkin, make a perception check for Frumpkin.

260
00:17:39,157 --> 00:17:45,048
LIAM: Don't fuck me, Scanlan. Oh, that's not
Scanlan, that's Percy, but you did fuck me, Percy.

261
00:17:45,048 --> 00:17:47,118
TALIESIN: I try.

262
00:17:47,118 --> 00:17:50,211
LIAM: That is very low. We'll just say it fails,
because it's a two.

263
00:17:50,211 --> 00:17:51,291
MATT: It's a two?

264
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,584
LIAM: Yeah, I rolled a two.

265
00:17:52,584 --> 00:17:56,842
MATT: Okay. I mean, at a safe enough distance to
look down, there are shapes. The most that

266
00:17:56,842 --> 00:18:01,199
Frumpkin makes out is that it looks to be six
heavy wagons.

267
00:18:01,199 --> 00:18:05,293
MARISHA and LAURA: Six?

268
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:08,424
MATT: Six heavy wagons, each being pulled by a
trio of horses.

269
00:18:08,424 --> 00:18:09,953
SAM: We can rob them.

270
00:18:09,953 --> 00:18:11,442
LIAM: 18 horses.

271
00:18:11,442 --> 00:18:13,053
TRAVIS: We should what?

272
00:18:13,053 --> 00:18:17,403
SAM: Well, we could rob them, or we could go off
the road and hide and wait for them to pass.

273
00:18:17,403 --> 00:18:19,192
LAURA: Is Frumpkin back? Do we know all these
things yet?

274
00:18:19,192 --> 00:18:20,485
SAM: Oh, we don't.

275
00:18:20,485 --> 00:18:22,319
MATT: We'll say for the purposes of this--

276
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:24,180
SAM: Pleasant day!

277
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:31,509
LIAM: I started muttering as soon as I could see
that. What they were, what I saw.

278
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:34,348
LAURA: Do they look like they're in armor? Do they
look like they're soldiers?

279
00:18:34,348 --> 00:18:36,184
SAM: He can't hear you.

280
00:18:36,184 --> 00:18:38,149
LAURA: Do they look like they're mean?

281
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:39,334
TALIESIN: Do they look like they're unicorns?

282
00:18:39,334 --> 00:18:42,489
MARISHA: Do they look like they're traders? Like
<i>traders</i>, not traitors.

283
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:43,655
SAM: He can't hear you.

284
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:47,308
LAURA: Do you see, are they carrying money? Are
they carrying people?

285
00:18:47,308 --> 00:18:55,066
SAM: He won't be able to talk to you for a while.
You see, he's not really there.

286
00:18:55,066 --> 00:19:01,774
MATT: Coming closer down the road now, the gap
between your traveling troupe and this caravan

287
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:07,450
grows smaller and smaller. All the rest of you,
I'd like to make a perception check, please. I

288
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,731
think at this point, Frumpkin has--

289
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,482
LIAM: I would've released it, yeah. He's not back,
but I released the sight.

290
00:19:11,482 --> 00:19:14,124
TRAVIS: 17.

291
00:19:14,124 --> 00:19:16,056
LIAM: Perception check?

292
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:17,288
SAM: Nine!

293
00:19:17,288 --> 00:19:18,376
TALIESIN: 20.

294
00:19:18,376 --> 00:19:19,346
MARISHA: 17.

295
00:19:19,346 --> 00:19:20,280
LAURA: Five!

296
00:19:20,366 --> 00:19:21,190
LIAM: Zwölf.

297
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:25,004
MATT: Amongst all of you guys keeping an eye out,
you look ahead and you can see the wagons are

298
00:19:25,004 --> 00:19:29,600
covered, some of them are bundled; some of them
are taller; some of them are smaller. What you do

299
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:36,159
notice is at the front of each of the wagons,
there's a figure with the reins that is in the

300
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:41,081
process of sitting there and occasionally making
sure the pace is kept relatively steady forward.

301
00:19:41,081 --> 00:19:47,480
You do see by the long robes and ornate silk
mantles of the highwaymen that are holding these

302
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:53,028
reins, you get the impression that they probably
are from the Menagerie Coast. You two in

303
00:19:53,028 --> 00:20:02,232
particular recognize, it's not well-off mercantile
clothing, but it looks like it's not rags for a

304
00:20:02,232 --> 00:20:05,724
person that makes this trek up and down the Amber
Road. Looks like they're heading southward,

305
00:20:05,724 --> 00:20:11,182
probably returning after completing some sort of a
trade run up to either Zadash or Rexxentrum and

306
00:20:11,182 --> 00:20:19,542
spaces nearby. As the gap begins to close, there's
a brief moment of chicken to see who's going to

307
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:25,773
avert the path as it's only about ten foot wide.
It would be a pretty tight fit to get both your

308
00:20:25,773 --> 00:20:29,260
troupe and their wagons past. Do you guys yield or
do you continue to push forward?

309
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:34,413
TRAVIS: I would just like to suggest we might give
way. There are six of them.

310
00:20:34,413 --> 00:20:35,578
TALIESIN: I'm fine with that.

311
00:20:35,578 --> 00:20:36,691
MARISHA: Yes, agreed.

312
00:20:36,691 --> 00:20:37,688
LAURA: Yeah.

313
00:20:37,688 --> 00:20:41,853
MATT: You guys skirt your single horse-- poor
thing is pulling this cart on its own.

314
00:20:41,853 --> 00:20:45,421
TRAVIS: We're going to kill it.

315
00:20:45,421 --> 00:20:49,453
MATT: It's not going any faster, really, than you
guys walking, necessarily.

316
00:20:49,453 --> 00:20:51,374
(laughter)

317
00:20:51,374 --> 00:20:52,897
LAURA: But we get to be lazy.

318
00:20:52,897 --> 00:20:54,495
TRAVIS: But we're not walking.

319
00:20:54,495 --> 00:20:57,423
(laughter)

320
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:01,202
MATT: Because it is not a riding horse, it is a
beast of burden, so it's about the same pace that

321
00:21:01,202 --> 00:21:07,005
you're going. As you guys pull slightly off into
the grass, the cart bumps as it hits some rocks

322
00:21:07,005 --> 00:21:14,338
and patches of dirt and thick grass. They continue
to pass, and as they do, you see the individuals.

323
00:21:14,338 --> 00:21:19,026
The one in the front has what looks to be a thick
scarf tossed over the shoulder obscuring part of

324
00:21:19,026 --> 00:21:24,590
the face, and she gives a hand salute up to you as
it passes and a bit of a head nod. As you wave your

325
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:27,669
hand frantically, a bit of eye contact is made and
continues past.

326
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:29,579
LAURA: Are you going to Nicodranas?

327
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,453
MATT: No response. The first cart continues past.

328
00:21:32,453 --> 00:21:35,020
LAURA: Hi. Hi, are you going to Nicodranas?

329
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:42,592
MATT: The next one looks over to you for a second,
the head cocked a little bit. "No, we are on our

330
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:44,234
"way to Port Zoon."

331
00:21:44,234 --> 00:21:45,642
LAURA: Oh.

332
00:21:45,642 --> 00:21:47,222
MATT: "By way of Nicodranas."

333
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,415
LAURA: Oh! Did you come from Zadash?

334
00:21:49,415 --> 00:21:54,888
MATT: "We briefly did, yes, but we are returning.
We have finished our wares and we have things to

335
00:21:54,888 --> 00:21:56,697
"bring back to sell."

336
00:21:56,697 --> 00:21:59,839
LAURA: How far is it to Zadash?

337
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:04,826
MATT: "Uh..." At this point he's passed by you and
his voice gets a bit louder over his shoulder and

338
00:22:04,826 --> 00:22:09,720
he's like, "From this point, it's probably around
150 miles."

339
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,502
LAURA: Thank you!

340
00:22:11,502 --> 00:22:16,670
MATT: The next one continues, one after another.
You get a better look, too. The ones at the front

341
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:20,893
that were pretty heavily covered, as opposed to
the ones in the back which are a little taller,

342
00:22:20,893 --> 00:22:24,477
and as you look into the back, there's little
flaps and openings on the inside, you can see

343
00:22:24,477 --> 00:22:26,276
there's families traveling.

344
00:22:26,276 --> 00:22:31,372
MARISHA: Does it look like they have any wares
that they're traveling to trade?

345
00:22:31,372 --> 00:22:35,017
MATT: Make a perception check.

346
00:22:35,017 --> 00:22:44,110
MARISHA: That's a 16, I think. Yeah. 19.

347
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:50,802
MATT: Glancing through, you can see the three
wagons towards the back seem to be more for

348
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:55,391
transport of people. It seems like either these
merchants are bringing their family with them for

349
00:22:55,391 --> 00:23:01,866
long treks, so they're not apart from them for so
long, or their family is just a family of traders

350
00:23:01,866 --> 00:23:07,439
or transport. Looking past them, you can see there
are a lot of supplies behind them, but you're not sure

351
00:23:07,439 --> 00:23:11,436
if they're wares or just their personal goods.

352
00:23:11,436 --> 00:23:14,541
TRAVIS: Molly, feel like making some coin, doing a
little bit of a show?

353
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:16,780
TALIESIN: Hmm.

354
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:21,427
MATT: The fifth cart's now passed. You're moving
on to the sixth cart.

355
00:23:21,427 --> 00:23:24,510
TALIESIN: Do these people look like they're in the
mood to stop?

356
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,270
MARISHA: Yeah, do they look sad?

357
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,358
MATT: Make an insight check.

358
00:23:27,358 --> 00:23:29,026
SAM: Do they look sad.

359
00:23:29,026 --> 00:23:32,073
TALIESIN: What's insight?

360
00:23:32,073 --> 00:23:35,108
LAURA: Plus five.

361
00:23:35,108 --> 00:23:39,539
TALIESIN: Oh, where do you see that? Oh! There it
is. Thank you. 19.

362
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:46,035
MATT: They don't look sad necessarily. They're on
the road, just kind of looking out and keeping

363
00:23:46,035 --> 00:23:52,195
eyes on the vicinity and probably lost in thought.
You do see a pair of children, hard to gauge their

364
00:23:52,195 --> 00:23:59,146
age at this distance, but they're under the age of
ten at least, and they seem to look relatively bored.

365
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:04,139
TALIESIN: I'll balance one of the swords on my
head and flash the cards and see if anybody bites.

366
00:24:04,139 --> 00:24:06,638
LAURA: As you drop them all over the ground.

367
00:24:06,638 --> 00:24:09,133
LIAM: Wakka wakka.

368
00:24:09,133 --> 00:24:18,166
MATT: You watch as the young boy, he has tangled
black hair that poofs out a bit on the sides, he

369
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:23,186
has a deeper brown skin, and he looks up at you
with his bright blue eyes. As soon as you begin

370
00:24:23,186 --> 00:24:28,563
balancing the sword, he smiles a little bit and
jabs his elbow into his sister who's a little bit

371
00:24:28,563 --> 00:24:31,839
older than him, who glances over and points. They
both point towards you. You don't hear anything.

372
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:36,281
They just point and smile as their cart pulls
away, the sixth cart making distance from you.

373
00:24:36,281 --> 00:24:38,502
LAURA: He can tell your fortune!

374
00:24:38,502 --> 00:24:40,509
TALIESIN: They didn't poke the parents.

375
00:24:40,509 --> 00:24:42,332
LAURA: They're stupid.

376
00:24:42,332 --> 00:24:46,165
MATT: The caravan continues without you.

377
00:24:46,165 --> 00:24:48,179
LAURA: Yeah!

378
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:50,692
TALIESIN: Ah, it's very good.

379
00:24:50,692 --> 00:24:51,685
LAURA: Is it?

380
00:24:51,685 --> 00:24:52,422
TALIESIN: Yes.

381
00:24:52,422 --> 00:24:53,367
LAURA: What does it mean?

382
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,150
TALIESIN: It means that you're on a cart.

383
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:57,778
LAURA: It was the chariot.

384
00:24:57,778 --> 00:25:03,807
TRAVIS: Would you normally, you know, hijack a
caravan like that?

385
00:25:03,807 --> 00:25:10,380
SAM: I mean, we have in the past. If we are
confident we can get away with it, we would. We could--

386
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,397
TALIESIN: Can you get away with something like
that?

387
00:25:12,397 --> 00:25:16,923
SAM: There's a lot of people in that caravan
though, it seems like a risky maneuver.

388
00:25:16,923 --> 00:25:18,857
LIAM: That's a pretty big matzo ball there.

389
00:25:18,857 --> 00:25:22,342
TALIESIN: And stealing is wrong. But if you did
it, could you get away with it?

390
00:25:22,342 --> 00:25:25,866
SAM: We could probably get away with it. Why? You
want to follow them and rob their shit?

391
00:25:25,866 --> 00:25:29,392
TRAVIS: Just going off what you said earlier. I
don't want to change your behavior just because

392
00:25:29,392 --> 00:25:31,341
you're with us all of a sudden.

393
00:25:31,341 --> 00:25:34,997
SAM: I mean, sure. Let's go do it.

394
00:25:34,997 --> 00:25:37,040
LAURA: He's just trying to get you in trouble.

395
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,655
SAM: Oh, okay.

396
00:25:38,655 --> 00:25:40,575
TRAVIS: I am not. Merely asking a question.

397
00:25:40,575 --> 00:25:43,692
MARISHA: Would you join in in the stand off?

398
00:25:43,692 --> 00:25:46,180
TRAVIS: Wait, what does that--

399
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:50,000
MARISHA: Would you join the stagecoach robbery?

400
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,377
TRAVIS: If we're pointing them down, reach for the
sky!

401
00:25:56,377 --> 00:26:01,336
TALIESIN: Careful, those fingers are loaded.

402
00:26:01,336 --> 00:26:04,540
LIAM: Yeah, but I would ask. Are you asking
because that is something that you have no

403
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:08,401
experience with or are you wondering maybe is that
something that we could join you in?

404
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:12,641
TRAVIS: Only because I have no experience in it, I
was just curious what it was that you might have

405
00:26:12,641 --> 00:26:14,673
done, you know, previously.

406
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:17,826
LAURA: Did you hijack a cart?

407
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:25,890
SAM: No, we were more small-time thieves. We
wouldn't typically hijack moving caravans. Usually

408
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:29,724
we'd wait until they parked somewhere and then
just go sneak on and steal something out of the back.

409
00:26:29,724 --> 00:26:32,906
LIAM: Mostly whatever we can walk away with.

410
00:26:32,906 --> 00:26:39,433
MARISHA: The things with moving carts of that big
a family is they tend to prep. You don't know what

411
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:41,343
kind of people or weapons they have with them.

412
00:26:41,343 --> 00:26:43,469
LIAM: Always go for a sure thing.

413
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:47,068
MARISHA: You know how we're pretty sure that
everyone on this road's going to kill us? Yeah,

414
00:26:47,068 --> 00:26:48,700
everyone else thinks that, too.

415
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,830
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

416
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:55,092
SAM: But if you need me to teach you how to steal,
you can tag along sometime.

417
00:26:55,092 --> 00:26:57,815
TRAVIS: I might take you up on that, yeah.

418
00:26:57,815 --> 00:26:59,287
SAM: All right.

419
00:26:59,287 --> 00:27:01,133
TALIESIN: Interesting.

420
00:27:01,133 --> 00:27:06,244
MATT: Continuing on your path, I want to ask which
two of you are taking point in keeping an eye on

421
00:27:06,244 --> 00:27:08,794
the road and the landscape around you as you
progress?

422
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,366
TRAVIS: (fake cough) Beau.

423
00:27:10,366 --> 00:27:11,528
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll take watch.

424
00:27:11,528 --> 00:27:12,483
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry.

425
00:27:12,483 --> 00:27:13,841
MATT: Okay. Beau and who else?

426
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:15,018
TRAVIS: So generous of you.

427
00:27:15,018 --> 00:27:16,067
LAURA: You want to do it?

428
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:20,465
TALIESIN: I was going to say, yeah. I'll take a
round. I'm used to keeping an eye out on the road.

429
00:27:20,465 --> 00:27:24,590
MATT: So the two of you are taking point up until
you guys decide to change it when it comes to

430
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,288
travel along the road.

431
00:27:26,288 --> 00:27:27,866
MARISHA: It's just general perception?

432
00:27:27,866 --> 00:27:33,742
MATT: Yes. I would like you both, currently about
an hour's journey past that intersection with the

433
00:27:33,742 --> 00:27:35,477
other caravan, to make a perception check.

434
00:27:35,477 --> 00:27:39,905
LAURA: Ooh! I bet someone's going to try to hijack
our shit on the road just like we were talking

435
00:27:39,905 --> 00:27:41,005
about then.

436
00:27:41,005 --> 00:27:42,957
MARISHA: Not too bad. 18.

437
00:27:42,957 --> 00:27:44,488
TRAVIS: Yeah! Smash.

438
00:27:44,488 --> 00:27:51,101
MATT: 18 and eight. Actually, both of you don't
really notice anything.

439
00:27:51,101 --> 00:27:54,492
MARISHA: Oh. Take that back. Take it back.

440
00:27:54,492 --> 00:27:59,103
MATT: Both of you keeping an eye out, the hills
continue to roll. You see patches of trees and

441
00:27:59,103 --> 00:28:05,518
small wooded areas. Grass field is tall but it's
beautiful and the light breeze that blows through,

442
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:13,341
you can see the waves of wind as they come across.
You can hear the faint sound of it moving the

443
00:28:13,341 --> 00:28:14,736
fields across.

444
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:18,367
MARISHA: Is there a tree that looks climbable that
I could get a vantage point?

445
00:28:18,367 --> 00:28:23,512
MATT: There is. It's maybe about 600 feet off the
road, but you can try and head over there if you

446
00:28:23,512 --> 00:28:25,040
want to.

447
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,442
TRAVIS: Plus we've been traveling for what? About
hour and a half, two hours now?

448
00:28:28,442 --> 00:28:30,500
MATT: I'd say total right now, you've been
probably on the road for about four hours.

449
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,585
MARISHA: Oh.

450
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:34,091
TRAVIS: We should probably rest the <i>horse</i> for
just a bit.

451
00:28:34,091 --> 00:28:37,231
(laughter)

452
00:28:37,231 --> 00:28:41,575
MARISHA: Sure. Anyone want to take a quick pee
break?

453
00:28:41,575 --> 00:28:42,811
LAURA: Yes.

454
00:28:42,811 --> 00:28:43,730
SAM: Yes, please.

455
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,346
MARISHA: All right. Let's go over to the bushes.

456
00:28:45,346 --> 00:28:48,148
MATT: All right. So you guys leave the cart on the
road or do you take it off to the side?

457
00:28:48,148 --> 00:28:50,103
SAM: Should leave a guard with the--

458
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,695
LAURA: We should lead it off the road.

459
00:28:51,695 --> 00:28:54,050
MARISHA: Can we take it with us fairly easily?

460
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:58,753
MATT: I mean, you can. The progress will slow a
bit because you're now taking it through the hills

461
00:28:58,753 --> 00:29:00,920
and the field and having to push the cart through
the grass.

462
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,877
LIAM: No, we should take it off the road.

463
00:29:02,877 --> 00:29:04,871
LAURA: Just off the road a little bit.

464
00:29:04,871 --> 00:29:07,736
MARISHA: Just off the road but we don't have to go
all the way to the tree, I can--

465
00:29:07,736 --> 00:29:09,821
TALIESIN: I'll sit with the cart for the first
roll.

466
00:29:09,821 --> 00:29:11,178
TRAVIS: I'll stay with you.

467
00:29:11,178 --> 00:29:12,940
LIAM: Where are you going to do?

468
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:16,004
MARISHA: I'm just going to go check out this tree
over here. See if I can get a little better

469
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,444
vantage.

470
00:29:17,444 --> 00:29:23,427
LIAM: Okay. I have a bird that can go probably
higher than the tree, if you want.

471
00:29:23,427 --> 00:29:25,245
MARISHA: Yeah, kind of forgot about that.

472
00:29:25,245 --> 00:29:27,465
LIAM: Would you like me to do that?

473
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:29,518
LAURA: Maybe she likes climbing trees.

474
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:32,524
LIAM: Or you could. I don't want to rob you of the
joy of climbing a good tree.

475
00:29:32,524 --> 00:29:35,624
TRAVIS: Or falling out of it, which we would
really enjoy.

476
00:29:35,624 --> 00:29:37,423
TALIESIN: That would be actually extremely--

477
00:29:37,423 --> 00:29:42,012
MARISHA: Both are very pleasant, but I do not
necessarily need that to feel fulfilled.

478
00:29:42,012 --> 00:29:49,433
LIAM: Okay. Well, I will sit in the field then and
give him a little chuck under the chin and-- oh,

479
00:29:49,433 --> 00:29:52,907
wait. Before I go away, am I looking for anything
specific?

480
00:29:52,907 --> 00:29:54,871
MARISHA: Just people coming.

481
00:29:54,871 --> 00:29:56,102
LIAM: People coming.

482
00:29:56,102 --> 00:30:01,214
MATT: As the rest of you take a moment to step off
to the side of the road, pull out some of your

483
00:30:01,214 --> 00:30:03,981
travel supplies to feed the horse, give it a
rest.

484
00:30:03,981 --> 00:30:05,186
LAURA: Pick some flowers.

485
00:30:05,186 --> 00:30:08,151
MATT: Pick some flowers, which you can find.
They're wildflowers. They're bright white,

486
00:30:08,151 --> 00:30:15,317
scattered and simple, but they're beautiful in their own
right. You all take a bit to relieve yourselves a

487
00:30:15,317 --> 00:30:19,342
little ways off the road. You make your way
towards the nearest tree and it's a cluster of

488
00:30:19,342 --> 00:30:23,329
about five or six that are nearby, this pocket
where it seems like some seeds long ago got

489
00:30:23,329 --> 00:30:29,907
dropped by a bird, probably, over the sky, and
then proceeded to grow and sprout. The lowest

490
00:30:29,907 --> 00:30:34,346
branch is about ten feet up, so you're going to
have to take a quick leap and try and climb some

491
00:30:34,346 --> 00:30:35,299
of it.

492
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:36,487
MARISHA: I wanted to wait for Caleb.

493
00:30:36,487 --> 00:30:39,297
MATT: Oh, that's right, you're waiting there.
Never mind. You see that tree and you go, "I'll

494
00:30:39,297 --> 00:30:41,216
"get to that later."

495
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:45,792
MARISHA: It's a damn good tree. I do miss climbing
trees.

496
00:30:45,792 --> 00:30:49,169
LAURA: Do you need me to lift you up to the
branch?

497
00:30:49,169 --> 00:30:50,757
MATT: Your eyes cloud over.

498
00:30:50,757 --> 00:30:55,295
LIAM: They do. As the bird is flying, just for a
second, I say: You know, ordinarily-- I can't hear

499
00:30:55,295 --> 00:31:00,738
you, but he's a cat almost all the time, so this
is a rarity. You'll be able to climb many trees,

500
00:31:00,738 --> 00:31:04,561
many other times, but we should take advantage of
him. Well, okay.

501
00:31:04,561 --> 00:31:08,753
LAURA: None of us were nearby when he was saying
all of that.

502
00:31:08,753 --> 00:31:11,671
MATT: No, you guys were quite a ways off. No one
was in earshot.

503
00:31:11,671 --> 00:31:13,824
TRAVIS: We were shitting in the bushes.

504
00:31:13,824 --> 00:31:17,984
MATT: A ladybug lands on his nose and goes in his
nostril, but he can't feel it.

505
00:31:17,984 --> 00:31:19,865
LIAM: Feel it?! I can feel stuff!

506
00:31:19,865 --> 00:31:22,336
MATT: Maybe not this. You're too focused.

507
00:31:22,336 --> 00:31:26,654
LIAM: We worked out that he could-- okay, great.
There's bugs in my nose.

508
00:31:26,654 --> 00:31:28,257
MATT: It tickles a little bit.

509
00:31:28,257 --> 00:31:30,640
LIAM: Shove it all in, everybody!

510
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,288
MATT: To be fair, your face itches in general from
the sheer amount of filth that's on it. It's hard

511
00:31:34,288 --> 00:31:36,459
to really differentiate.

512
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:41,602
LIAM: In the middle of the field you hear: Ooh,
look at that! What do I see?

513
00:31:41,602 --> 00:31:44,531
MATT: Make a perception check for your birdie.

514
00:31:44,531 --> 00:31:46,502
LIAM: That's a nine.

515
00:31:46,502 --> 00:31:52,443
MATT: Glancing over and doing a wide pass around
as everyone begins to gather their things and head

516
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:59,451
towards the cart, the road's pretty open. At this
point, the previous caravan is invisible from that

517
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:03,466
height, the hills close that distance. You don't
see anything coming your way. It seems pretty open

518
00:32:03,466 --> 00:32:04,321
and safe.

519
00:32:04,321 --> 00:32:07,978
LIAM: Okay. I keep flying for a little bit
longer.

520
00:32:07,978 --> 00:32:09,257
MATT: Okay.

521
00:32:09,257 --> 00:32:11,814
LAURA: I lift Beau up to the branch just because.

522
00:32:11,814 --> 00:32:16,898
MARISHA: Okay. Feels like childhood. Do you want
up here?

523
00:32:16,898 --> 00:32:18,390
LAURA: Yeah, I'll jump!

524
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:19,707
MARISHA: All right, I lift her up.

525
00:32:19,707 --> 00:32:21,474
LAURA: We sit up in the branches.

526
00:32:21,474 --> 00:32:23,370
MATT: Okay, cool. It's a nice view.

527
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:27,282
(laughter)

528
00:32:27,282 --> 00:32:29,817
TRAVIS: It's impossible to believe him.

529
00:32:29,817 --> 00:32:33,087
MARISHA: Is there anything carved in the
branches, in the tree trunk?

530
00:32:33,087 --> 00:32:35,879
MATT: Make an investigation check.

531
00:32:35,879 --> 00:32:37,573
LIAM: The treant eats you.

532
00:32:37,573 --> 00:32:39,328
MATT: Shh, don't spoil it!

533
00:32:39,328 --> 00:32:41,458
MARISHA: 18.

534
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:51,265
MATT: No carvings of names or letters, but you do
see a few knots in the tree that have currently

535
00:32:51,265 --> 00:32:54,349
been carved out and made a home to a number of
woodland creatures.

536
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:58,369
LAURA: I've never climbed a tree before.

537
00:32:58,369 --> 00:32:59,392
MARISHA: Really?

538
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:01,216
LAURA: Yeah. This is really pretty.

539
00:33:01,216 --> 00:33:06,073
MARISHA: What do you think lives in that hole?

540
00:33:06,073 --> 00:33:09,129
LAURA: Probably very small unicorns.

541
00:33:09,129 --> 00:33:11,577
MARISHA: Have you ever seen an unicorn?

542
00:33:11,577 --> 00:33:17,579
LAURA: Yes, I've seen many. The little ones can be
as small as hamsters.

543
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:19,908
MARISHA: Pocket unicorns?

544
00:33:19,908 --> 00:33:21,104
LAURA: Yeah.

545
00:33:21,104 --> 00:33:23,631
MARISHA: Where do you find such things?

546
00:33:23,631 --> 00:33:25,878
LAURA: All over. You just have to know where to look.

547
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:29,248
SAM: And believe.

548
00:33:29,248 --> 00:33:31,724
TALIESIN: She's starting to believe.

549
00:33:31,724 --> 00:33:34,423
MARISHA: What is it like being in your head?

550
00:33:34,423 --> 00:33:38,834
LAURA: It's pretty great!

551
00:33:38,834 --> 00:33:45,784
MATT: Eventually, you all gather yourselves again
back at the wagon, cart it back onto the road, and

552
00:33:45,784 --> 00:33:54,774
head northward. Another few hours pass before the
sun begins to set. As the sky grows darker, the

553
00:33:54,774 --> 00:34:01,360
clouds from the north-northeast begin to filter in
with a colder wind. You get the sense that the

554
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,833
warm day that you had is coming to a close and who
knows how long the current cold weather will keep.

555
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:13,528
The light begins to fade, darker and darker, until
you get the sense that you have about 30 minutes

556
00:34:13,528 --> 00:34:15,523
before this field goes pitch black.

557
00:34:15,523 --> 00:34:17,278
LIAM: How cold is it out?

558
00:34:17,278 --> 00:34:19,213
MATT: You can see your breath.

559
00:34:19,213 --> 00:34:21,012
LAURA: Oh, that's pretty cold.

560
00:34:21,012 --> 00:34:26,614
MATT: Not super thick, but when you exhale you see
a bit of the breath before you.

561
00:34:26,614 --> 00:34:29,694
TRAVIS: Should we pull off on the side of the road
and get a campfire going?

562
00:34:29,694 --> 00:34:32,562
TALIESIN: I'd say let's get a bit off the road, if
possible.

563
00:34:32,562 --> 00:34:38,614
MARISHA: Does it look like there's any trees or
any base of mountains or any place that would be a

564
00:34:38,614 --> 00:34:40,594
good sheltered campsite?

565
00:34:40,594 --> 00:34:45,304
MATT: There are no mountains anywhere in the
vicinity. You're in the center of the rolling

566
00:34:45,304 --> 00:34:52,663
hills. There is a cluster of trees you could go to
that's about 300 feet or so off the road. It's

567
00:34:52,663 --> 00:34:58,021
three trees, so it's not a lot of cover, but
unfortunately you're in the middle of a valley.

568
00:34:58,021 --> 00:34:59,530
TALIESIN: It'll do.

569
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:02,226
LAURA: Can we get the horse over to them?

570
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:08,594
MATT: It takes you a little bit. You spend about
45 minutes in pitch dark keeping an eye in that

571
00:35:08,594 --> 00:35:13,276
direction before you come upon the tree. You can
faintly see the outline of the tree against the

572
00:35:13,276 --> 00:35:20,570
faint bit of light making it through the cloud cover.
You guys stop there, get the horse a little bit of

573
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:23,649
water and feed, and the site's yours.

574
00:35:23,649 --> 00:35:25,388
TALIESIN: Set a tent. Start a fire.

575
00:35:25,388 --> 00:35:28,054
LAURA: This is why we should've taken one of the
circus tents.

576
00:35:28,054 --> 00:35:32,824
TALIESIN: They take an awful lot of time to put
up. You do know this. There's a process.

577
00:35:32,824 --> 00:35:34,782
LAURA: Yeah, but think about how cool it would be
to camp in one.

578
00:35:34,782 --> 00:35:40,031
TALIESIN: Oh, it would be amazing. I've done it.
It's great, but this is nice, too.

579
00:35:40,031 --> 00:35:44,362
TRAVIS: Shall we collect some wood and start a
fire?

580
00:35:44,362 --> 00:35:46,996
SAM: Sounds good.

581
00:35:46,996 --> 00:35:48,948
MATT: Who's starting the fire?

582
00:35:48,948 --> 00:35:53,261
TRAVIS: Anybody want to come with me to find some
kindling?

583
00:35:53,261 --> 00:35:56,654
MARISHA: I have an adventurer's kit. Does that
have a tinder in it?

584
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:59,453
MATT: You can do that.

585
00:35:59,453 --> 00:36:00,586
TRAVIS: Shall we?

586
00:36:00,586 --> 00:36:01,671
MARISHA: Sure.

587
00:36:01,671 --> 00:36:03,355
TRAVIS: All right. Go look for some dead-ish
branches.

588
00:36:03,355 --> 00:36:07,266
MARISHA: I'm a little-- you be my eyes. It's super
dark.

589
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:08,982
SAM: Maybe you shouldn't go.

590
00:36:08,982 --> 00:36:18,035
MARISHA: You know what, I'll start digging a
little pit.

591
00:36:18,035 --> 00:36:24,690
LIAM: Now, hold on. I pull a rag out, and I (poof)
one of the Dancing Lights, and make that hooded

592
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,868
lantern again so that you can see.

593
00:36:26,868 --> 00:36:32,611
MATT: With that light, it's easy enough to find
some small kindling. There's not a whole lot in

594
00:36:32,611 --> 00:36:38,358
the vicinity, mainly being that it's an open
field. But you find a few pieces of fallen tree

595
00:36:38,358 --> 00:36:42,440
and general dead plant life in the vicinity that
can get <i>something</i> going.

596
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,904
TALIESIN: We can chop it up.

597
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:49,254
MATT: Eventually you get a fire going. It's a
little beacon of light here in the darkness,

598
00:36:49,254 --> 00:36:56,094
orange-ish flickering against the interior
of the three trees as you guys are situated there.

599
00:36:56,094 --> 00:37:03,202
You figure you've made it a little under halfway
to Alfield, which is the small city on the way to

600
00:37:03,202 --> 00:37:09,284
Zadash. It'll take you a little over a day's
travel, or if you push it ahead you could probably

601
00:37:09,284 --> 00:37:17,739
make it in a day, but you can run the risk of
getting tired. But for resting this evening, who

602
00:37:17,739 --> 00:37:20,003
wants to take watch?

603
00:37:20,003 --> 00:37:22,034
TRAVIS: Nobody. We're all going to sleep.

604
00:37:22,034 --> 00:37:25,671
LIAM: While they decide that, I'm going to pull
out my silver thread and I'm going to start

605
00:37:25,671 --> 00:37:30,967
winding a 20-foot circle around the fire.

606
00:37:30,967 --> 00:37:32,483
MARISHA: Oh, nice.

607
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:36,384
LAURA: I get my little bouquet of wildflowers and
I give it to Nott.

608
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:39,559
SAM: Oh, that's very nice of you.

609
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:41,680
LAURA: Well, you said all girls like flowers.

610
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:47,315
SAM: We do. That's very nice of you, thank you.
What did I do to deserve this?

611
00:37:47,315 --> 00:37:51,612
LAURA: I don't know, you are my friend.

612
00:37:51,612 --> 00:37:58,065
TALIESIN: A single tear pours down a porcelain
cheek.

613
00:37:58,065 --> 00:38:01,332
LAURA: I'll take first watch.

614
00:38:01,332 --> 00:38:02,707
MATT: Okay.

615
00:38:02,707 --> 00:38:08,174
LIAM: Everybody hears a little (ting) as I hit a
little bell that I have that's part of it.

616
00:38:08,174 --> 00:38:10,418
And that's it.

617
00:38:10,418 --> 00:38:15,029
SAM: I'll sit up with you, Jester, and take first
watch, 1B.

618
00:38:15,029 --> 00:38:16,852
LAURA: I like it.

619
00:38:16,852 --> 00:38:23,426
MATT: All right. We'll say for the purposes of
expediency on this, I'll take three perception

620
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:29,059
rolls from three different people that are keeping
watch throughout the evening. So with the setup of

621
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:31,837
your spell, you go to rest. Jester, you first.

622
00:38:31,837 --> 00:38:37,309
LAURA: Oh, god damn it!

623
00:38:37,309 --> 00:38:38,490
SAM: No, it's pretty good.

624
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,332
LAURA: Yeah, one. So pretty good.

625
00:38:40,332 --> 00:38:43,605
MATT: All right, natural one. About ten minutes--

626
00:38:43,605 --> 00:38:44,889
LAURA: Sorry, guys.

627
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:49,760
MATT: About ten minutes into your watch, the
inspiration hits for you to start drawing

628
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,696
interesting faces and weird trees. You start
sketching--

629
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:56,435
LAURA: Little tiny hamster unicorns!

630
00:38:56,435 --> 00:39:02,937
MATT: There you go. As you begin to sketch, you
are not paying attention at all to the area around you.

631
00:39:02,937 --> 00:39:08,854
LAURA: It's really cute! All wrapped up in a
little swaddling blanket!

632
00:39:08,854 --> 00:39:12,571
MARISHA: Little hamster tails! Oh man!

633
00:39:12,571 --> 00:39:19,994
MATT: Giant miniatures space unicorns. However,
even though you rolled really poorly, your watch

634
00:39:19,994 --> 00:39:23,736
goes through unabated. Second watch, who's taking
that?

635
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,872
LAURA: I'm so tired! (snores)

636
00:39:25,872 --> 00:39:27,298
LIAM: I will stay up for a little bit, yeah.

637
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,775
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll a perception
check, please.

638
00:39:29,775 --> 00:39:34,190
LAURA, MARISHA, and TRAVIS: (chanting) Caleb!

639
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:36,466
LIAM: Oh, that's pretty good. That's a 19.

640
00:39:36,466 --> 00:39:44,843
MATT: Okay. Keeping an eye out, you see a little
ways off-- it's hard to make out any shapes

641
00:39:44,843 --> 00:39:50,948
because of your human eyes and, with the firelight
that's near you, your eyes can't adjust to the

642
00:39:50,948 --> 00:39:55,175
darkness as well, but there are bits and pieces
where the clouds do break, the moonlight comes

643
00:39:55,175 --> 00:40:02,378
down and you can see a distant shape that's moving
through the field maybe about 400 feet off. You

644
00:40:02,378 --> 00:40:07,802
can see it pushing through the height of the
grass, moving slowly.

645
00:40:07,802 --> 00:40:09,396
LIAM: Am I the only one awake at this moment?

646
00:40:09,396 --> 00:40:10,516
MATT: Yep.

647
00:40:10,516 --> 00:40:14,248
LIAM: I slowly jiggle Nott awake. (whispers) Get
up.

648
00:40:14,248 --> 00:40:17,576
SAM: It was violin class! What?

649
00:40:17,576 --> 00:40:19,898
LIAM: I put a hand over her mouth.

650
00:40:19,898 --> 00:40:21,513
SAM: What's going on?

651
00:40:21,513 --> 00:40:27,432
LIAM: There is a thing out around our fire a ways
off.

652
00:40:27,432 --> 00:40:29,983
SAM: Why did we leave you on watch? You can't see
in the dark!

653
00:40:29,983 --> 00:40:33,095
LIAM: No, I saw the shape. It's not dark, there's
a fire here.

654
00:40:33,095 --> 00:40:45,027
SAM: Okay, let me sneak around and look. Right? We
don't want to wake everyone because--

655
00:40:45,027 --> 00:40:47,973
LIAM: Because we want them to die? I think we
should probably wake everyone.

656
00:40:47,973 --> 00:40:52,135
SAM: What if it's nothing? Then they'll be upset
with us. There's nothing more dangerous than--

657
00:40:52,135 --> 00:40:53,401
LIAM: I shake Beau awake.

658
00:40:53,401 --> 00:40:55,107
SAM: No, she's the most irritable!

659
00:40:55,107 --> 00:40:56,980
MARISHA: I'm what?

660
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,093
SAM: Sorry.

661
00:40:58,093 --> 00:40:59,529
MARISHA: Did you say I'm fucking irritable?

662
00:40:59,529 --> 00:41:06,611
LIAM: She said "most beautiful." There's a thing
out there in the field. Something is moving.

663
00:41:06,611 --> 00:41:08,524
LAURA: She can't see! She's human, too!

664
00:41:08,524 --> 00:41:11,631
(laughter)

665
00:41:11,631 --> 00:41:13,380
SAM: I'm going to go look! I can see in the dark.

666
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,793
LIAM: No, wait here!

667
00:41:14,793 --> 00:41:18,069
SAM: I'm going to dart off in a flanking maneuver.

668
00:41:18,069 --> 00:41:20,182
MATT: Make a stealth check.

669
00:41:20,182 --> 00:41:21,703
SAM: 18 plus stuff.

670
00:41:21,703 --> 00:41:25,633
LIAM: As soon as I see her do that, I start
swatting Fjord on the back to wake him up.

671
00:41:25,633 --> 00:41:26,957
SAM: 26.

672
00:41:26,957 --> 00:41:28,236
MARISHA: What do I see?

673
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:32,800
MATT: You vaguely see the shape moving, but it's
hard to see, and only because of the moonlight.

674
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:44,378
Nott, as you stealth up and quickly move through
the grass, eventually you hear this (soft grunting).

675
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:50,265
You glance up and see there is not one,
but three large buffalo-type creatures that are

676
00:41:50,265 --> 00:41:51,995
lumbering through the fields.

677
00:41:51,995 --> 00:41:53,740
SAM: Buffalo-type creatures, or buffalo?

678
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:57,938
MATT: You're not sure. You're not close enough to
see. You see they're bipedal, they're thick and

679
00:41:57,938 --> 00:42:01,726
muscular, and they have these large horns that
curl off to the side and out.

680
00:42:01,726 --> 00:42:05,088
TRAVIS: Bipedal?

681
00:42:05,088 --> 00:42:07,465
MATT: Sorry, quadruped, not bipedal.

682
00:42:07,465 --> 00:42:09,288
SAM: How far am I from the camp?

683
00:42:09,288 --> 00:42:18,079
MATT: You're about, maybe, 80 to 100 feet from it.

684
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:26,999
SAM: Cool. I'm going to pull out a piece of copper
wire and, remembering the motions that Caleb

685
00:42:26,999 --> 00:42:32,570
taught me, I'm going to twirl it around in my hand
and hold it up to my mouth and whisper a Message

686
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:34,353
just to Caleb.

687
00:42:34,353 --> 00:42:37,560
TRAVIS: Oh shit, what?!

688
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:44,454
SAM: I'm going to say: it's three buffalo, or
buffalo-type objects. Creatures. What do you want

689
00:42:44,454 --> 00:42:46,623
me to do? (fwoosh)

690
00:42:46,623 --> 00:42:56,467
LIAM: I'm so proud! I don't know that spell, so I
cannot talk back.

691
00:42:56,467 --> 00:42:59,336
SAM: Yes, you can!

692
00:42:59,336 --> 00:43:11,657
LIAM: What? Who said that? If you can can hear
me-- I don't think you can-- come back with the group.

693
00:43:11,657 --> 00:43:13,601
SAM: All right.

694
00:43:13,601 --> 00:43:15,176
LAURA: Can you hear him?

695
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:16,328
LIAM: Is that how Message works?

696
00:43:16,328 --> 00:43:17,436
SAM: Yes, I can hear you.

697
00:43:17,436 --> 00:43:18,719
LAURA: That is awesome!

698
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:23,138
MATT: The whispers continue back and forth.

699
00:43:23,138 --> 00:43:29,407
SAM: It's just one back and forth. I can talk to
him, he can reply once. That's it.

700
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,697
MATT: For one round.

701
00:43:30,697 --> 00:43:31,815
LIAM: For one round, so six seconds.

702
00:43:31,815 --> 00:43:33,150
LAURA: Sick.

703
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:35,333
MATT: It's a cantrip.

704
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:38,528
LAURA: Oh my gosh, I love it.

705
00:43:38,528 --> 00:43:40,522
LIAM: Oh, if it's a cantrip, you can do it over
and over again.

706
00:43:40,522 --> 00:43:42,163
LAURA: It's a cantrip?

707
00:43:42,163 --> 00:43:47,736
SAM: Is it? Oh, it is! Ooh, this is exciting! I've
never had magic before.

708
00:43:47,736 --> 00:43:50,149
LIAM: It's two soup cans with a string.

709
00:43:50,149 --> 00:43:51,690
MATT: Essentially.

710
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:53,612
LAURA: How far does it go?

711
00:43:53,612 --> 00:43:54,787
SAM: You don't know!

712
00:43:54,787 --> 00:43:56,333
TRAVIS: Yeah, there you go.

713
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:57,705
SAM: You're drawing hamsters.

714
00:43:57,705 --> 00:44:00,019
LAURA: Oh, the cutest unicorn hamsters.

715
00:44:00,019 --> 00:44:01,576
MATT: So Nott, what are you doing?

716
00:44:01,576 --> 00:44:07,086
SAM: He said to come back, so I'm coming back. On
the way back, I'm going to see if they're eating

717
00:44:07,086 --> 00:44:08,816
or sleeping. What are they doing?

718
00:44:08,816 --> 00:44:12,616
MATT: They're just moving. As you head back to the
camp, you can see they pass and continue heading

719
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:17,577
in the southwestern direction in the field, not
taking notice of your fire or the encampment.

720
00:44:17,577 --> 00:44:20,803
SAM: They could be good for meat. We could go kill
them and eat them for meat.

721
00:44:20,803 --> 00:44:22,040
LIAM: Is she back?

722
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,121
MATT: Yes.

723
00:44:23,121 --> 00:44:27,354
LIAM: I scoop her up. Look at you! You cast a
spell, you spoke to me!

724
00:44:27,354 --> 00:44:32,052
SAM: You said to do the hand movements and the
whispery thing. And I did it and it worked!

725
00:44:32,052 --> 00:44:33,597
LIAM: It's as simple as that, isn't it?

726
00:44:33,597 --> 00:44:34,577
SAM: Yes!

727
00:44:34,577 --> 00:44:38,160
LIAM: Oh, I'm so proud of you! We need to calm
down and go back to bed.

728
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,017
SAM: Oh, but we could've eaten those buffalo-type
creatures.

729
00:44:42,017 --> 00:44:44,688
TRAVIS: Hey, what the fuck did you wake us up for,
anyway?

730
00:44:44,688 --> 00:44:47,771
LIAM: (laughs nervously) Got you.

731
00:44:47,771 --> 00:44:49,569
TRAVIS: That's a joke?

732
00:44:49,569 --> 00:44:53,585
LIAM: No. I thought we were all going to die, but
it was just-- what was it?

733
00:44:53,585 --> 00:44:59,202
SAM: Three large beasts of burden. Wait, we could
use them to pull the cart!

734
00:44:59,202 --> 00:45:03,823
TRAVIS: Yeah! Where are they?

735
00:45:03,823 --> 00:45:06,347
SAM: They went that way! In the dark!

736
00:45:06,347 --> 00:45:12,149
MARISHA: You sure they were just cows? Or donkeys?
Or buffalo-type things?

737
00:45:12,149 --> 00:45:16,840
SAM: I don't know! I don't know what they were,
but they looked big and able to pull the cart.

738
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,326
TRAVIS: Let's go look at one.

739
00:45:18,326 --> 00:45:21,260
SAM: You want to go cow-tipping, don't you?

740
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:27,457
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah! Take me cow-tipping, son! Woo!

741
00:45:27,457 --> 00:45:31,548
LIAM: Echoes in the field. (echoing sounds)

742
00:45:31,548 --> 00:45:33,932
SAM: What happened?

743
00:45:33,932 --> 00:45:35,799
TRAVIS: I don't know. Back in college.

744
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:39,954
SAM: Are we going to go after them or are we going
to go back to sleep?

745
00:45:39,954 --> 00:45:43,716
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go look at one.

746
00:45:43,716 --> 00:45:46,913
LIAM: Well, shit. I guess we're going to look
at a buffalo.

747
00:45:46,913 --> 00:45:48,255
SAM: Let's go!

748
00:45:48,255 --> 00:45:51,075
LAURA and TALIESIN: I'm still sleeping.

749
00:45:51,075 --> 00:45:56,835
MATT: While Molly and Jester continue to enjoy
their continued long rest, you all interrupt it to

750
00:45:56,835 --> 00:46:02,642
get up, and head in the direction of these
creatures. I would like you all to make a stealth

751
00:46:02,642 --> 00:46:04,317
check, please.

752
00:46:04,317 --> 00:46:08,677
SAM: 12.

753
00:46:08,677 --> 00:46:11,120
TRAVIS and MARISHA: 11.

754
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,903
LIAM: 16.

755
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:23,259
MATT: All right. The four of you, shoulder to
shoulder, keeping low, making your way through the

756
00:46:23,259 --> 00:46:31,480
field, stepping ever so carefully. And there's
this (croaking) as one of you accidentally goes

757
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:38,102
completely foot down on to some sort of field frog
that had been there. As the croak hits, you watch

758
00:46:38,102 --> 00:46:45,041
as one of the creatures (startled grunting), and
they all start running away, spooked by the sound.

759
00:46:45,041 --> 00:46:46,459
TRAVIS: Shit.

760
00:46:46,459 --> 00:46:49,268
MARISHA: Can we tell what they are? Now that we're
closer?

761
00:46:49,268 --> 00:46:51,518
MATT: Make a perception check, if you want to.

762
00:46:51,518 --> 00:46:53,230
TRAVIS: I'd like to, with my darkvision.

763
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:55,867
MATT: At disadvantage on you, unfortunately, at
this distance.

764
00:46:55,867 --> 00:46:57,560
TALIESIN: Welcome to human.

765
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:01,488
MARISHA: Six.

766
00:47:01,488 --> 00:47:03,676
MATT: They look like buffalo-like creatures.

767
00:47:03,676 --> 00:47:05,269
TRAVIS: 13?

768
00:47:05,269 --> 00:47:07,433
MATT: They look like buffalo.

769
00:47:07,433 --> 00:47:10,533
SAM: You'll never know what they were.

770
00:47:10,533 --> 00:47:12,193
TRAVIS: Well, that was worth a look.

771
00:47:12,193 --> 00:47:17,137
MATT: You aren't too familiar with a lot of the
indigenous animals that live or have been brought

772
00:47:17,137 --> 00:47:20,568
to this region if they haven't been near the port
towns that you grew up in. You haven't seen these

773
00:47:20,568 --> 00:47:24,829
types of creatures before, but you vaguely know
they're in the ballpark of what a buffalo, you

774
00:47:24,829 --> 00:47:26,177
imagine, looks like.

775
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:28,627
TRAVIS: It's vaguely what I imagine a buffalo
would look like.

776
00:47:28,627 --> 00:47:31,779
MARISHA: Yeah.

777
00:47:31,779 --> 00:47:33,290
SAM: Sorry.

778
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:35,535
MARISHA: That was fun, let's go.

779
00:47:35,535 --> 00:47:37,034
TRAVIS: Back to sleep.

780
00:47:37,034 --> 00:47:40,775
LIAM: Silently ruffle Nott's hair on the way back
to camp.

781
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:42,248
SAM: Stop it.

782
00:47:42,248 --> 00:47:44,898
LAURA: (singing) Who's got the third watch?

783
00:47:44,898 --> 00:47:46,139
TALIESIN: I'll take it.

784
00:47:46,139 --> 00:47:47,495
LIAM: Turd watch.

785
00:47:47,495 --> 00:47:49,054
MATT: All right. Molly has the third watch.

786
00:47:49,054 --> 00:47:50,391
TALIESIN: Turd watch.

787
00:47:50,391 --> 00:47:51,783
MATT: Perception check, please.

788
00:47:51,783 --> 00:47:52,882
LAURA: Oh no!

789
00:47:52,882 --> 00:47:54,009
TALIESIN: Six.

790
00:47:54,009 --> 00:48:01,210
MATT: Okay. As you keep an eye out, everyone else
sleeps throughout the evening. Eventually, you nod

791
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:06,823
off, and fall asleep with the rest of them. I
would like to ask all of you to leave the table

792
00:48:06,823 --> 00:48:10,308
for a moment, except for Fjord.

793
00:48:10,308 --> 00:48:12,215
TRAVIS: For me?!

794
00:48:12,215 --> 00:48:13,212
MATT: Yeah.

795
00:48:13,212 --> 00:48:14,792
MARISHA: It's your turn now!

796
00:48:14,792 --> 00:48:20,070
TRAVIS: Why? (shouting) Why didn't you roll a
higher perception?

797
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:24,136
TALIESIN: I literally don't know. That's actually
the problem.

798
00:48:24,136 --> 00:48:28,591
MARISHA: Just don't get a lich phylactery
installed in you again.

799
00:48:28,591 --> 00:48:30,308
TALIESIN: Travis, it's been nice playing with
you.

800
00:48:30,308 --> 00:48:32,145
TRAVIS: Oh god. Oh no!

801
00:48:32,145 --> 00:48:34,273
TALIESIN: I thoroughly enjoyed your accent.

802
00:48:34,273 --> 00:48:39,709
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

803
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:51,649
MATT: Fjord, as darkness takes your mind,
dreamless like most, you await the emptiness of

804
00:48:51,649 --> 00:49:02,358
sleep to carry you to the day. Your sense of body
fades, but your mind and the dark linger. Minutes,

805
00:49:02,358 --> 00:49:12,806
hours, days. Time loses real sense and meaning,
but you're conscious for it and that is almost

806
00:49:12,806 --> 00:49:18,727
maddening, in that split second or endless stretch
of experience that you're currently unable to

807
00:49:18,727 --> 00:49:29,407
express. As the time passes, the air grows colder
around you. The faint shimmer of shifting midnight

808
00:49:29,407 --> 00:49:38,260
blue, muted and distant, now showing endless depth
before you, rippling. You begin to flail about,

809
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:43,689
your senses returning with the dropping
temperature, but there is resistance to your limbs

810
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:53,892
as you push in the space around you. You're
sluggish. There's force. It's not air, it's water.

811
00:49:53,892 --> 00:50:01,325
You suddenly feel the burning pain in your lungs
as your breath fights to escape you, but you hold

812
00:50:01,325 --> 00:50:07,006
tight. You seize and swim in desperation, choosing
any direction, but the shimmering blue is

813
00:50:07,006 --> 00:50:17,805
directionless. There is no up, there is no down.
It's just depth. Movement. The universal shadows

814
00:50:17,805 --> 00:50:25,617
dance as one, right to left. With a speed that
pulls you along with the current, you feel

815
00:50:25,617 --> 00:50:31,978
yourself being jostled. As it shifts again to the
left to right, around behind you, you find

816
00:50:31,978 --> 00:50:37,230
yourself toppling, head over end, eventually
coming to rest again. You spiral over and over

817
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:42,522
again, the darkness swallowing you, tightening
around you as this dance, this shape, this endless

818
00:50:42,522 --> 00:50:51,147
coil, this spiral around you. As the current tugs
at you, battering you, you cannot fight any more

819
00:50:51,147 --> 00:50:56,609
as the increased power of the current pulls on
your form. You cough, and the freezing waters rush

820
00:50:56,609 --> 00:51:04,921
into your body, the briny taste of salt water
stinging your insides. Your wincing eyes open with

821
00:51:04,921 --> 00:51:15,349
the pain that clutches the interior of your chest,
only to see a gargantuan mass moving through the

822
00:51:15,349 --> 00:51:24,816
water around you, like a massive noose closing in.
The pain in your chest vanishes. As your breathing

823
00:51:24,898 --> 00:51:34,400
normalizes-- thicker than air, but breathable all
the same-- it feels strange yet weirdly familiar.

824
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:45,997
In that moment, yellow light bursts before you in
the shape of an enormous yellow eye. An

825
00:51:45,997 --> 00:51:52,008
impossibly low tone rumbles through the waters
around you, shaking you to your core, like an

826
00:51:52,008 --> 00:52:04,219
organic war horn the size of a canyon. The eye
narrows as the tone grows stronger. A thought

827
00:52:04,219 --> 00:52:09,357
enters your mind, a jumble of emotions that your
brain attempts to make sense of until a word

828
00:52:09,357 --> 00:52:31,102
congeals into the center of your consciousness:
"Watching." The eye just looks at you, waiting expectantly.

829
00:52:31,102 --> 00:52:36,517
TRAVIS: (English accent) What are you?

830
00:52:36,517 --> 00:52:38,857
MATT: "Watching."

831
00:52:38,857 --> 00:52:43,861
TRAVIS: Watching me?

832
00:52:43,861 --> 00:52:53,279
MATT: The eye opens a bit and leans closer towards
you. "Potential."

833
00:52:53,279 --> 00:53:10,399
TRAVIS: My potential? What are you asking of me?

834
00:53:10,399 --> 00:53:14,461
MATT: "Learn."

835
00:53:14,461 --> 00:53:20,280
TRAVIS: Learn. What would you have me learn?

836
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:33,381
MATT: "Learn. Grow. Provoke. Consume."

837
00:53:33,381 --> 00:53:42,676
TRAVIS: Learn, grow, provoke, consume. I don't
understand.

838
00:53:42,676 --> 00:53:46,394
MATT: "Reward."

839
00:53:46,394 --> 00:53:55,824
TRAVIS: A reward for this? I'm listening.

840
00:53:55,824 --> 00:54:06,988
MATT: "Patience." The eye closes, and the light is
gone. You feel the darkness and the cold

841
00:54:06,988 --> 00:54:11,843
completely suffuse your entire world as the panic
and solitude, the true quiet of your

842
00:54:11,843 --> 00:54:17,755
unconsciousness, begins to take hold. At that
moment, you gasp for breath, and your eyes open,

843
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:22,969
coughing and sputtering in the morning air. If we
could have everybody else come back to the table,

844
00:54:22,969 --> 00:54:26,555
please! Call them back in.

845
00:54:26,555 --> 00:54:38,398
TRAVIS: Fuck. Fuck you! What were those words?!

846
00:54:38,398 --> 00:54:52,753
MATT: Watching, potential, learn, grow, provoke,
consume. We'll go over the rest later. Come on in!

847
00:54:52,753 --> 00:54:54,005
SAM: Are we supposed to come back?

848
00:54:54,005 --> 00:54:55,170
MATT: Yes, you're supposed to come back in.

849
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:56,220
LAURA: We're supposed to come in!

850
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:57,098
MATT: You are.

851
00:54:57,098 --> 00:54:59,336
TRAVIS: Sorry, I found a patch of strawberries.

852
00:54:59,336 --> 00:55:00,711
TALIESIN: Everybody back?

853
00:55:00,711 --> 00:55:01,915
MATT: Everybody back.

854
00:55:01,915 --> 00:55:06,266
LIAM: Are you okay? We're fine? Everything's
good?

855
00:55:06,266 --> 00:55:09,427
TRAVIS: Yeah! We're fine. We're great. Just
doing dandy. Yep.

856
00:55:09,427 --> 00:55:11,177
LIAM: You would tell us if something was wrong?

857
00:55:11,177 --> 00:55:13,274
TRAVIS: Of course.

858
00:55:13,274 --> 00:55:20,023
SAM: That was fast. You really fought five guys in
an alleyway that fast?

859
00:55:20,023 --> 00:55:22,950
TRAVIS: Sometimes it doesn't take that long, you
know what I mean?

860
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:25,224
LAURA: What does he look like? What are we doing?

861
00:55:25,224 --> 00:55:34,958
MATT: As the rest of you have already come to
consciousness in the morning air, begun to situate

862
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:42,165
your belongings and put out the embers of the fire
that lasted-- pardon-- throughout the night. Your

863
00:55:42,165 --> 00:55:51,113
morning belches getting out. Fjord has slept in,
and has been ever so still in his sleep. Suddenly,

864
00:55:51,113 --> 00:55:59,105
without warning, he suddenly shoots up from his
sleep, his eyes wide, and as he opens his mouth,

865
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:02,639
begins coughing and spitting water up.

866
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:06,285
TRAVIS: (coughing)

867
00:56:06,285 --> 00:56:09,741
SAM: Oh no, he's injured!

868
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:15,301
LAURA: Fjord! Have I ever seen this happen to him
before?

869
00:56:15,301 --> 00:56:16,642
MATT: No.

870
00:56:16,642 --> 00:56:18,422
LIAM: Can you speak?

871
00:56:18,422 --> 00:56:21,166
TRAVIS: Yeah. No, I'm fine.

872
00:56:21,166 --> 00:56:23,006
TALIESIN: Yeah, you look it.

873
00:56:23,006 --> 00:56:28,571
LIAM: You just spit a lot of water out and you
were sleeping.

874
00:56:28,571 --> 00:56:31,192
TALIESIN: Was it a lot of water?

875
00:56:31,192 --> 00:56:37,234
MATT: It was a sizeable glass filled with water.

876
00:56:37,234 --> 00:56:42,422
TALIESIN: I'm going to do something very weird.
I'm going to walk over and dampen my hand on the

877
00:56:42,422 --> 00:56:47,569
water on his chest really quickly and (sniffing).

878
00:56:47,569 --> 00:56:51,674
MATT: It's briny and salty.

879
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:53,098
TALIESIN: Huh.

880
00:56:53,098 --> 00:56:55,317
SAM: Why are you drinking salt water?

881
00:56:55,317 --> 00:56:56,473
TALIESIN: You don't know that.

882
00:56:56,473 --> 00:56:59,173
SAM: Oh. (in Sam's voice) Why are you drinking 
salt water?

883
00:56:59,173 --> 00:57:02,631
(laughter)

884
00:57:02,705 --> 00:57:05,724
LAURA: Jeez, Fjord. That's a lot of drool.

885
00:57:05,724 --> 00:57:09,962
MARISHA: Does it taste like stomach acid? Because
that's gross, man.

886
00:57:09,962 --> 00:57:13,333
TALIESIN: Only one way to find out!

887
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:19,443
TRAVIS: Like a momma bird. Everybody have some of
what I puked up. It's all good.

888
00:57:19,443 --> 00:57:22,873
LIAM: I don't, I want to make an insight check. 
He's talking about acid reflux but he just spit a

889
00:57:22,873 --> 00:57:24,311
bunch of water out.

890
00:57:24,311 --> 00:57:25,687
MATT: Yeah, make an insight check.

891
00:57:25,687 --> 00:57:30,116
LIAM: Yeah, okay. That's 22.

892
00:57:30,116 --> 00:57:32,935
TRAVIS: Yeah, I don't think it was acid reflux.

893
00:57:32,935 --> 00:57:34,343
MARISHA: You taste like a seaman.

894
00:57:34,343 --> 00:57:39,164
(laughter)

895
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:48,266
TRAVIS: I don't know. I want to shake your hand,
but at the same time, I want to smash it.

896
00:57:48,266 --> 00:57:52,633
MATT: I've never been more proud of my wife.

897
00:57:52,633 --> 00:57:57,329
TAIESIN: That's not normal.

898
00:57:57,329 --> 00:58:00,455
LAURA: What happened, Fjord?

899
00:58:00,455 --> 00:58:02,516
LIAM: Does he seem full of shit to me?

900
00:58:02,516 --> 00:58:10,535
MATT: Seems like he's covering some confusion or
at least trying to deflect.

901
00:58:10,535 --> 00:58:19,932
TRAVIS: I had a dream, I'm sorry. A vivid one.
Just shook me to my core a little. I'll be fine,

902
00:58:19,932 --> 00:58:22,251
really. It's not a common thing.

903
00:58:22,251 --> 00:58:25,153
LAURA: Why the water, though?

904
00:58:25,153 --> 00:58:30,851
TRAVIS: I don't know.

905
00:58:30,851 --> 00:58:38,704
MARISHA: You never told me where you got that
sword. I mean, because I saw it get a little soggy,

906
00:58:38,704 --> 00:58:42,765
a little drippy, when we were fighting the frog
thing, so, you know.

907
00:58:42,765 --> 00:58:51,094
MATT: As you glance down at your sheath on the
ground, it is empty. There is no falchion.

908
00:58:51,094 --> 00:59:00,689
TRAVIS: Yeah. That sword is a pickle.

909
00:59:00,689 --> 00:59:05,758
MARISHA: It's a pickled sword? Are there benefits
to pickling your weapons?

910
00:59:05,758 --> 00:59:07,556
TRAVIS: It's a mystery.

911
00:59:07,556 --> 00:59:08,984
MARISHA: Oh, right.

912
00:59:08,984 --> 00:59:12,291
TALIESIN: He's not wrong, though. It actually is a
pickle. You can taste it.

913
00:59:12,291 --> 00:59:14,415
MARISHA: Yeah. It is very salty.

914
00:59:14,415 --> 00:59:15,970
LAURA: I do like pickles.

915
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:17,368
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's not bad.

916
00:59:17,368 --> 00:59:20,138
LIAM: Is our group going to be all about puns and
that stuff?

917
00:59:20,138 --> 00:59:23,321
SAM: It's the lowest form of humor.

918
00:59:23,321 --> 00:59:26,506
LAURA: Is it really the lowest?

919
00:59:26,506 --> 00:59:28,998
TALIESIN: Level three.

920
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:33,522
MARISHA: Okay, there are some pun competitions
that get serious.

921
00:59:33,522 --> 00:59:37,110
SAM: Are you all right, Fjord?

922
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:50,227
TRAVIS: Yeah. I feel funny. Caleb, you remember me
asking you about your arcane prowess?

923
00:59:50,227 --> 00:59:52,056
LIAM: Yeah.

924
00:59:52,056 --> 01:00:00,864
TRAVIS: My small experience with the arcane came
to me around the same time that sword did.

925
01:00:00,864 --> 01:00:03,787
LIAM: How long ago was that?

926
01:00:03,787 --> 01:00:09,305
TRAVIS: Not too long ago. Very recent. Right
before I met up with Jester.

927
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:12,830
SAM: Were you in the ocean?

928
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:26,907
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was. Did a lot of merchant
sailing, previously. Had one trip that didn't go

929
01:00:26,907 --> 01:00:36,179
so well. Suffice it to say, after it was done, I
found that sword.

930
01:00:36,179 --> 01:00:41,369
MARISHA: What happened on the trip? Rough waters?

931
01:00:41,369 --> 01:00:44,994
TRAVIS: Yeah.

932
01:00:44,994 --> 01:00:47,683
SAM: Did anyone die?

933
01:00:47,683 --> 01:00:52,533
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm not real comfortable talking
about it.

934
01:00:52,533 --> 01:00:57,048
LIAM: What about the sword? You said you found it
on the ocean, you found on the boat you were on?

935
01:00:57,048 --> 01:00:59,655
You were on an island? What do you mean?

936
01:00:59,655 --> 01:01:08,984
TRAVIS: I found it on the shore. When I got back
to land, it was just there. I'm not super familiar

937
01:01:08,984 --> 01:01:16,872
with a ton of weaponry-- the sword I know, I had
some training in it, but this seemed like a unique

938
01:01:16,872 --> 01:01:26,698
sword. I felt like it almost called to me. I know
how that sounds, but when I picked it up, seemed

939
01:01:26,698 --> 01:01:33,057
like everything changed. Ever since, I've been
able to do more things. Been able to reach out

940
01:01:33,057 --> 01:01:40,349
with some of the stuff I've seen you do. That's
why I'm trying to make it up to the Academy. I'm

941
01:01:40,349 --> 01:01:43,510
trying to figure out what it is that I have.

942
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:51,937
LIAM: DM, when I cast Detect Magic in the first
game, in the tavern, did that sword light up?

943
01:01:51,937 --> 01:01:55,187
MATT: No.

944
01:01:55,187 --> 01:02:02,264
TRAVIS: I don't mean to alarm any of you, really.
I'm trying to be as forthright as I can.

945
01:02:02,264 --> 01:02:04,852
TALIESIN: Where is the sword right now?

946
01:02:04,852 --> 01:02:10,401
TRAVIS: Can I make it appear?

947
01:02:10,401 --> 01:02:16,645
MATT: You look down, and it's not in the sheath.
You glance around, it's nowhere near you.

948
01:02:16,645 --> 01:02:22,641
TRAVIS: I focus. Reach down.

949
01:02:22,641 --> 01:02:30,868
MATT: He looks down at his open palm, and there is
a flash of greenish-blue, teal energy out of his

950
01:02:30,868 --> 01:02:41,606
grip. There, clutched within his grasp, you see
the falchion, coated in the remnants of sea floor

951
01:02:41,606 --> 01:02:46,658
life. You see the barnacles encrusted around the
edge and up the back of the blade, as it begins to

952
01:02:46,658 --> 01:02:51,159
drip water. The same kind that was coughed up by
Fjord this morning.

953
01:02:51,159 --> 01:02:59,128
TRAVIS: You can see why I'm a little curious about
this item.

954
01:02:59,128 --> 01:03:01,149
TALIESIN: That's a great trick.

955
01:03:01,149 --> 01:03:06,373
LIAM: I don't even need to touch it, but would you
trust me to study it for a moment?

956
01:03:06,373 --> 01:03:14,313
TRAVIS: Do you have any experience with items like
this?

957
01:03:14,313 --> 01:03:19,520
LIAM: I'm good at figuring things out. I'm
clever.

958
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:28,074
MARISHA: I might be able help you with that. I was
obsessed with underwater life and mermaids, so

959
01:03:28,074 --> 01:03:29,703
I've read a few books.

960
01:03:29,703 --> 01:03:36,043
TRAVIS: Could we revisit that idea, perhaps? I'm
sorry, the night has left me a bit shaken, and I

961
01:03:36,043 --> 01:03:41,723
feel like I need a moment to get my bearings, if
that's all right.

962
01:03:41,723 --> 01:03:47,460
LIAM: Ja, you can understand that we would be
curious, but I don't want to push anybody. I mean,

963
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:48,753
we've just met.

964
01:03:48,753 --> 01:03:53,265
TRAVIS: Of course not, and I don't want to make anyone
feel uneasy. Again, trying to be as transparent as

965
01:03:53,265 --> 01:04:04,586
I can. I don't quite understand, and I appreciate
your patience in advance. And I make it vanish.

966
01:04:04,586 --> 01:04:07,565
MATT: You watch as it just disappears out of your
grip.

967
01:04:07,565 --> 01:04:11,710
LIAM: When he says he doesn't quite understand, is
he telling the truth? Is that the same insight check?

968
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:13,957
MATT: You have to make a new one.

969
01:04:13,957 --> 01:04:19,622
LIAM: 11.

970
01:04:19,622 --> 01:04:21,099
TALIESIN: 23.

971
01:04:21,099 --> 01:04:22,594
MATT: 23.

972
01:04:22,594 --> 01:04:27,959
TALIESIN: This whole story, I've been watching.

973
01:04:27,959 --> 01:04:33,329
MATT: As far as you can tell, as forthright and
honest as you've heard him be.

974
01:04:33,329 --> 01:04:35,964
TALIESIN: That's so disappointing. All right.

975
01:04:35,964 --> 01:04:41,943
LAURA: Fjord, do you think you're slowly turning
into water?

976
01:04:41,943 --> 01:04:53,798
TRAVIS: (sighs) No. I hadn't considered that
terrifying thought, but thanks. I'll just add that

977
01:04:53,798 --> 01:04:55,983
to the fucking list.

978
01:04:55,983 --> 01:05:00,728
LAURA: If you feel like it's happening, let us
know and we'll try to catch you in a jar.

979
01:05:00,728 --> 01:05:02,731
TRAVIS: In a jar?

980
01:05:02,731 --> 01:05:05,077
TALIESIN: Unless he runs away.

981
01:05:05,077 --> 01:05:07,396
SAM: We're not going to let you run into the
dirt.

982
01:05:07,396 --> 01:05:09,840
LAURA: Maybe something can happen.

983
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:14,906
TRAVIS: Tell you what, I start sweating real hard,
I'll let you know, okay?

984
01:05:14,906 --> 01:05:16,479
TALIESIN: He's fine.

985
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:26,081
MARISHA: Has that happened to you before, by the
way? The whole, "waking up coughing salt water" thing?

986
01:05:26,081 --> 01:05:31,937
TRAVIS: I don't really remember.

987
01:05:31,937 --> 01:05:36,594
LIAM: You wouldn't have to remember that far back.
You said that this all started just a few weeks

988
01:05:36,594 --> 01:05:38,429
ago, when you met this one.

989
01:05:38,429 --> 01:05:44,595
TRAVIS: I don't really remember my dreams all that
well. They leave me quickly.

990
01:05:44,595 --> 01:05:48,816
TALIESIN: I remember all of mine, I don't know.

991
01:05:48,816 --> 01:05:51,760
LAURA: I've never seen him wake up with water all
over him.

992
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:58,983
MARISHA: Well, excited to see what unfolds. Shall
we?

993
01:05:58,983 --> 01:06:02,422
TALIESIN: If you're going to vomit something, salt
water's pretty decent. It could have been way worse.

994
01:06:02,422 --> 01:06:04,527
LAURA: Of all things, it's way better than vomit.

995
01:06:04,527 --> 01:06:08,847
TALIESIN: Oh, it's far superior. Already, you're
proving to be an asset.

996
01:06:08,847 --> 01:06:14,984
LAURA: If we get really thirsty, we'll just come
to you in the morning.

997
01:06:14,984 --> 01:06:19,058
TALIESIN: You can't drink-- the salt water makes
you thirstier.

998
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:20,317
LAURA: Oh, really?

999
01:06:20,317 --> 01:06:22,945
TALIESIN: It feels like you should be able to, but
you can't.

1000
01:06:22,945 --> 01:06:26,397
SAM: Should we get back on the road, then?

1001
01:06:26,397 --> 01:06:28,032
TRAVIS: If you wouldn't mind.

1002
01:06:28,032 --> 01:06:32,613
SAM: How is Horse doing today?

1003
01:06:32,613 --> 01:06:34,370
TRAVIS: Horse?

1004
01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:35,508
SAM: How's Horse?

1005
01:06:35,508 --> 01:06:36,570
LAURA: What is his name?

1006
01:06:36,570 --> 01:06:42,024
LIAM: I was wondering the very same thing,
actually, all night. I was wondering what we would call--

1007
01:06:42,024 --> 01:06:46,083
LAURA: This horse? Maybe he has a name. Molly?

1008
01:06:46,083 --> 01:06:50,602
TALIESIN: Does the horse have a name? If it did,
I'll make one up.

1009
01:06:50,602 --> 01:06:54,288
MATT: It probably had a few names, in travel, and
you've gone through a few horses.

1010
01:06:54,288 --> 01:06:58,031
TALIESIN: Try not to name them. We're just going
to end up eating them.

1011
01:06:58,031 --> 01:07:01,264
MATT: So whatever you come up with.

1012
01:07:01,264 --> 01:07:05,188
TALIESIN: His name was Winter's Crest. If he lived
that long, that was when we were going to butcher

1013
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:09,628
him and eat him. You can rename him, it's fine.

1014
01:07:09,628 --> 01:07:11,795
LAURA: I like it, it's like a celebration.

1015
01:07:11,795 --> 01:07:13,203
TALIESIN: That was the plan.

1016
01:07:13,203 --> 01:07:16,335
SAM: Maybe for short we'll call him W.C.

1017
01:07:16,335 --> 01:07:25,739
LIAM: You were going to butcher, at Winter's
Crest, and that's a special treat?

1018
01:07:25,739 --> 01:07:30,871
TALIESIN: It means you're going to eat meat, and
then you're going to make some jerky, and then

1019
01:07:30,871 --> 01:07:33,334
you're going to buy another horse with the money
you make.

1020
01:07:33,334 --> 01:07:40,665
MATT: Interesting point, too: For most of you,
Winter's Crest would have little meaning. It's

1021
01:07:40,665 --> 01:07:46,021
largely celebrated in continents to the west, as
it is specific to a historic event that did not

1022
01:07:46,021 --> 01:07:51,383
happen in Wildemount. But you're a carnival, so
you guys have more of a vast and strange knowledge.

1023
01:07:51,383 --> 01:07:52,778
TALIESIN: We celebrate everything.

1024
01:07:52,778 --> 01:07:55,623
MATT: When he says Winter's Crest, maybe Beau.

1025
01:07:55,623 --> 01:07:57,180
LIAM: Have I ever read about it?

1026
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:59,944
LAURA: I feel like my mom saw lots of visitors
from other places.

1027
01:07:59,944 --> 01:08:04,578
MATT: It's possible, but just for a bit of
information.

1028
01:08:04,578 --> 01:08:09,920
MARISHA: I feel like the snooty town that I came
from would have a Winter's Crest festival, like

1029
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:18,830
how we have Oktoberfests out here. Even though we
have no real business having them, yeah.

1030
01:08:18,830 --> 01:08:21,049
TALIESIN: Just glögg. Lots and lots of glögg.

1031
01:08:21,049 --> 01:08:26,839
MATT: As you guys look off, at this conversation
with the horse, the horse is currently about 30

1032
01:08:26,839 --> 01:08:30,354
feet off in the field, eating grass out of the
field.

1033
01:08:30,354 --> 01:08:35,209
TALIESIN: If you're on the road long enough, you
eat a lot of animals. You eat a lot of beasts of burden.

1034
01:08:35,209 --> 01:08:43,296
LAURA: I wander over to the wagon and I go and sit
down and start drawing, because I need to. I need

1035
01:08:43,296 --> 01:08:45,390
to spend a little time.

1036
01:08:45,390 --> 01:08:51,690
LIAM: I pull Nott over. Do you know what W.C.
means in Zemnian?

1037
01:08:51,690 --> 01:08:53,570
SAM: What does it mean?

1038
01:08:53,570 --> 01:08:54,967
LIAM: Toilet.

1039
01:08:54,967 --> 01:08:57,278
SAM: It's a pun.

1040
01:08:57,278 --> 01:09:00,867
(laughter)

1041
01:09:00,867 --> 01:09:03,256
LIAM: I give her a little fistbump.

1042
01:09:03,256 --> 01:09:09,828
MATT: As you guys gather up, in the fresh morning
air, back into the cart.

1043
01:09:09,828 --> 01:09:11,789
MARISHA: Do some pull-ups on the tree branches.

1044
01:09:11,789 --> 01:09:13,972
MATT: As Beau gets nice and swole for the
morning.

1045
01:09:13,972 --> 01:09:16,171
LIAM: Vasquez.

1046
01:09:16,171 --> 01:09:17,617
MARISHA: Just a little bit.

1047
01:09:17,617 --> 01:09:19,112
TRAVIS: You're just too bad, Vasquez.

1048
01:09:19,112 --> 01:09:29,183
MATT: (laughter) Vasquez is a pretty good print.
I think we were talking, Vasquez and Starbuck

1049
01:09:29,183 --> 01:09:37,884
from the new Battlestar are both good character
prints for Beau. Yeah, love that. As you guys

1050
01:09:37,884 --> 01:09:44,883
bring the cart back up onto the Amber Road,
northward, you begin your second-day trek. You

1051
01:09:44,883 --> 01:09:53,230
guys push on for a few hours. Is it still Beau and
Mollymauk keeping point?

1052
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:54,137
TALIESIN: I'll keep.

1053
01:09:54,137 --> 01:09:55,191
MARISHA: I don't mind.

1054
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,953
MATT: I'll have both of you roll a perception
check, please.

1055
01:09:56,953 --> 01:10:01,047
MARISHA: Do we have the highest perception?

1056
01:10:01,047 --> 01:10:03,100
TALIESIN: Ugh. I did until it bounced.

1057
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:07,271
MARISHA: Fuck. I almost got-- samesies. 11.

1058
01:10:07,271 --> 01:10:08,387
TALIESIN: Five.

1059
01:10:08,387 --> 01:10:09,541
MATT: Okay.

1060
01:10:09,541 --> 01:10:11,567
LAURA: I have decent perception, what's yours?

1061
01:10:11,567 --> 01:10:12,995
MATT: Calm fields.

1062
01:10:12,995 --> 01:10:18,631
TALIESIN: I might be distracted looking for things
that I can pluck out of the fields. All right.

1063
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:24,996
MATT: You push on for a few more hours, the
afternoon staring to get late. You can choose

1064
01:10:24,996 --> 01:10:30,781
soon, when it gets dark, to set up camp again and
stay another evening out in the fields, or you get

1065
01:10:30,781 --> 01:10:36,018
a sense looking at the map that you had procured
that if you push an extra hour or so past, you

1066
01:10:36,018 --> 01:10:39,750
could probably make it to Alfield before the
night's done.

1067
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:41,421
SAM: Let's do that.

1068
01:10:41,421 --> 01:10:43,065
TALIESIN: Most of us can see in the dark, it's not
a big deal.

1069
01:10:43,065 --> 01:10:44,333
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1070
01:10:44,333 --> 01:10:47,369
LAURA: Okay. You guys just hunker down in the
wagon, okay? You be safe.

1071
01:10:47,369 --> 01:10:48,571
MARISHA: Deal.

1072
01:10:48,571 --> 01:10:50,105
LIAM: Must be nice.

1073
01:10:50,105 --> 01:10:52,623
TRAVIS, LIAM, and TALIESIN: (singing) Must be
nice.

1074
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:54,441
TALIESIN: Can't say that, ah!

1075
01:10:54,441 --> 01:11:02,297
MATT: All righty. You guys push forward, kind of
pick up the pace a bit, but the horse and those of

1076
01:11:02,297 --> 01:11:06,730
you who are on the sides of the cart, if you wish
to, you can jog along the side to alleviate some

1077
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:07,602
of the burden.

1078
01:11:07,602 --> 01:11:09,017
MARISHA: I'm going to scan still while I'm--

1079
01:11:09,017 --> 01:11:10,176
MATT: Keeping an eye out.

1080
01:11:10,176 --> 01:11:11,485
MARISHA: With my shitty vision.

1081
01:11:11,485 --> 01:11:20,091
MATT: Okay. The sun does eventually close towards
the Cyrios Mountains to the west and night begins

1082
01:11:20,091 --> 01:11:27,063
to fall. At this point, you do see just over the
distance in the hill as darkness comes, you can

1083
01:11:27,063 --> 01:11:35,016
see the faint glow, a cluster of light, of a
village in the distant hills. You get the sense

1084
01:11:35,016 --> 01:11:42,232
that this is probably Alfield at the perimeter of
your vision. As you continue to push forward,

1085
01:11:42,232 --> 01:11:47,949
you've now gone past eight hours of continuous
travel into the ninth hour. I would like you all

1086
01:11:47,949 --> 01:11:51,712
to roll a constitution saving throw, please.

1087
01:11:51,712 --> 01:11:56,841
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Natural 20.

1088
01:11:56,841 --> 01:12:00,935
LAURA: Whoa. That's because you guys are-- oh, no,
you're riding in the cart.

1089
01:12:00,935 --> 01:12:02,087
MARISHA: I'm riding.

1090
01:12:02,087 --> 01:12:03,192
TRAVIS: 16.

1091
01:12:03,192 --> 01:12:04,595
MARISHA: I'm just like: What's wrong?

1092
01:12:04,595 --> 01:12:07,967
LIAM, SAM, and LAURA: Nine.

1093
01:12:07,967 --> 01:12:13,213
MATT: Nine as well? Wow. It's like Rammstein on
that side of the table.

1094
01:12:13,213 --> 01:12:16,331
(laughter)

1095
01:12:16,331 --> 01:12:18,639
TRAVIS: Nein! Cookie monster.

1096
01:12:18,639 --> 01:12:21,114
MATT: All right. So the three of you take one
level of exhaustion.

1097
01:12:21,114 --> 01:12:24,326
LAURA: Aw. How do we do that in here?

1098
01:12:24,326 --> 01:12:25,993
LIAM: How does that affect us, again?

1099
01:12:25,993 --> 01:12:30,671
MATT: This is a good thing to look up.
Essentially, per point of exhaustion--

1100
01:12:30,671 --> 01:12:32,510
TALIESIN: So you go to your HP.

1101
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:38,692
MATT: There you go. So you have disadvantage on
ability checks until you take a long rest to get

1102
01:12:38,692 --> 01:12:40,036
rid of it.

1103
01:12:40,036 --> 01:12:41,260
LAURA: Disadvantage on abilities?

1104
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:43,241
MATT: Yes. On ability checks, so skills and things
like that.

1105
01:12:43,241 --> 01:12:45,293
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

1106
01:12:45,293 --> 01:12:51,981
MATT: All right. You guys are-- you're a few--
you're probably about a half mile away from

1107
01:12:51,981 --> 01:12:59,928
Alfield and it looks, even at this distance, a bit
smaller than Trostenwald, where you were. You can

1108
01:12:59,928 --> 01:13:05,147
see the faint clusters of trees on the north,
eastern and northeastern sides of the city,

1109
01:13:05,147 --> 01:13:12,310
otherwise it's just in this pocket behind a few
hills. It's a bit podunk in size, you can gather

1110
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:22,192
from this distance, but it's welcoming. There's a
flash of orange light on the outskirts of town.

1111
01:13:22,192 --> 01:13:24,730
LIAM: Did that look arcane to me?

1112
01:13:24,730 --> 01:13:30,083
MATT: No, it just looked like a flash. I mean, it
could have been arcane. It's hard to tell at this

1113
01:13:30,083 --> 01:13:31,595
distance, it's quite a ways away.

1114
01:13:31,595 --> 01:13:33,051
TALIESIN: That's weird.

1115
01:13:33,051 --> 01:13:40,779
MATT: There's a second one. (flash) You faintly
see what looks like the distant curl of flames

1116
01:13:40,779 --> 01:13:43,405
beginning to spread across what appears to be a
roof.

1117
01:13:43,405 --> 01:13:44,690
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

1118
01:13:44,690 --> 01:13:45,768
LAURA: Oh no.

1119
01:13:45,768 --> 01:13:49,210
MARISHA: Think we just watched someone commit
arson, you guys!

1120
01:13:49,210 --> 01:13:50,916
TRAVIS: That's not really a--

1121
01:13:50,916 --> 01:13:52,320
MARISHA: Let's go kick their ass.

1122
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:53,542
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's do that.

1123
01:13:53,542 --> 01:13:55,390
LAURA: Does it look like the fire is spreading at
all?

1124
01:13:55,390 --> 01:13:56,839
MATT: I mean, as you sit here and watch--

1125
01:13:56,839 --> 01:13:58,026
LAURA: We're walking.

1126
01:13:58,026 --> 01:14:00,464
TALIESIN: Let's head that direction and start
yelling at people.

1127
01:14:00,464 --> 01:14:01,746
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Full sprint.

1128
01:14:01,746 --> 01:14:03,028
TRAVIS: Fire!

1129
01:14:03,028 --> 01:14:08,529
MATT: You guys begin to go into a faster jog in
that direction. As you do, you can see the fire is

1130
01:14:08,529 --> 01:14:14,263
now beginning to consume a handful of buildings
and the flames are beginning to flicker higher.

1131
01:14:14,263 --> 01:14:23,515
You begin to hear in the distance a very faint
high-pitched yelp or some sort of a screech. It's

1132
01:14:23,515 --> 01:14:27,632
hard to make it out at this distance, it's an open
field area and it's mingling with what sounds like

1133
01:14:27,632 --> 01:14:36,694
now dozens of voices screaming and entwining. As
you can see the uncontrolled flames still

1134
01:14:36,694 --> 01:14:42,742
progressing on the eastern side of the village,
you can just see, as you get within a few hundred

1135
01:14:42,742 --> 01:14:49,946
feet of the western side of Alfield, people just
running. Villagers, probably a few hundred of

1136
01:14:49,946 --> 01:14:56,288
them, are now just running out of the town as you
guys begin to approach. Towards you and out into

1137
01:14:56,288 --> 01:14:58,863
the field. So as you're approaching, they're
coming your direction.

1138
01:14:58,863 --> 01:15:01,073
TALIESIN: I'm going to stop one and ask what
happened.

1139
01:15:01,073 --> 01:15:08,343
MATT: As you glance over, you see a family of five
halflings rushing right past you. The mother is

1140
01:15:08,343 --> 01:15:12,304
dragging two of the younger ones by the hand while
the father is running alongside the eldest

1141
01:15:12,304 --> 01:15:17,220
daughter, probably in her teens. The father wears
a leather cap and has a handlebar mustache and

1142
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:21,086
simple farm clothing. As you shout out, he makes
your eye contact.

1143
01:15:21,086 --> 01:15:22,710
TALIESIN: What has happened?

1144
01:15:22,710 --> 01:15:26,854
MATT: "Oh, I don't know what happened. They
started to burn the buildings and these things

1145
01:15:26,854 --> 01:15:29,897
"started rushing. The city is under attack."

1146
01:15:29,897 --> 01:15:31,358
LAURA: What things?

1147
01:15:31,358 --> 01:15:37,850
MATT: (panicked) "Big things. Dog-faced. I can't--
Come on." They just keep running.

1148
01:15:37,850 --> 01:15:40,193
LAURA: Dogs are attacking the village!

1149
01:15:40,193 --> 01:15:45,134
MATT: At this point, you guys can see more people
are fleeing. As you get closer, about 100 feet

1150
01:15:45,134 --> 01:15:51,227
outside the city, you watch as the droves of
people are beginning to get-- at least either the

1151
01:15:51,227 --> 01:15:54,470
ones that are actively fleeing have made it out of
the city, or in the process the stragglers are still

1152
01:15:54,470 --> 01:16:02,300
coming through. You see a young human man with
scrappy, tattered brown hair, a bit of blood

1153
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:07,676
dripping down his face, running before his back
arches and he falls into the grass. You can see an

1154
01:16:07,676 --> 01:16:13,021
arrow protruding from his back. At that point, you
can see, standing up from behind one of the

1155
01:16:13,021 --> 01:16:19,846
exterior walls of the city, a humanoid creature
stretching up to about seven feet tall, muscular

1156
01:16:19,846 --> 01:16:26,356
torso with thin dog-like legs. You watch as it
extends its neck with spots of fur, its ears

1157
01:16:26,356 --> 01:16:30,511
curled upwards as it has a dog-like snout at the
front of it.

1158
01:16:30,511 --> 01:16:32,324
LAURA: Werewolves!

1159
01:16:32,324 --> 01:16:39,421
MATT: You watch as it leaps onto the back of this
fallen villager, bites into the shoulder, and tears

1160
01:16:39,421 --> 01:16:45,757
a chunk out. Swallows it before it growls into the
air (yipping howl).

1161
01:16:45,757 --> 01:16:47,553
LAURA: Is that a werehyena?

1162
01:16:47,553 --> 01:16:49,898
SAM: Have we seen these things before?

1163
01:16:49,898 --> 01:16:53,174
MATT: You have. You've encountered a roving band
of these on your way southward.

1164
01:16:53,174 --> 01:16:54,761
LAURA: What is it?

1165
01:16:54,761 --> 01:17:00,992
SAM: I think they're-- well, we don't know what
they're called. We just fought them. I don't know

1166
01:17:00,992 --> 01:17:02,887
what they're called; we fought one before!

1167
01:17:02,887 --> 01:17:04,206
LAURA: You know how to kill them?

1168
01:17:04,206 --> 01:17:06,017
SAM: You just hurt them until they die.

1169
01:17:06,017 --> 01:17:13,576
MATT: It swallows the flesh, grabs the body, and
then darts back into the city, dragging the corpse

1170
01:17:13,576 --> 01:17:15,966
of the villager it's just killed with it
rapidly.

1171
01:17:16,006 --> 01:17:17,505
TALIESIN: That's weird.

1172
01:17:17,505 --> 01:17:21,327
LIAM: Is it a walled-in city or just parts here
and there?

1173
01:17:21,327 --> 01:17:25,271
MATT: No. They're small and waist high, and
shoulder high walls that are partitions here and

1174
01:17:25,271 --> 01:17:27,403
there, but it's largely a farming city.

1175
01:17:27,403 --> 01:17:28,338
LIAM: Not fortified at all?

1176
01:17:28,338 --> 01:17:29,332
MATT: No, not at all.

1177
01:17:29,332 --> 01:17:30,743
LAURA: Is he within range to hit with a spell?

1178
01:17:30,743 --> 01:17:34,825
MATT: No, he's about-- well, depends on the spell.
Right now he's about 200 feet from you and he's

1179
01:17:34,825 --> 01:17:38,775
running into the city. You can see the flames are
further in but you can see the orange glow

1180
01:17:38,775 --> 01:17:40,155
flickering in the distance.

1181
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:43,639
MARISHA: Can I do a quick scan and see if I see
more?

1182
01:17:43,639 --> 01:17:45,272
MATT: Perception check.

1183
01:17:45,272 --> 01:17:50,314
MARISHA: Don't fuck this up. That's okay, 17.

1184
01:17:50,314 --> 01:17:55,857
MATT: 17. In the immediate vicinity, you do not.
You see more people from the village starting to

1185
01:17:55,857 --> 01:18:00,819
run out, screaming. You see a handful of
crownsguard come out, one of them looks wounded

1186
01:18:00,819 --> 01:18:06,573
and is, "To the north. Where are they coming
from?" You see the two of them dart off northward

1187
01:18:06,573 --> 01:18:08,753
into the city. What are you guys doing?

1188
01:18:08,753 --> 01:18:10,270
TRAVIS: I chase after the crownsguard.

1189
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:11,475
MATT: Okay.

1190
01:18:11,475 --> 01:18:14,496
LAURA: Go after the one that stole the guy.

1191
01:18:14,496 --> 01:18:16,168
MARISHA: We'll go after the one that stole the
guy.

1192
01:18:16,168 --> 01:18:19,236
TALIESIN: Is this making my spider sense tingle,
can I track them?

1193
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:21,256
MATT: No.

1194
01:18:21,256 --> 01:18:22,443
TALIESIN: Okay.

1195
01:18:22,443 --> 01:18:28,643
MATT: You get the sense, at the moment, there's no
active idea that these would be considered a

1196
01:18:28,643 --> 01:18:30,243
creature that would draw your attention.

1197
01:18:30,243 --> 01:18:31,685
TALIESIN: Okay, all right.

1198
01:18:31,685 --> 01:18:34,633
MATT: Are you leaving the cart there, on the
outskirts?

1199
01:18:34,633 --> 01:18:35,702
TRAVIS: Yes.

1200
01:18:35,702 --> 01:18:38,293
LIAM: We leave the toilet behind and we run in.

1201
01:18:38,293 --> 01:18:43,012
MATT: All right, as you go charging into the city,
you're pushing past fleeing villagers and you can

1202
01:18:43,012 --> 01:18:47,252
see some of the buildings now have been locked
shut. You can see faintly through the windows

1203
01:18:47,252 --> 01:18:51,670
furniture being boarded up from the inside. People
are hunkering down for whatever this assault is.

1204
01:18:51,670 --> 01:18:56,814
As you enter, you see the crownsguard went
northward but the one creature that you saw charge

1205
01:18:56,814 --> 01:19:01,890
in went straight towards the heart. Right now you
can see there's two main streets that bisect this

1206
01:19:01,890 --> 01:19:07,264
small village. There's one that goes at an angle,
northwest to southeast. One that goes right

1207
01:19:07,264 --> 01:19:11,988
towards the center, west to east. As you head
towards the center you can see the flames are more

1208
01:19:11,988 --> 01:19:17,792
near that central square. As you guys begin to
run, push past a few more people, the smoke is

1209
01:19:17,792 --> 01:19:22,299
starting to billow up and you can see now there's
embers rising and then falling. This very faint

1210
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:28,341
ashy rain of small points of reddish-orange light
that begin to fall with the ash. As you turn

1211
01:19:28,341 --> 01:19:33,666
around one of the buildings, there's one of the
side walls and four crownsguard all ducked down

1212
01:19:33,666 --> 01:19:40,311
behind the wall with crossbows and longbows, all
back behind it. You can see one that's adorned

1213
01:19:40,311 --> 01:19:50,509
with more ornate armor. You see a person there
with elven features, but hint at a mixed

1214
01:19:50,578 --> 01:19:55,181
lineage. They have their helmet on the ground,
showing shoulder-length blond hair that's turned

1215
01:19:55,221 --> 01:20:00,297
red in places from a spattering of gore. Through
gritted teeth they curse in pain as the bandages

1216
01:20:00,297 --> 01:20:04,746
are applied to what you can see is a wound right
around the midsection in the thigh area. Another

1217
01:20:04,746 --> 01:20:10,582
soldier is in the process of wrapping it. You
watch as they go, "Gah! You fool, bind the wound,

1218
01:20:10,582 --> 01:20:16,733
"don't stuff it." Goes and they pull a bolt back
into the crossbow and nock it at the ready.

1219
01:20:16,733 --> 01:20:23,382
Glancing up and seeing you approach, they scan
past you-- most of you now with weapons at the

1220
01:20:23,382 --> 01:20:31,475
ready, it seems, charging forward. "You!" You
suddenly have an array of arrows, about five or

1221
01:20:31,475 --> 01:20:35,812
six, come over the wall. One of them manages to
pierce the back of one of the crownsguards' heads

1222
01:20:35,812 --> 01:20:43,816
and falls and crumples to the ground. They all get
lower again. You hear in the distance (growling yips).

1223
01:20:43,816 --> 01:20:49,781
The individual looks back to you. "You, are
you able-bodied?"

1224
01:20:49,781 --> 01:20:51,066
LAURA: Yeah.

1225
01:20:51,066 --> 01:20:52,230
SAM: Very.

1226
01:20:52,230 --> 01:20:53,660
MATT: "And you're armed."

1227
01:20:53,660 --> 01:20:55,055
TRAVIS: We are.

1228
01:20:55,055 --> 01:20:58,591
MATT: "30 gold a gnoll ear. Now get in there and
help."

1229
01:20:58,591 --> 01:21:00,206
TRAVIS: A gnoll?

1230
01:21:00,206 --> 01:21:02,025
MARISHA: 30 gold a gnoll ear?

1231
01:21:02,025 --> 01:21:03,899
LAURA: For each one? How many are there?

1232
01:21:03,899 --> 01:21:05,517
TRAVIS: Just go get them.

1233
01:21:05,517 --> 01:21:10,148
MATT: They give you a look like-- "Just go!"

1234
01:21:10,148 --> 01:21:13,293
LAURA: I just don't want to get overwhelmed is
all.

1235
01:21:13,293 --> 01:21:18,745
MARISHA: Nott and Jester, do you guys have ways to
block arrows?

1236
01:21:18,745 --> 01:21:22,040
MATT: (whoosh) Two of them glace up and fire two
crossbow bolts over the wall and duck back behind.

1237
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:28,536
You hear a heavy smashing of wood, some more barks
and gibbering echoing around the way. You can see

1238
01:21:28,536 --> 01:21:32,536
now flames curling up to the top of the building
that you're all right next to, before the small

1239
01:21:32,613 --> 01:21:34,963
wall that bisects the entryway.

1240
01:21:34,963 --> 01:21:36,214
LAURA: I have a shield.

1241
01:21:36,214 --> 01:21:37,893
TALIESIN: I start one of my swords on the back of
my neck.

1242
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:41,243
LIAM : We are sitting ducks here. What do we do,
Fjord?

1243
01:21:41,243 --> 01:21:43,071
TRAVIS: It's all on the other side of a wall?

1244
01:21:43,071 --> 01:21:44,284
MATT: Correct.

1245
01:21:44,284 --> 01:21:45,959
MARISHA: Let's go towards the wall.

1246
01:21:45,959 --> 01:21:47,756
MATT: To give you perspective now.

1247
01:21:47,756 --> 01:21:52,892
SAM: Oh. This'll help. Hey side note: where's my
fucking wine?

1248
01:21:52,892 --> 01:21:55,360
LAURA: Did you leave it?

1249
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:56,956
TRAVIS: You mean your water?

1250
01:21:56,956 --> 01:21:58,291
MARISHA: Did you leave it outside?

1251
01:21:58,291 --> 01:21:59,446
SAM: Is it gone?

1252
01:21:59,446 --> 01:22:00,845
MARISHA: No, it's just on the table.

1253
01:22:00,845 --> 01:22:06,344
LAURA: Whoa! Oh my gosh. Where are we?

1254
01:22:06,344 --> 01:22:09,522
MATT: You guys--

1255
01:22:09,522 --> 01:22:13,234
LAURA: This is so cool. Look at that flame on the
side of the roof.

1256
01:22:13,234 --> 01:22:22,705
MATT: You are all right over this side area,
corner. Arrange yourself as you feel you wish to

1257
01:22:22,705 --> 01:22:27,862
be. Over there on the far end of the village.

1258
01:22:27,862 --> 01:22:30,180
SAM: Oh wow. What a cool map.

1259
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:33,130
MATT: If you wish to, you can place yourselves
where you wish or show me where you want them to go.

1260
01:22:33,130 --> 01:22:39,879
LIAM: I would be pressed against the wall of that
house.

1261
01:22:39,879 --> 01:22:41,449
MATT: Right here?

1262
01:22:41,449 --> 01:22:46,426
LAURA: Before I ran over here, I'm going to Caleb.
I'll hit you on the shoulder and say, bless you.

1263
01:22:46,426 --> 01:22:51,487
And I'm going to give you Blessing of the
Trickster just in case you want to stealth because

1264
01:22:51,487 --> 01:22:53,105
you're squishy, yo.

1265
01:22:53,105 --> 01:22:54,658
LIAM: Okay, so I have advantage on stealth?

1266
01:22:54,658 --> 01:22:55,550
LAURA: Yes.

1267
01:22:55,550 --> 01:22:56,467
LIAM: Thank you.

1268
01:22:56,467 --> 01:22:57,756
MARISHA: I'll be with Jester.

1269
01:22:57,756 --> 01:23:02,063
SAM: The enemies are just all over that
direction, right?

1270
01:23:02,063 --> 01:23:05,702
MATT: With what little bit you've looked over to
the side you can see there are some up on the

1271
01:23:05,702 --> 01:23:10,529
rooftops in the distance. You can see their dark
figures silhouetted by flames, and other bits of

1272
01:23:10,529 --> 01:23:16,919
light that normally fill the streets in the center
of the city. Most you can see are these up here and

1273
01:23:16,919 --> 01:23:20,343
you can already see a few bodies of guards and
civilians that are lying on the ground, carved

1274
01:23:20,381 --> 01:23:24,925
open and not moving. You see spatters of blood.
You still hear them barking and giving orders next

1275
01:23:24,925 --> 01:23:27,546
to each other (rabid barking).

1276
01:23:27,546 --> 01:23:33,858
LAURA: How far away are the ones on the roof?
How long is the distance from us?

1277
01:23:33,858 --> 01:23:37,657
MATT: Over here? At this distance it's hard to
say. I'd say probably in the neighborhood of about

1278
01:23:37,657 --> 01:23:45,910
70 to 80 feet from you. You guys, I would like, if
you are trying to stay out of sight, make a

1279
01:23:45,910 --> 01:23:50,263
stealth check, please. Those of you with a point
of exhaustion, you have disadvantage.

1280
01:23:50,263 --> 01:23:53,588
MARISHA: Natural 19.

1281
01:23:53,588 --> 01:23:57,649
LAURA: Six.

1282
01:23:57,649 --> 01:23:59,166
TALIESIN: 21.

1283
01:23:59,166 --> 01:24:00,376
SAM: 15.

1284
01:24:00,376 --> 01:24:01,446
LIAM: 16.

1285
01:24:01,446 --> 01:24:02,605
MARISHA: 25.

1286
01:24:02,605 --> 01:24:03,644
TRAVIS: 14.

1287
01:24:03,644 --> 01:24:07,488
SAM: So revealing--

1288
01:24:07,488 --> 01:24:09,488
LAURA: Yeah, well, I'm exhausted.

1289
01:24:09,488 --> 01:24:14,325
MATT: That's okay. As a group, for the moment you
guys haven't drawn their attention. You're still

1290
01:24:14,325 --> 01:24:19,358
right next to where there are crownsguard who are
in the process of a firefight with whatever is in

1291
01:24:19,358 --> 01:24:27,170
this vicinity of the city. However, you may or may
not make it through, for the moment, unseen. You're

1292
01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:32,075
not certain how many there are. But you can hear a
lot of yipping and growling right around this

1293
01:24:32,075 --> 01:24:36,458
large, two-story building that is currently
engulfed in flames.

1294
01:24:36,458 --> 01:24:41,041
SAM: I have an idea. We need to move away from
here, right, Fjord?

1295
01:24:41,041 --> 01:24:43,424
TRAVIS: We do. We have to use the cover of the
buildings.

1296
01:24:43,424 --> 01:24:50,825
SAM: All right, I think I can do something that
would make them fire many of their arrows at

1297
01:24:50,825 --> 01:24:56,272
something, but not us. Should I do that and then
as soon as they fire their arrows we can run?

1298
01:24:56,272 --> 01:24:57,781
TRAVIS: Diversions are absolutely--

1299
01:24:57,781 --> 01:25:05,372
SAM: Diversions! That's what it's called, it's a
diversion. All right, may I move, is that a thing?

1300
01:25:05,372 --> 01:25:07,052
MATT: You may, you're stealthed currently.

1301
01:25:07,052 --> 01:25:13,048
SAM: I take out a bit of fleece, and repeating the
words and doing the hand gestures that I've been

1302
01:25:13,048 --> 01:25:22,243
taught and tracing the image of a creature on the
fleece, I will make a Silent Image of the guard

1303
01:25:22,243 --> 01:25:30,515
who told us 30 gold a gnoll. I'm going to have the
image of that guard dash across, slowly, dash

1304
01:25:30,515 --> 01:25:33,216
across this alleyway. Like that way.

1305
01:25:33,216 --> 01:25:35,738
LIAM: Maybe amble more than dash.

1306
01:25:35,738 --> 01:25:40,882
SAM: Yes, not dash, just walk in a way that he
could be easily shot.

1307
01:25:40,882 --> 01:25:46,366
MATT: Interesting point of order, you're not too
certain of the gender of this individual, kind of fluid.

1308
01:25:46,366 --> 01:25:49,298
SAM: Okay, great, that long-haired guard
individual.

1309
01:25:49,298 --> 01:25:55,422
MATT: There you go. As the figure leaps over the
wall and begins making a run towards the center

1310
01:25:55,422 --> 01:26:03,249
area, about four different arrows pass through its
form before one of these gnoll creatures goes

1311
01:26:03,249 --> 01:26:08,681
lumbering forward and slashes out to it. This
gnoll, interestingly enough-- the other ones you

1312
01:26:08,681 --> 01:26:13,674
see and the one you saw before the city are all
built and muscular. This one seems to be porous.

1313
01:26:13,674 --> 01:26:19,903
With a brief bit of view, you can see there's
clumps of fur and exposed bone and part of its

1314
01:26:19,903 --> 01:26:26,018
skull is just pushing out of its snout with teeth
gnashing. As it tears into the illusion, it claws

1315
01:26:26,018 --> 01:26:32,538
through, confused, and looks over in your direction.
As you're finishing drawing your blade across your

1316
01:26:32,538 --> 01:26:38,475
back, what normally would be cold energy suddenly
flickers into this beacon of bright white light.

1317
01:26:38,475 --> 01:26:43,326
SAM: Ooh, nice.

1318
01:26:43,326 --> 01:26:46,728
MATT: Something clicks in your mind and you're
like, "Oh, I know you."

1319
01:26:46,728 --> 01:26:49,978
TALIESIN: I'm preparing. How close am I to this
thing?

1320
01:26:49,978 --> 01:26:54,318
MATT: This entity would be here now. It would have
just left out into that section there.

1321
01:26:54,318 --> 01:26:55,761
TALIESIN: Does it see us?

1322
01:26:55,761 --> 01:26:57,051
MATT: It does now.

1323
01:26:57,051 --> 01:26:59,288
TALIESIN: I'm going to use Vicious Mockery at it,
really quickly.

1324
01:26:59,288 --> 01:27:00,490
MATT: All right.

1325
01:27:00,490 --> 01:27:01,978
LAURA: Can I invoke Duplicity?

1326
01:27:01,978 --> 01:27:05,289
MATT: You may. I'm giving you all one round
preparation before we roll initiative.

1327
01:27:05,289 --> 01:27:11,732
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was going to say, we're in it.
This is a fight. So anything you want to do now,

1328
01:27:11,732 --> 01:27:13,238
do it.

1329
01:27:13,238 --> 01:27:20,047
LIAM: I mutter a few words and my form starts to
blink in and out of view. There is another Caleb

1330
01:27:20,047 --> 01:27:25,137
next to me and another Caleb next to me. Shifting,
blinking, flashing back and forth and it's hard to

1331
01:27:25,137 --> 01:27:26,638
see where I am.

1332
01:27:26,638 --> 01:27:29,156
MATT: Okay. Is that concentration?

1333
01:27:29,156 --> 01:27:30,532
LIAM: Yeah, it is.

1334
01:27:30,532 --> 01:27:33,509
MATT: All right, I'm going to put a concentration
marker on you just so we remember it.

1335
01:27:33,509 --> 01:27:41,083
TRAVIS: Can I also, knowing that we're probably
going to be up close, danger close, I'm going to

1336
01:27:41,083 --> 01:27:48,384
cast Armor of Agathys on myself. You see a
spectral frost start to harden around my armor in

1337
01:27:48,384 --> 01:27:50,244
a shimmering light.

1338
01:27:50,244 --> 01:27:55,339
MATT: That's cool. So that's you. That's you.
You're going to Vicious Mockery.

1339
01:27:55,339 --> 01:27:59,808
TALIESIN: I'm going to use Vicious Mockery. I'm
going to look at him with my eyes glowing, and my

1340
01:27:59,808 --> 01:28:07,282
sword glowing, and in Infernal say, (rasping) The
light comes to blind your eyes and burn your

1341
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:10,191
flesh. Yeah, 1d4.

1342
01:28:10,191 --> 01:28:14,967
MATT: He rolled a 13 minus three. I believe it's
wisdom, correct?

1343
01:28:14,967 --> 01:28:17,579
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's a wisdom saving throw.

1344
01:28:17,579 --> 01:28:21,156
MATT: I'm pretty sure that's a ten and that does
not make your DC.

1345
01:28:21,156 --> 01:28:32,118
TALIESIN: Yup, so he takes three psychic damage
and he has disadvantage on his next attack roll.

1346
01:28:32,118 --> 01:28:33,235
MATT: Yes.

1347
01:28:33,235 --> 01:28:36,297
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my bonus action-- yeah,
fuck it, let's go for it-- I'm going to activate

1348
01:28:36,297 --> 01:28:37,540
both swords.

1349
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:39,935
MATT: You drag the other edge of your blade--

1350
01:28:39,935 --> 01:28:41,215
TALIESIN: Should I? Yeah.

1351
01:28:41,215 --> 01:28:47,957
MATT: You've taken a total of six damage and your
max HP is down by six. But you have currently the

1352
01:28:47,957 --> 01:28:50,532
new invoked Rite on each blade.

1353
01:28:50,532 --> 01:28:53,678
LAURA: Can I use my bonus action really fast?

1354
01:28:53,678 --> 01:28:54,958
MATT: You may.

1355
01:28:54,958 --> 01:29:02,783
LAURA: To say a little pray to the Traveler, and
I'm going to cast Spiritual Weapon.

1356
01:29:02,783 --> 01:29:05,644
MATT: You may do that. Where are you going to cast
it?

1357
01:29:05,644 --> 01:29:11,640
LAURA: I'm going to cast it right above this
zombie gnoll. It's going to be in the shape of a

1358
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:19,736
giant lollipop. Like a bludgeoning lollipop.

1359
01:29:19,736 --> 01:29:30,308
MATT: You watch as this flash of purplish energy
suddenly apparates into the air. This thick-like

1360
01:29:30,308 --> 01:29:37,523
wooden handle that is jammed into a massive,
bludgeoning, solid piece of sugary goodness.

1361
01:29:37,523 --> 01:29:39,133
LAURA: Yes!

1362
01:29:39,133 --> 01:29:40,520
LIAM: The old fashioned swirly kind?

1363
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:41,639
LAURA: Yeah!

1364
01:29:41,639 --> 01:29:47,978
MATT: With that, you can make an attack with that
as soon as it comes out. Make a melee spell

1365
01:29:47,978 --> 01:29:49,528
attack, please.

1366
01:29:49,528 --> 01:29:52,697
LAURA: Okay, 17?

1367
01:29:52,697 --> 01:29:54,330
MATT: 17 does hit.

1368
01:29:54,330 --> 01:30:00,288
LAURA: Ooh, seven. Seven radiant damage.

1369
01:30:00,288 --> 01:30:06,501
MATT: Seven radiant damage, nice. As it strikes
down, wham! From the creature, already watching

1370
01:30:06,501 --> 01:30:09,731
its bones and its form shakes--

1371
01:30:09,731 --> 01:30:14,436
LAURA: Oh wait, oh wait, oh wait, I was looking at
the wrong spell, hold on. Oh, 1d8 plus three!

1372
01:30:14,436 --> 01:30:16,843
Seven plus three-- Ten!

1373
01:30:16,843 --> 01:30:22,838
MATT: Ten. Oh, that'll be enough. You watch as it
pulls back with the Infernal shouting of Mollymauk

1374
01:30:22,838 --> 01:30:29,594
causing it to prepare itself for a lunge. As it
gets low, its jaw snapping open, you watch as bits

1375
01:30:29,594 --> 01:30:35,932
of its skin fall onto the ground as it does so
(snarl). And right before it leaps, (wham) it just

1376
01:30:35,932 --> 01:30:39,537
smashes it into the ground and its bones go flying
and scattering in every which direction.

1377
01:30:39,537 --> 01:30:41,183
ALL: Oh!

1378
01:30:41,183 --> 01:30:43,681
TRAVIS: Is that one of the were-thingies? Damn!

1379
01:30:43,681 --> 01:30:45,215
LAURA: That ear is mine!

1380
01:30:45,215 --> 01:30:52,354
MATT: All right, so Beau, what are you doing? You
all have one round of prep. Right now, you've gone--

1381
01:30:52,354 --> 01:30:54,459
SAM: I cast a spell. Can I also move?

1382
01:30:54,459 --> 01:30:55,639
MATT: You can move, yeah.

1383
01:30:55,639 --> 01:30:59,800
SAM: As soon as the arrows flew by, I'm going to
dash across the alley.

1384
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:01,000
MATT: Okay.

1385
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,155
LAURA: And I'm going to send my duplicate after
her.

1386
01:31:03,155 --> 01:31:06,476
MATT: Okay. You're running that way?

1387
01:31:06,476 --> 01:31:08,038
SAM: Yep. As far as I can go.

1388
01:31:08,038 --> 01:31:13,944
MATT: All right. And you send your duplicate over
there as well?

1389
01:31:13,944 --> 01:31:14,959
LAURA: Yeah.

1390
01:31:14,959 --> 01:31:17,591
MATT: All righty. And Beau?

1391
01:31:17,591 --> 01:31:27,665
MARISHA: I'm also going to use my speed to dash
across. I can move 40. Can I peek into this window

1392
01:31:27,665 --> 01:31:29,729
and see if I can see anything in here?

1393
01:31:29,729 --> 01:31:34,984
MATT: Sure. Easy to see in this perspective. You
glance inside--

1394
01:31:34,984 --> 01:31:36,289
MARISHA: Stealthily?

1395
01:31:36,289 --> 01:31:39,738
MATT: All right. As you glance inside, you can
just barely see around the corner. The place is

1396
01:31:39,738 --> 01:31:47,792
tossed. It is shattered and ruined. It looks like
it was once the interior of a small tavern of some

1397
01:31:47,792 --> 01:31:52,811
kind, but the kitchen is wrecked and you can see
two of these gnolls are in the process of grabbing

1398
01:31:52,811 --> 01:31:56,708
large sacks out of the kitchen and pulling them
out through the front door on the opposite side of

1399
01:31:56,708 --> 01:31:57,865
the building.

1400
01:31:57,865 --> 01:32:05,713
MARISHA: Oh shit. Okay. I turn to Nott. I go--

1401
01:32:05,713 --> 01:32:07,532
SAM: Look at two unicorns inside?

1402
01:32:07,532 --> 01:32:10,030
MARISHA: The gnolls!

1403
01:32:10,030 --> 01:32:11,592
SAM: They're inside the--?

1404
01:32:11,592 --> 01:32:12,410
MARISHA: Shh.

1405
01:32:12,410 --> 01:32:14,455
MATT: I would like you all now to roll
initiative.

1406
01:32:14,455 --> 01:32:18,068
MARISHA: Natural 20.

1407
01:32:18,068 --> 01:32:20,689
ALL: Whoa.

1408
01:32:20,689 --> 01:32:23,298
MARISHA: That's the second one of the night.

1409
01:32:23,298 --> 01:32:25,262
SAM: Oh wait, is this an ability check?

1410
01:32:25,262 --> 01:32:27,756
MATT: Yes, so these are with disadvantage.

1411
01:32:27,756 --> 01:32:28,850
LAURA: Oh, really?

1412
01:32:28,850 --> 01:32:30,632
LIAM: Oh, scheiß.

1413
01:32:30,632 --> 01:32:33,672
MARISHA: No good?

1414
01:32:33,712 --> 01:32:34,861
LIAM: That was worse.

1415
01:32:34,861 --> 01:32:35,895
MARISHA: Oh no.

1416
01:32:35,895 --> 01:32:37,223
TRAVIS: (German accent) That was worse.

1417
01:32:37,223 --> 01:32:40,243
LIAM: That was already bad.

1418
01:32:40,243 --> 01:32:42,696
LAURA: Initiative is an ability?

1419
01:32:42,696 --> 01:32:44,187
MATT: It is.

1420
01:32:44,187 --> 01:32:45,523
LAURA: Are attack rolls?

1421
01:32:45,523 --> 01:32:46,722
SAM and MATT: No.

1422
01:32:46,722 --> 01:32:48,215
LAURA: Okay. Did I already ask that?

1423
01:32:48,215 --> 01:32:52,812
SAM: Nope. Don't worry, though; I touched all your
dice, so they're going to roll great tonight.

1424
01:32:52,812 --> 01:32:54,611
LAURA: Thanks. Thanks, Sam.

1425
01:32:54,611 --> 01:32:56,197
TALIESIN: He may have licked a couple of them.

1426
01:32:56,197 --> 01:32:58,397
LAURA: Can you lick this one?

1427
01:32:58,397 --> 01:33:01,581
MATT: 25 to 20, anybody?

1428
01:33:01,581 --> 01:33:03,432
TRAVIS: 25 to 20.

1429
01:33:03,432 --> 01:33:04,674
MARISHA: 24.

1430
01:33:04,674 --> 01:33:07,597
LAURA: I'm going to put it back over here. I'm
going to try it. Maybe it'll roll really well with

1431
01:33:07,597 --> 01:33:08,908
your spit on it.

1432
01:33:08,908 --> 01:33:10,266
TALIESIN: It's a very pretty die.

1433
01:33:10,266 --> 01:33:11,509
LAURA: It's so pretty, right?

1434
01:33:11,509 --> 01:33:13,170
MATT: 20 to 15?

1435
01:33:13,170 --> 01:33:14,764
TRAVIS: 16.

1436
01:33:14,764 --> 01:33:21,243
MATT: 16. All righty. 15 to ten?

1437
01:33:21,243 --> 01:33:24,773
TALIESIN: Nine. Oh, nope, never mind, yeah.

1438
01:33:24,773 --> 01:33:26,358
TRAVIS: Wow, guys. Wow.

1439
01:33:26,358 --> 01:33:27,561
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

1440
01:33:27,561 --> 01:33:29,138
MATT: All right, ten to five.

1441
01:33:29,138 --> 01:33:30,006
TALIESIN: Nine.

1442
01:33:30,006 --> 01:33:30,924
LAURA: Seven.

1443
01:33:30,924 --> 01:33:32,573
LIAM and SAM: Six.

1444
01:33:32,573 --> 01:33:34,014
MATT: Okay, so that order.

1445
01:33:34,014 --> 01:33:37,401
TALIESIN: I want them to get a little closer
anyway. They're all far.

1446
01:33:37,401 --> 01:33:39,087
LIAM: It's all part of the plan.

1447
01:33:39,087 --> 01:33:40,333
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

1448
01:33:40,333 --> 01:33:41,825
TALIESIN: It's going to go great.

1449
01:33:41,825 --> 01:33:45,452
MATT: Molly, then Jester. Then Caleb?

1450
01:33:45,452 --> 01:33:46,492
LIAM: Yeah.

1451
01:33:46,492 --> 01:33:47,697
SAM: And Nott.

1452
01:33:47,697 --> 01:33:48,662
LIAM: What'd you get?

1453
01:33:48,662 --> 01:33:49,585
SAM: Six.

1454
01:33:49,585 --> 01:33:51,199
LIAM: Oh, all together at last.

1455
01:33:51,199 --> 01:33:59,516
MATT: All righty, so. Top of the round, as some of
this has happened. The one gnoll skeletal form has

1456
01:33:59,516 --> 01:34:04,402
shattered onto the ground. Some of the other
gnolls begin to look over in that direction, and

1457
01:34:04,402 --> 01:34:09,924
see a few of you over by the guards now, standing
up and darting over the way. They're preparing for

1458
01:34:09,924 --> 01:34:14,321
some sort of... whatever's coming. But first of the
round is you, Beau.

1459
01:34:14,321 --> 01:34:16,522
MARISHA: I turn to Nott.

1460
01:34:16,522 --> 01:34:17,854
SAM: Huh!?

1461
01:34:17,854 --> 01:34:21,050
MARISHA: Hey, you want to take these guys? You
ready for this?

1462
01:34:21,050 --> 01:34:24,628
SAM: (panicked stuttering) I'm going to drink from
my flask.

1463
01:34:24,628 --> 01:34:30,278
MARISHA: Get ready. I want them to come to this
window, okay? I'm going to go (whistles) through

1464
01:34:30,278 --> 01:34:33,804
the window. Try and get their attention.

1465
01:34:33,804 --> 01:34:35,031
MATT: Okay.

1466
01:34:35,031 --> 01:34:36,062
LAURA: Right there?

1467
01:34:36,062 --> 01:34:37,452
MATT: Make a performance check.

1468
01:34:37,452 --> 01:34:45,480
MARISHA: To whistle? Not great. Not great at all.
Three.

1469
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:49,414
MATT: All right. The whistle has a bit of volume
to it. Unfortunately, with the sound of all the

1470
01:34:49,414 --> 01:34:53,326
breaking of furniture, them all growling at each
other, and the general screams in the vicinity,

1471
01:34:53,326 --> 01:34:58,047
it's lost in the chaos. It's not necessarily a
quiet atmosphere to draw a guard's attention. The

1472
01:34:58,047 --> 01:35:02,214
gnolls don't seem to care much for a whistle
around the window. They're more focused on

1473
01:35:02,214 --> 01:35:05,321
grabbing and running out the front, other way,
with whatever they're taking.

1474
01:35:05,321 --> 01:35:07,774
MARISHA: Is that my action or a bonus action?

1475
01:35:07,774 --> 01:35:10,422
MATT: I'll let that be like a bonus action, we'll
say.

1476
01:35:10,422 --> 01:35:11,765
MARISHA: Bonus action.

1477
01:35:11,765 --> 01:35:13,730
MATT: Because you were waiting for something to
happen.

1478
01:35:13,730 --> 01:35:14,826
LIAM: Mercer-ful.

1479
01:35:14,826 --> 01:35:23,601
MARISHA: Shit. Going in! I jump through the
window, and before one of them leaves, I'm going

1480
01:35:23,601 --> 01:35:26,221
to crack them with the staff right over the head.

1481
01:35:26,221 --> 01:35:30,352
MATT: Okay. With a 40-foot movement, that brings
you--

1482
01:35:30,352 --> 01:35:32,813
MARISHA: Can I go in through the window?

1483
01:35:32,813 --> 01:35:36,630
MATT: You do. As you go through the window,
because they've mostly shifted into the other room

1484
01:35:36,630 --> 01:35:39,487
now; that's where you see them moving. They're not
in the room that's closest to you, so you go jump

1485
01:35:39,487 --> 01:35:42,537
through the window, over the mass, make your way
through the living room, and you watch as they're

1486
01:35:42,537 --> 01:35:45,321
exiting the door. You get all the way through.

1487
01:35:45,321 --> 01:35:47,354
MARISHA: I thought it was much closer than that.

1488
01:35:47,354 --> 01:35:53,207
MATT: Unfortunately, no. But you do manage to make
it all the way to this door there.

1489
01:35:53,207 --> 01:35:56,766
MARISHA: Oh! They're going out the back door. I
thought they were going out that way!

1490
01:35:56,766 --> 01:35:58,011
MATT: Nope!

1491
01:35:58,011 --> 01:35:58,989
MARISHA: Okay.

1492
01:35:58,989 --> 01:36:01,033
MATT: Is that still what you want to do?

1493
01:36:01,033 --> 01:36:03,619
MARISHA: That's bad disadvantage. Fog of war.

1494
01:36:03,619 --> 01:36:07,802
MATT: Well, here's what you do. As you rush
through to go after them, as they're fleeing out

1495
01:36:07,802 --> 01:36:12,799
the other side, you come to the doorway and you
can see there's one gnoll right in front of you

1496
01:36:12,799 --> 01:36:18,176
that hasn't noticed you rushing behind it. It's
currently throwing a corpse of one of the

1497
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:23,705
villagers onto a cart that's sitting right outside
of that door. That cart, which is piled up with

1498
01:36:23,705 --> 01:36:27,902
other corpses, and bags, and whatever things they
were robbing from the inside of this building that

1499
01:36:27,902 --> 01:36:31,553
they've thrown onto this cart. You can now see
there's four gnolls that are gathered around it in

1500
01:36:31,553 --> 01:36:34,807
the process of throwing things onto it, and it
looks like they're getting ready to start pushing

1501
01:36:34,807 --> 01:36:38,247
it. They haven't noticed your arrival, as you've
just darted into the doorway. What are you going

1502
01:36:38,247 --> 01:36:39,483
to do?

1503
01:36:39,483 --> 01:36:47,053
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to double ba-- Ah, I can't
move anymore, can I?

1504
01:36:47,053 --> 01:36:48,959
MATT: No, that was your move to get there.

1505
01:36:48,959 --> 01:36:53,719
MARISHA: I'm going to spend a ki point and do
Patient Defense.

1506
01:36:53,719 --> 01:36:58,982
MATT: Well, as your action you can just go into it
without having to spend a ki point.

1507
01:36:59,025 --> 01:37:00,063
MARISHA: Oh, really?

1508
01:37:00,063 --> 01:37:02,920
MATT: Because you already used your bonus action.
The ki point allows you to do it as a bonus

1509
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:04,634
action, but you can just do it as an action any
time.

1510
01:37:04,634 --> 01:37:06,072
MARISHA: Ooh. Great, I'll do that.

1511
01:37:06,072 --> 01:37:07,230
MATT: You just go into the dodge action.

1512
01:37:07,230 --> 01:37:09,168
MARISHA: I'll just hold back and wait.

1513
01:37:09,168 --> 01:37:11,951
MATT: Right, so you're holding back in the
doorway, and you're ready to use the door to help

1514
01:37:11,951 --> 01:37:15,116
defend you if it needs to. Okay, that ends Beau's
turn. It's now their turn.

1515
01:37:15,116 --> 01:37:17,443
TRAVIS: Oh, shit, already? Oh god.

1516
01:37:17,443 --> 01:37:20,190
TALIESIN: Yeah, this is what was coming.

1517
01:37:20,190 --> 01:37:21,762
MATT: They rolled really high in the initiative.

1518
01:37:21,762 --> 01:37:23,180
TRAVIS: What are we calling these things?

1519
01:37:23,180 --> 01:37:24,053
ALL: Gnolls.

1520
01:37:24,053 --> 01:37:25,129
LIAM: G-N-O-L-L.

1521
01:37:25,129 --> 01:37:28,928
MARISHA: I thought I was going to still be a lot
closer to Nott.

1522
01:37:28,928 --> 01:37:30,471
LIAM: (sings) G-N-O-L-L.

1523
01:37:30,471 --> 01:37:31,977
LAURA: (sings) K-N-O-L-L

1524
01:37:31,977 --> 01:37:34,286
MATT: Visibly off to the side, there is...

1525
01:37:34,286 --> 01:37:36,704
SAM: N-O-L-L?

1526
01:37:36,704 --> 01:37:41,044
MATT: Yeah, that's going to be two of them firing
their bow-- Actually, no, three, because they

1527
01:37:41,044 --> 01:37:44,162
watched you come out. There's three of them that
are going to be firing their bows at Beau.

1528
01:37:44,162 --> 01:37:45,670
LAURA: Oh no!

1529
01:37:45,670 --> 01:37:48,341
SAM: Beau, bow, Beau, and bow?

1530
01:37:48,341 --> 01:37:50,836
LIAM: Bobobo-bo bo-bobo.

1531
01:37:50,836 --> 01:37:53,263
MATT: They all have disadvantage on the attack,
however.

1532
01:37:53,263 --> 01:37:54,981
SAM: She's in Patient Defense; she's going to be
fine.

1533
01:37:54,981 --> 01:38:00,514
MATT: As this one fires off in the direction of
your duplicitous form, as it disappears through.

1534
01:38:00,514 --> 01:38:06,326
As it's the only thing it can visually see. It's
going to stay behind the wall. That's three

1535
01:38:06,326 --> 01:38:08,179
attacks at disadvantage against Beau.

1536
01:38:08,179 --> 01:38:09,496
MARISHA: And they all have disadvantage.

1537
01:38:09,496 --> 01:38:10,401
MATT: They do.

1538
01:38:10,401 --> 01:38:11,672
MARISHA: Because I did Patient Defense?

1539
01:38:11,672 --> 01:38:12,998
SAM: You're going to be fine.

1540
01:38:12,998 --> 01:38:17,165
MATT: First one with a longbow, that's a 15?

1541
01:38:17,165 --> 01:38:18,328
MARISHA: Miss.

1542
01:38:18,328 --> 01:38:23,666
MATT: Right. Misses. The first one, you watch as
it just moves past you and slams into the door.

1543
01:38:23,666 --> 01:38:25,714
The next one, from this guy up here--

1544
01:38:25,714 --> 01:38:28,614
MARISHA: I immediately go: whoops.

1545
01:38:28,614 --> 01:38:35,592
MATT: That's a 12 and a two. The other one misses
into the wall. This one over here is going to fire

1546
01:38:35,592 --> 01:38:42,119
at you. That's a 16 and a 14, plus three, 17.

1547
01:38:42,119 --> 01:38:45,009
MARISHA: 17 is my armor class.

1548
01:38:45,009 --> 01:38:48,613
MATT: The first two: one hits the door; the other
one, you duck out of the way; and the third one

1549
01:38:48,613 --> 01:39:00,036
comes and it's piercing right towards your chest.
It's going to deal 2d8, seven points of piercing damage.

1550
01:39:00,036 --> 01:39:03,161
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to use Deflect Missiles
for my reaction.

1551
01:39:03,161 --> 01:39:06,356
MATT: Oh, right! Because you got that for your--
Okay. As a reaction, you watch this one arrow that

1552
01:39:06,356 --> 01:39:07,667
you can't quite duck out of the way--

1553
01:39:07,667 --> 01:39:09,441
MARISHA: (grunting exertions)

1554
01:39:09,441 --> 01:39:10,824
MATT: All right. So go ahead and make the roll.

1555
01:39:10,824 --> 01:39:14,291
MARISHA: But it's not super-- I'm still level
three, so it's more like a cat swat.

1556
01:39:14,291 --> 01:39:17,034
MATT: Yeah, you're trying to swat it and see if
you can carry the momentum with it.

1557
01:39:17,034 --> 01:39:18,398
LAURA: 20!

1558
01:39:18,398 --> 01:39:23,367
MARISHA: That is seven on the dice, plus seven,
14.

1559
01:39:23,367 --> 01:39:25,238
MATT: You reduce the damage to zero and you catch
it.

1560
01:39:25,238 --> 01:39:27,105
SAM: Whoa.

1561
01:39:27,105 --> 01:39:30,477
MATT: If you want to, you can spend a ki point to
throw it, if you want to.

1562
01:39:30,477 --> 01:39:31,826
TRAVIS: Oh! Throw that shit!

1563
01:39:31,826 --> 01:39:33,428
MARISHA: Yeah, let's do it! Just because I can!

1564
01:39:33,428 --> 01:39:34,705
MATT: All right, where are you throwing it to?

1565
01:39:34,705 --> 01:39:37,077
TRAVIS: In the foot.

1566
01:39:37,077 --> 01:39:38,594
LIAM: At the bitch who attacked you.

1567
01:39:38,594 --> 01:39:39,671
SAM: Or the guy in front of you.

1568
01:39:39,671 --> 01:39:43,651
MARISHA: I'm going to do it at the guy in front of
me, who's right behind me.

1569
01:39:43,651 --> 01:39:44,787
MATT: Okay.

1570
01:39:44,787 --> 01:39:47,748
MARISHA: So I'm going to catch it, and I'm going
to spin around in a full flourish, and I'm going

1571
01:39:47,748 --> 01:39:51,327
to just throw it like a Gambit card with the
momentum that it's got.

1572
01:39:51,327 --> 01:39:55,603
MATT: All right, so as you grab it, you spin
around and throw it. Go ahead and make the attack roll.

1573
01:39:55,603 --> 01:39:57,547
MARISHA: What's the attack roll?

1574
01:39:57,547 --> 01:39:59,090
MATT: It should be your--

1575
01:39:59,090 --> 01:40:01,084
MARISHA: What is it? I've never done this before!

1576
01:40:01,084 --> 01:40:02,312
MATT: I know. This is new.

1577
01:40:02,312 --> 01:40:03,719
MARISHA: It's brand new!

1578
01:40:03,719 --> 01:40:15,310
MATT: Here we go. You just make a ranged attack
with it, so roll a d20, add your dexterity modifier

1579
01:40:15,310 --> 01:40:19,907
and your proficiency modifier, so same as any of
your other attacks, because it counts as a monk weapon.

1580
01:40:19,907 --> 01:40:21,466
MARISHA: Okay, 16.

1581
01:40:21,466 --> 01:40:25,530
MATT: 16 hits. It takes 1d8, so roll 1d8, plus
two.

1582
01:40:25,530 --> 01:40:29,517
MARISHA: Four. Four damage total.

1583
01:40:29,517 --> 01:40:34,885
MATT: All right. I wonder, does it add your damage
bonus to it, or the original weapon, because it is

1584
01:40:34,885 --> 01:40:38,288
your strength throwing it back. Pardon me, folks,
while we're figuring out new abilities they can use.

1585
01:40:38,288 --> 01:40:42,898
MARISHA: You make the attack with proficiency and
the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack.

1586
01:40:42,898 --> 01:40:44,817
MATT: It is your attack, so you get to add your
dex bonus.

1587
01:40:44,817 --> 01:40:46,649
MARISHA: So six total.

1588
01:40:46,649 --> 01:40:54,382
MATT: All right, so six points of damage. You
watch as the arrow just sinks into the chest of

1589
01:40:54,382 --> 01:40:57,955
its thick hide armor. (snarling)

1590
01:40:57,955 --> 01:41:01,687
MARISHA: I go: Hah! Ooh.

1591
01:41:01,687 --> 01:41:06,439
MATT: The other ones that are throwing stuff onto
the cart hear this commotion and turn around and

1592
01:41:06,439 --> 01:41:10,019
look at you. Three of them continue just throwing
stuff onto the cart faster, while the one that's

1593
01:41:10,019 --> 01:41:15,993
immediately in front of you spins around and
stands tall. You can see it looking down at you a full

1594
01:41:15,993 --> 01:41:22,018
foot and a half, almost two feet taller than you.
(snarling) It's going to go ahead and grabs a

1595
01:41:22,018 --> 01:41:26,132
spear off the side of the wall that it had leaning
against and it's going to try to thrust it at you.

1596
01:41:26,132 --> 01:41:33,671
It still has disadvantage on the attack, though,
because you're in your stance. That's 16.

1597
01:41:33,671 --> 01:41:34,846
MARISHA: Miss.

1598
01:41:34,846 --> 01:41:39,310
MATT: This one, as it goes and thrusts with the
spear, coming off of the adrenaline of the

1599
01:41:39,310 --> 01:41:44,538
deflected missile, you duck low, and then kick the
spear up, which slams into the top of the door frame

1600
01:41:44,538 --> 01:41:48,815
and completely misses you. He's now stepping into
the door frame, completely filling it as you're

1601
01:41:48,815 --> 01:41:53,767
backing up into your space, and the two of you are
in this very intense, small, occupied block.

1602
01:41:53,767 --> 01:41:57,118
MARISHA: And I go: no, seriously dude, did you see
that?!

1603
01:41:57,118 --> 01:41:59,952
TRAVIS: My legs are jumping around like crazy
right now.

1604
01:41:59,952 --> 01:42:09,915
MATT: These guys are going to begin pushing the
cart and it's going to move at half their movement

1605
01:42:09,915 --> 01:42:23,708
to there. This one here is going to move up to
here, right around the side of this wall, and it's

1606
01:42:23,708 --> 01:42:28,299
going to take its longbow and fire at you,
because you're the one they can see.

1607
01:42:28,299 --> 01:42:29,953
MARISHA: That's fair.

1608
01:42:29,953 --> 01:42:31,637
MATT: Disadvantage. That is a 15.

1609
01:42:31,637 --> 01:42:32,728
MARISHA: Miss.

1610
01:42:32,728 --> 01:42:37,016
MATT: This one, actually, you see over at the
fire, and you grab the front of the armor of the

1611
01:42:37,016 --> 01:42:42,693
gnoll and pull his in front of you, and it actually
hits the back of his armor, splintering it, and

1612
01:42:42,693 --> 01:42:43,977
the smell hits you.

1613
01:42:43,977 --> 01:42:45,710
MARISHA: I just go, excuse me for a second. Thank
you.

1614
01:42:45,710 --> 01:42:52,187
MATT: As you let him go, there's this thick, oily,
horrible liquid that's matted in the fur, and the

1615
01:42:52,187 --> 01:43:02,916
touch of it's nasty. The smell itself is very
acrid of rotting flesh and mangy fur. That's going

1616
01:43:02,916 --> 01:43:06,537
to end all those guys there, they're pushing
there. All right, that ends the gnolls' turn.

1617
01:43:06,537 --> 01:43:08,392
Fjord, you're up.

1618
01:43:08,392 --> 01:43:16,578
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay. With my 30 feet of movement,
can I wrap around the far side of the house and

1619
01:43:16,578 --> 01:43:18,417
just get to cover of the corner?

1620
01:43:18,417 --> 01:43:19,908
MATT: That's exactly where you can get.

1621
01:43:19,908 --> 01:43:22,350
TRAVIS: Now there is an individual over there that
sucks, right?

1622
01:43:22,350 --> 01:43:26,340
MATT: Correct. You see it has a longbow and is
currently reaching back and it's pulling another

1623
01:43:26,340 --> 01:43:28,369
arrow and getting it notched up.

1624
01:43:28,369 --> 01:43:31,845
TRAVIS: I beg for forgiveness, I'm going to try
some shit. I would like to cast--

1625
01:43:31,845 --> 01:43:33,632
MARISHA: We're all trying some shit, it's okay.

1626
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:35,181
TRAVIS: Crown of Madness.

1627
01:43:35,181 --> 01:43:37,336
(cheering)

1628
01:43:37,336 --> 01:43:39,764
MATT: All righty, so what's the save on that one?

1629
01:43:39,764 --> 01:43:48,597
TRAVIS: It is wisdom saving throw, I believe, let
me double-check. Yeah, wisdom saving throw.

1630
01:43:48,597 --> 01:43:53,048
MATT: No, that's an eight. I'm pretty sure that
does not hit.

1631
01:43:53,048 --> 01:44:00,333
TRAVIS: So he becomes charmed, and a jagged crown
of iron appears around his head, and madness glows

1632
01:44:00,333 --> 01:44:01,684
in its eye.

1633
01:44:01,684 --> 01:44:03,340
MATT: That's concentration, correct?

1634
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:04,376
TRAVIS: Yes, it is.

1635
01:44:04,376 --> 01:44:10,607
MATT: I'm putting a concentration circle on you.
All righty, the charmed target must use its action

1636
01:44:10,607 --> 01:44:13,588
before moving each of its turns to make a melee
attack against a creature other than itself you

1637
01:44:13,588 --> 01:44:16,970
mentally choose. So it has to be a melee attack.

1638
01:44:16,970 --> 01:44:21,787
TRAVIS: Oh, melee. Fucking shit, I saw the bows.
Damn the words in this book!

1639
01:44:21,787 --> 01:44:22,927
MATT: That's okay.

1640
01:44:22,927 --> 01:44:25,439
(laughter)

1641
01:44:25,439 --> 01:44:28,386
TRAVIS: But I can make him move towards something,
right?

1642
01:44:28,386 --> 01:44:29,409
MATT: That you can.

1643
01:44:29,409 --> 01:44:33,104
TRAVIS: Okay, good. I'm going to have him climb up
on that roof and attack that other fucking gnoll

1644
01:44:33,104 --> 01:44:34,755
that's up on that son of a bitch.

1645
01:44:34,755 --> 01:44:40,011
MATT: Okay. Since it has to use its action before
its movement, you watch as it looks up at the top

1646
01:44:40,011 --> 01:44:45,976
of the roof, (snarling) and leaps up, climbs,
scampers up to the side, and gets right up into

1647
01:44:45,976 --> 01:44:49,881
base to base with this guy, confusing the other
gnoll, who looks down at it, like it's about to

1648
01:44:49,881 --> 01:44:53,060
help him, and it doesn't seem to notice there's
any sort of threat there, but it can't make an

1649
01:44:53,060 --> 01:44:54,506
attack on this round.

1650
01:44:54,506 --> 01:44:59,149
TRAVIS: That's fair. Can I use my bonus action to
use my Mask of Many Faces to make myself look like

1651
01:44:59,149 --> 01:45:01,341
a gnoll? No, they're taller. They're too tall.

1652
01:45:01,341 --> 01:45:04,765
MATT: Well, they're medium, they're not--

1653
01:45:04,765 --> 01:45:07,009
TRAVIS: Two feet taller, I can only do a foot
taller or shorter.

1654
01:45:07,009 --> 01:45:09,873
MATT: It's cutting it close, you'd look like a
small gnoll.

1655
01:45:09,873 --> 01:45:11,630
TRAVIS: I'd like to do it.

1656
01:45:11,630 --> 01:45:13,029
LAURA: A teeny gnoll.

1657
01:45:13,029 --> 01:45:16,271
MARISHA: He's the runt.

1658
01:45:16,271 --> 01:45:22,096
MATT: You are visible to a number of gnolls in
this courtyard. You don't have any movement to

1659
01:45:22,096 --> 01:45:24,110
back away from that edge, unfortunately.

1660
01:45:24,110 --> 01:45:27,964
TRAVIS: I was hoping to just be-- Because I can't
see that far-- to be right here to hit the only

1661
01:45:27,964 --> 01:45:29,461
guy that could see me on the ground there.

1662
01:45:29,461 --> 01:45:34,342
MATT: Right, but you're right on the corner,
that's how you were able to see him and send him

1663
01:45:34,342 --> 01:45:35,581
this way.

1664
01:45:35,581 --> 01:45:37,123
TRAVIS: The guy on the roof can see me as well?

1665
01:45:37,123 --> 01:45:41,106
MATT: Yeah, they can both see you. Just so you
know. The rest of them probably can't, but you

1666
01:45:41,106 --> 01:45:46,101
transform yourself into a gnoll-like appearance.
All right. Does that end your turn?

1667
01:45:46,101 --> 01:45:47,291
TRAVIS: That is it.

1668
01:45:47,291 --> 01:45:54,477
MATT: All righty. In the back of the alleyway, one
of the gnolls stands thicker, more angry, and more

1669
01:45:54,477 --> 01:46:02,183
ornate than the rest of the pack. You see heavy
scale mail armor across the torso, and a large

1670
01:46:02,183 --> 01:46:09,500
helmet across its head. You look as thick spines
about a foot and a half to two feet long are woven

1671
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:14,108
into the scales themselves off the shoulders, the
back of the helmet, and the sides of the armor.

1672
01:46:14,108 --> 01:46:22,336
They look natural, as opposed to metal, like long,
bony spines that are put onto it, both as an

1673
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:30,693
ornate adornment, or possibly just a means of
defense and to look scary. It begins barking and

1674
01:46:30,693 --> 01:46:34,709
steps forward, giving motions to some of the other
gnolls, and the ones that are on the cart continue

1675
01:46:34,709 --> 01:46:36,326
pushing it, as it steps forward--

1676
01:46:36,326 --> 01:46:39,595
LAURA: Oh no.

1677
01:46:39,595 --> 01:46:40,937
MATT: To there.

1678
01:46:40,937 --> 01:46:43,292
TRAVIS: I should have used it on that fucker.

1679
01:46:43,292 --> 01:46:46,502
MATT: It's going to go ahead and use--

1680
01:46:46,502 --> 01:46:48,973
SAM: Is that a crownsguard?

1681
01:46:48,973 --> 01:46:52,507
LAURA: No, he's like a Grandmaster gnoll.

1682
01:46:52,507 --> 01:46:53,891
SAM: No, the guy next to him.

1683
01:46:53,891 --> 01:46:57,902
LAURA: Oh. I feel like that's a zombie gnoll.

1684
01:46:57,902 --> 01:46:59,871
MATT: It's going to use Incite Rampage.

1685
01:46:59,871 --> 01:47:01,791
SAM: Oof, what does that mean?

1686
01:47:01,791 --> 01:47:08,871
MATT: It looks over towards the one that's right
next to Beau and goes, (snarling). The one that's

1687
01:47:08,871 --> 01:47:12,978
in the middle of the area with you hears that,
grins, and then gets an extra attack against you,

1688
01:47:12,978 --> 01:47:21,147
with disadvantage. And a four. That defense is
helping you out. It goes to strike again, and as

1689
01:47:21,147 --> 01:47:24,350
it comes out with its claw, it's putting its spear
to the side.

1690
01:47:24,350 --> 01:47:26,198
MARISHA: I do a little duck.

1691
01:47:26,198 --> 01:47:32,713
MATT: It misses you entirely. That's going to end
its turn at the moment. Then it goes to the guards

1692
01:47:32,713 --> 01:47:35,184
on this end. These guards are going to fan out.

1693
01:47:35,184 --> 01:47:37,426
TRAVIS: (raspy voice) Hey, come on, let's go.

1694
01:47:37,426 --> 01:47:45,888
MATT: Then they dart back around this way. They're
going to find a corner next to you, Jester, and

1695
01:47:45,888 --> 01:47:52,835
take a shot at the gnoll that's up on the roof,
next to the one that you have charmed. Shit,

1696
01:47:52,835 --> 01:47:58,717
that's going to miss. Five plus five. He fires and
it goes wide, you see it vanish into the rising

1697
01:47:58,717 --> 01:48:04,262
cloud of embers and flame. That's going to end the
guards' turn. They're getting around and preparing

1698
01:48:04,262 --> 01:48:05,629
for the next round to shoot a volley.

1699
01:48:05,629 --> 01:48:08,137
LAURA: I pat him on the shoulder and say: don't
worry, nobody saw that.

1700
01:48:08,137 --> 01:48:13,558
MATT: They glance over their shoulder and is like,
"Shh!" Molly, you're up.

1701
01:48:13,558 --> 01:48:21,216
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a run. Am I going to
do this? Am I going to be this idiot? Yeah, let's

1702
01:48:21,216 --> 01:48:27,041
be an idiot. I'm going to take a run to try to get
cover at the other house. I'm going to try to run

1703
01:48:27,041 --> 01:48:27,965
across the alleyway.

1704
01:48:27,965 --> 01:48:28,991
MATT: This way?

1705
01:48:28,991 --> 01:48:29,772
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1706
01:48:29,772 --> 01:48:30,760
LAURA: Dashy-dash?

1707
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:32,035
TALIESIN: Dashy-dash.

1708
01:48:32,035 --> 01:48:38,065
MATT: (counting) It will put you at about there.

1709
01:48:38,065 --> 01:48:39,143
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1710
01:48:39,143 --> 01:48:40,304
MATT: But that's your round.

1711
01:48:40,304 --> 01:48:41,812
TALIESIN: That's my round. I just (zooming).

1712
01:48:41,812 --> 01:48:46,696
MATT: Cool. All righty. That ends Molly's turn.
Jester, you're up.

1713
01:48:46,696 --> 01:49:00,884
LAURA: Okie dokie. I'm going to send my duplicate
out against the wall on this house.

1714
01:49:00,884 --> 01:49:02,991
MATT: Over here?

1715
01:49:02,991 --> 01:49:14,860
LAURA: Yeah. Against that wall. She can go up to
30 feet. And I'm going to run across--

1716
01:49:14,860 --> 01:49:16,263
MATT: That space?

1717
01:49:16,263 --> 01:49:22,796
LAURA: Yeah, can I get against the wall further
in? Yeah, right there, that's good.

1718
01:49:22,796 --> 01:49:26,408
MATT: Okay. That's your turn? You still have an
action.

1719
01:49:26,408 --> 01:49:28,693
LAURA: Oh yeah, I'm going to use my bonus
action--

1720
01:49:28,693 --> 01:49:34,334
MATT: You currently cannot see anything for it to
attack. You need to be able to see a target for it

1721
01:49:34,334 --> 01:49:41,186
to attack something. So you'd have to be either
further out. You can do it as part of your

1722
01:49:41,186 --> 01:49:43,786
movement, as you run across, make it move and
attack, and then continue back--

1723
01:49:43,786 --> 01:49:48,480
LAURA: As I'm running, can I use my spiritual
weapon and--

1724
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:50,167
MATT: Can you move it 20 feet?

1725
01:49:50,167 --> 01:50:00,092
LAURA: I think it's 30 feet. Let's see. 20 feet.
You're right, I'm sorry. 20 feet.

1726
01:50:00,092 --> 01:50:01,778
MATT: Which direction?

1727
01:50:01,778 --> 01:50:06,350
LAURA: Towards the giant guy and hit him!

1728
01:50:06,350 --> 01:50:08,057
MATT: Make a roll.

1729
01:50:08,057 --> 01:50:12,754
LAURA: Hit him with the rock! 15.

1730
01:50:12,754 --> 01:50:15,001
MATT: 15 unfortunately does not hit.

1731
01:50:15,001 --> 01:50:16,456
LAURA: Boo!

1732
01:50:16,456 --> 01:50:25,576
MATT: It just misses, you watch as the shield
comes up and deflects the large glowing mace of a

1733
01:50:25,576 --> 01:50:31,451
lollipop. Then you continue the rest of your
movement to dart behind the building. At this

1734
01:50:31,451 --> 01:50:35,025
point, you've all pretty much shown your cards
that you're here and part of this fight. You're

1735
01:50:35,025 --> 01:50:36,684
the only one who's up in the air.

1736
01:50:36,684 --> 01:50:43,023
LAURA: For my action, can I still see my duplicate
around the corner right there?

1737
01:50:43,023 --> 01:50:44,142
MATT: Correct.

1738
01:50:44,142 --> 01:50:45,492
LAURA: She is going to cast--

1739
01:50:45,492 --> 01:50:48,585
MATT: Well, you would be able to as you're
running.

1740
01:50:48,585 --> 01:50:54,275
LAURA: Okay. She is going to use the cantrip
Sacred Flame!

1741
01:50:54,275 --> 01:50:55,971
MATT: Against?

1742
01:50:55,971 --> 01:50:58,716
LAURA: Against the same big guy!

1743
01:50:58,716 --> 01:51:02,502
MATT: These would be things you would have done before you
ran across.

1744
01:51:02,502 --> 01:51:05,638
LAURA: Yes, basically yes, that's what I did.
Technically I did this before I moved.

1745
01:51:05,638 --> 01:51:13,585
MATT: Just letting you know that usually you have
to do that as part of your movement. Dexterity

1746
01:51:13,585 --> 01:51:17,951
saving throw. That is a 12.

1747
01:51:17,951 --> 01:51:23,689
LAURA: Good! He has to beat 13! It hits him!

1748
01:51:23,689 --> 01:51:25,690
MATT: It takes 1d8 points of radiant damage.

1749
01:51:25,690 --> 01:51:30,199
LAURA: Yes it does! Four.

1750
01:51:30,199 --> 01:51:40,523
MATT: After the shield deflects the lollipop, the
flash of radiant energy burns across the armor and

1751
01:51:40,523 --> 01:51:43,738
the torso. Instinctively it puts up the shield to
try and deflect the blow from the eyes.

1752
01:51:43,738 --> 01:51:51,289
(screeches) Looks out and doesn't see where it
came from, but it's singed a little. That ends

1753
01:51:51,289 --> 01:51:55,083
Jester's turn, Caleb and Nott, you're up.

1754
01:51:55,083 --> 01:51:59,990
LIAM: Yeah okay, I will move along the table over
here to this spot.

1755
01:51:59,990 --> 01:52:02,079
LAURA: Well, that's one method to be able to
reach.

1756
01:52:02,079 --> 01:52:04,358
LIAM: I think I have a clear view of the big gnoll,
correct? From there?

1757
01:52:04,358 --> 01:52:07,561
MATT: The big one? You do.

1758
01:52:07,561 --> 01:52:15,452
LIAM: I mutter a few arcane words under my breath
and a circle of flame spins around my hand and

1759
01:52:15,452 --> 01:52:26,190
three beams of fire shoot out towards this big
guy. I cast Scorching Ray. Each one is a separate

1760
01:52:26,190 --> 01:52:31,644
attack. First one is a 16.

1761
01:52:31,644 --> 01:52:33,261
MATT: 16 hits.

1762
01:52:33,261 --> 01:52:36,328
LIAM: Second one is also a 16, the third one is a
17.

1763
01:52:36,328 --> 01:52:37,715
MATT: All three hit.

1764
01:52:37,715 --> 01:52:39,422
LIAM: So 6d6 on him.

1765
01:52:39,422 --> 01:52:40,927
SAM: 6d6?

1766
01:52:40,927 --> 01:52:44,536
LIAM: Because they all hit. That's four, six--

1767
01:52:44,536 --> 01:52:47,392
TRAVIS: What dice are you rolling there, big guy?

1768
01:52:47,392 --> 01:52:48,994
LIAM: Nine. That's the six?

1769
01:52:48,994 --> 01:52:50,594
TRAVIS: No, your d20, which one was it?

1770
01:52:50,594 --> 01:52:51,777
LIAM: This one.

1771
01:52:51,777 --> 01:52:52,988
LAURA: That's the Grog one.

1772
01:52:52,988 --> 01:53:03,328
LIAM: Oh, thank you. (counting) That's a total of
19 fire damage on him.

1773
01:53:03,328 --> 01:53:10,608
MATT: 19 points of fire damage. As the three beams
arc out and blast, you see as the large gnoll, who

1774
01:53:10,608 --> 01:53:16,664
seems to be a pack lord or leader of some kind,
sees this coming. Tries to put the shield up, but

1775
01:53:16,664 --> 01:53:21,934
all three blast into its armor. You watch as
flames burn out of it suddenly. As it withdraws

1776
01:53:21,934 --> 01:53:30,293
and takes a step back-- (grows and howls) It just
looks angry. It looks hurt a little bit, but

1777
01:53:30,293 --> 01:53:31,263
mostly angry.

1778
01:53:31,263 --> 01:53:35,118
LIAM: I probably have ten feet of movement which I
would like to use to move back to where I was and

1779
01:53:35,118 --> 01:53:37,756
try to not hyperventilate against the back of this
building.

1780
01:53:37,756 --> 01:53:38,988
MATT: Okay.

1781
01:53:38,988 --> 01:53:42,739
LIAM: Dead center. Yeah. Okay. Good.

1782
01:53:42,739 --> 01:53:45,062
MATT: Good to know.

1783
01:53:45,062 --> 01:53:47,603
LAURA: I like that you're facing the wall so it
looks like--

1784
01:53:47,603 --> 01:53:52,765
LIAM: No, I'm like this. I'm doing this.

1785
01:53:52,765 --> 01:53:54,681
MATT: Nott, you're up.

1786
01:53:54,681 --> 01:54:04,327
SAM: Nott's going to poke her head into the window
where Beau is inside. Beau is within a few feet of

1787
01:54:04,327 --> 01:54:21,962
a baddie, right? I'm going to shoot the baddie
next to Beau. 15.

1788
01:54:21,962 --> 01:54:26,748
MATT: 15, that doesn't-- oh wait, for a regular
gnoll that just hits, barely.

1789
01:54:26,748 --> 01:54:28,589
ALL: Regular gnoll!

1790
01:54:28,589 --> 01:54:36,125
(laughter)

1791
01:54:36,125 --> 01:54:39,688
TRAVIS: That's all I heard!

1792
01:54:39,688 --> 01:54:47,885
SAM: Nine points, that's including sneak attack
damage. Plus fury of the small, so 11 points of damage.

1793
01:54:47,885 --> 01:54:51,399
MATT: Well, it's your level, right? You went up a
level so technically--

1794
01:54:51,399 --> 01:54:56,659
SAM: Ten points of-- wait, what did I say? Nine?
12! Thank you.

1795
01:54:56,659 --> 01:55:02,097
MATT: 12 points of damage. As this gnoll is in the
process of slamming through the front doorway, the

1796
01:55:02,097 --> 01:55:06,945
doorway has been bashed inward on each side and
Beau is in the process of dodging and weaving and

1797
01:55:06,945 --> 01:55:10,615
getting out of the way. You find one opening and
fire your crossbow bolt. It goes through the

1798
01:55:10,615 --> 01:55:15,235
window, through the doorway bisecting the two
different rooms and straight under the clavicle

1799
01:55:15,235 --> 01:55:22,233
near the heart section of it. As it pierces in,
(screams) and it coughs up a bunch of blood onto

1800
01:55:22,233 --> 01:55:28,702
the front of its hide armor. It's not dead, but
it's pretty hurt. That was a pretty nasty blow.

1801
01:55:28,702 --> 01:55:39,025
SAM: Movement, I will use to climb up into the
second floor window. That's not me. The one next

1802
01:55:39,025 --> 01:55:40,713
to your right. There you go.

1803
01:55:40,713 --> 01:55:43,158
MATT: Go ahead and make an athletics check.

1804
01:55:43,158 --> 01:55:53,438
SAM: That was good, but it's disadvantage. That's
better. Athletics. It's a straight ten.

1805
01:55:53,438 --> 01:55:57,578
MATT: Ten is exactly what you needed. That was the
DC to get up onto the second floor. As you come up

1806
01:55:57,578 --> 01:56:02,188
into the second floor, you immediately climb and
leap up through the window into a chamber that is

1807
01:56:02,188 --> 01:56:03,826
filled with roaring flame.

1808
01:56:03,826 --> 01:56:05,145
SAM: (screams)

1809
01:56:05,145 --> 01:56:11,217
MATT: Trying to avert your gaze, the heat is
pressing into you. There's a table that's on fire,

1810
01:56:11,217 --> 01:56:16,782
most of the roof has been burned away. There's
beams that have fallen. You're like, "This was a

1811
01:56:16,782 --> 01:56:18,013
"bad idea!"

1812
01:56:18,013 --> 01:56:20,245
SAM: I say: This is fine!

1813
01:56:20,245 --> 01:56:28,964
(laughter)

1814
01:56:28,964 --> 01:56:31,437
SAM: Can I use my dash? Was that all my movement?

1815
01:56:31,437 --> 01:56:35,307
MATT: No, that was your movement to get up there
and you could use your bonus action if you'd like to.

1816
01:56:35,307 --> 01:56:39,167
SAM: Okay, I'll use a bonus action to get-- Is
towards the window less fiery?

1817
01:56:39,167 --> 01:56:43,237
MATT: It's still burning, but you're going to have
to leap over the flames to get there.

1818
01:56:43,237 --> 01:56:45,432
SAM: Sure.

1819
01:56:45,432 --> 01:56:49,636
MATT: I'll say make an acrobatics check to try and
leap over parts of broken--

1820
01:56:49,636 --> 01:56:53,923
SAM: It was two threes.

1821
01:56:53,923 --> 01:57:01,707
MATT: You make it across. You leap onto the first
beam and it breaks. You're like "Ah, that burns!"

1822
01:57:01,707 --> 01:57:06,635
You leap again onto the next one, "Ah, that burns
too!" Eventually, you get over there. Your boots

1823
01:57:06,635 --> 01:57:15,194
are on fire, and you're having to pat them out
real fast. You suffer five points of fire damage

1824
01:57:15,194 --> 01:57:16,950
getting across the room.

1825
01:57:16,950 --> 01:57:18,166
SAM: Rough.

1826
01:57:18,166 --> 01:57:21,658
MATT: But you are in an area where it seems it's
just embers, and most of the flame is catching

1827
01:57:21,658 --> 01:57:26,772
behind you for the moment. You get the sense that
it might begin to spread in the next minute or so,

1828
01:57:26,772 --> 01:57:31,382
but at this point, you're not immediately in the
threat of flame and you have a look down into the

1829
01:57:31,382 --> 01:57:35,463
entirety of the courtyard with a little bit of
cover. In fact, it would be considered half cover

1830
01:57:35,463 --> 01:57:36,686
up in here.

1831
01:57:36,686 --> 01:57:41,946
SAM: Half cover. I'm done. Hey, look at that, it's
me in the window.

1832
01:57:41,946 --> 01:57:51,178
MATT: At which point, you can see the skeletal
gnolls that are out there all at once turn and

1833
01:57:51,178 --> 01:58:00,561
begin shambling forward. There's one this way that
begins to run up and take a swing at your

1834
01:58:00,561 --> 01:58:08,643
duplicitous form, before striking out with no
effect. This one spins and comes up into Beau and

1835
01:58:08,643 --> 01:58:11,355
then there's one that emerges from--

1836
01:58:11,355 --> 01:58:18,473
LAURA: I'm going to point out I've been doing
it wrong because I was thinking of my duplicate as

1837
01:58:18,473 --> 01:58:24,965
like Trinket was, which had movement the same as
me, and it is a bonus action to move my duplicate,

1838
01:58:24,965 --> 01:58:30,725
which I did not realize. I'm going to stop doing
that.

1839
01:58:30,725 --> 01:58:32,959
MATT: That's okay, we learn what the new abilities
do.

1840
01:58:32,959 --> 01:58:34,781
LAURA: Yeah, I just looked it up and I'm sorry.

1841
01:58:34,781 --> 01:58:36,114
MATT: That's all good.

1842
01:58:36,114 --> 01:58:40,649
SAM: So your duplicate is somehow less useful than
Trinket? Is that what you're saying?

1843
01:58:40,649 --> 01:58:46,324
(laughter)

1844
01:58:46,324 --> 01:58:48,575
LIAM: She doesn't give a shit about that bear.

1845
01:58:48,575 --> 01:58:58,681
MATT: Out of the doorway here, another one of them
bursts through and runs to the back and sees the

1846
01:58:58,681 --> 01:59:01,104
direction where Jester is in the process of
glancing over to the side.

1847
01:59:01,104 --> 01:59:02,556
LAURA: Oh! That's real me!

1848
01:59:02,556 --> 01:59:06,444
MATT: It uses its action to charge up into combat
with you. It can't actually make an attack this

1849
01:59:06,444 --> 01:59:12,672
turn, but it's right up to you. Its gaping,
vacuous skull, open sockets, trying to bear down

1850
01:59:12,672 --> 01:59:17,346
on you. That's going to end their go, except for
the one that's striking at you, Beau.

1851
01:59:17,346 --> 01:59:20,877
TALIESIN: There's one on the roof still, too.

1852
01:59:20,877 --> 01:59:29,911
MATT: Well, that's not one of the skeletal ones.
That's going to be, with disadvantage, 17 to hit.

1853
01:59:29,911 --> 01:59:31,574
MARISHA: 17 hits.

1854
01:59:31,574 --> 01:59:37,625
MATT: 17 hit. It bites out towards you with its
broken toothy jaws and you suffer six points of

1855
01:59:37,625 --> 01:59:42,805
piercing damage as the jaws clamp down on your
forearm and you're like "Oh god!" It's pushing now

1856
01:59:42,805 --> 01:59:47,046
to try to find the space next to the larger gnoll
and they're both currently blocking the doorway

1857
01:59:47,046 --> 01:59:48,267
from your escape.

1858
01:59:48,267 --> 01:59:52,315
MARISHA: I'm doing the animal control thing and be
like: No, no, bad.

1859
01:59:52,315 --> 01:59:55,672
MATT: Which, by the way, top of the round. Beau,
your go.

1860
01:59:55,672 --> 02:00:05,769
MARISHA: My go, okay. Let me put these hit points
in. Apply changes.

1861
02:00:05,769 --> 02:00:12,796
LAURA: This makes my duplicate way less fun if I
can't move her.

1862
02:00:12,796 --> 02:00:15,527
TALIESIN: You get bonus actions all the time.

1863
02:00:15,527 --> 02:00:18,288
LAURA: That's my spiritual weapon.

1864
02:00:18,288 --> 02:00:22,799
SAM: She may move if you move away from her 30
feet; she may just come with you.

1865
02:00:22,799 --> 02:00:24,418
LAURA: 120 feet.

1866
02:00:24,418 --> 02:00:28,170
SAM: Oh shit. But you can leave her out in the
open.

1867
02:00:28,170 --> 02:00:30,484
LAURA: Yeah, at least she's directing fire.

1868
02:00:30,484 --> 02:00:40,340
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to do something creative.
I'm going to take the arrow that Nott just fired

1869
02:00:40,387 --> 02:00:46,773
into the guy's chest. I'm going to grab it. Can I
rip it out with my off-hand, spin around, and stab

1870
02:00:46,773 --> 02:00:48,619
him back in the blade?

1871
02:00:48,619 --> 02:00:52,180
MATT: Awesome, go ahead and roll for your main
attack.

1872
02:00:52,180 --> 02:00:59,775
MARISHA: God blessed fuck. That's not good. That's
a ten.

1873
02:00:59,775 --> 02:01:05,494
MATT: You pull it out. There's a horrible pained
yelp as you yank it out. As you spin around and

1874
02:01:05,494 --> 02:01:11,592
attempt to slam it into its back, its giant, thick
gnoll arm slams into the door frame and blocks

1875
02:01:11,592 --> 02:01:15,754
your ability to pass forward. You get caught over
its arm and have to withdraw.

1876
02:01:15,754 --> 02:01:21,482
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to take my other off-hand
attack on the one that just bit down on me. I'm

1877
02:01:21,482 --> 02:01:25,226
going to rip from it and elbow crack it right in
the nose.

1878
02:01:25,226 --> 02:01:27,403
MATT: The one that just bit you? All right, go for
it.

1879
02:01:27,403 --> 02:01:31,173
MARISHA: Damn it. That's 11.

1880
02:01:31,173 --> 02:01:37,202
MATT: 11? 11 doesn't hit unfortunately. Lot of
whiffing on both sides when it comes around Beau,

1881
02:01:37,202 --> 02:01:42,926
but as you attempt to strike out with the elbow,
it does strike its skull, and its jaw unhinges and

1882
02:01:42,926 --> 02:01:45,159
snaps it back into place.

1883
02:01:45,159 --> 02:01:48,313
MARISHA: Shit, that was my bonus action, wasn't
it?

1884
02:01:48,313 --> 02:01:49,417
MATT: Yep.

1885
02:01:49,417 --> 02:01:53,622
MARISHA: I can't use a ki point, can I?

1886
02:01:53,622 --> 02:01:58,738
MATT: As a bonus action, you can use a ki point to
do two as your bonus if you have it. Flurry of Blows.

1887
02:01:58,738 --> 02:02:03,120
MARISHA: I was wanting to do a ki point to do
Patient Defense again.

1888
02:02:03,120 --> 02:02:06,104
MATT: No, you used your bonus action, sorry. You
want to move or you want to stay where you are?

1889
02:02:06,104 --> 02:02:08,633
MARISHA: Yeah, can I back up into the house and
close the door?

1890
02:02:08,633 --> 02:02:13,272
MATT: The door frame is pretty banged up, you can
try. You can certainly try.

1891
02:02:13,272 --> 02:02:14,739
MARISHA: Sure!

1892
02:02:14,739 --> 02:02:22,928
MATT: Taking a step back, one has spears, so
you're still in its melee range as you try and

1893
02:02:22,928 --> 02:02:25,725
close the door. They'll both get attacks of
opportunity on you if you do that.

1894
02:02:25,725 --> 02:02:27,047
MARISHA: No, I'll stay.

1895
02:02:27,047 --> 02:02:30,898
MATT: Okay, so you stay there holding your
position. That ends Beau's turn. The gnolls go.

1896
02:02:30,898 --> 02:02:36,911
Before we do anything, the one that's right next
to the guy on the wall, what do you want it to do?

1897
02:02:36,911 --> 02:02:43,086
TRAVIS: Melee, so if he has a weapon or anything,
hit him. If not, just knock him the fuck off the roof.

1898
02:02:43,086 --> 02:02:45,125
MATT: He has a spear or you can make a shove, up
to you.

1899
02:02:45,125 --> 02:02:46,360
TRAVIS: Spear!

1900
02:02:46,360 --> 02:02:52,601
MATT: All right, so the spear attack, it's going
to, as it climbs to the top and lunges out with

1901
02:02:52,601 --> 02:02:55,109
its arm. Go ahead and make an attack roll for me.

1902
02:02:55,109 --> 02:02:57,483
TRAVIS: Oh, okay. Plus anything?

1903
02:02:57,483 --> 02:02:59,119
MATT: It is plus five.

1904
02:02:59,119 --> 02:03:00,233
TRAVIS: That's a 20.

1905
02:03:00,233 --> 02:03:01,147
MATT: Sorry, plus four.

1906
02:03:01,147 --> 02:03:02,153
TRAVIS: That's a 19.

1907
02:03:02,153 --> 02:03:11,361
MATT: 19 definitely hits. Go ahead and roll 1d6
damage plus two. Two hands technically, so that

1908
02:03:11,361 --> 02:03:12,884
would be 1d8. Sorry.

1909
02:03:12,884 --> 02:03:15,943
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's much better. Nine.

1910
02:03:15,943 --> 02:03:28,413
MATT: Nine. Nein! It jams the spear with both hands into
its friend and the gnoll yelps and grabs it and

1911
02:03:28,413 --> 02:03:34,357
pulls it out and looks at it confused and angry.
Trying to figure out what exactly happened. As it

1912
02:03:34,357 --> 02:03:42,596
does so, it's going to attempt to shove it off the
wall that just hit it. Make a roll for the

1913
02:03:42,596 --> 02:03:44,747
athletics check of the other gnoll.

1914
02:03:44,747 --> 02:03:46,611
TRAVIS: Adding my modifier or its?

1915
02:03:46,611 --> 02:03:47,731
MATT: Its modifier.

1916
02:03:47,731 --> 02:03:48,856
TRAVIS: 16 plus?

1917
02:03:48,856 --> 02:03:55,544
MATT: 16 plus two. It beat it. It rolled a 17.
After it gets stabbed and looks back at the gnoll

1918
02:03:55,544 --> 02:04:02,502
that you took control and Sparta-kicks it off of
the edge of the roof. It slides and tumbles down,

1919
02:04:02,502 --> 02:04:14,986
landing onto the ground prone right next to Molly.
It does suffer one point of falling damage. Molly,

1920
02:04:14,986 --> 02:04:19,021
you watch as it tumbles and hits the dirt next to
you and it's like (groans). You watch as this

1921
02:04:19,021 --> 02:04:22,616
mystical crown of weird iron horns are floating
above its head.

1922
02:04:22,616 --> 02:04:25,398
TALIESIN: Is this--?

1923
02:04:25,398 --> 02:04:40,437
MATT: That takes up his turn. This guy's going to
move forward and advance. This is unfortunate for

1924
02:04:40,437 --> 02:04:46,042
Beau, partially. This one is going to fire at
Beau. This one actually can see Nott and this one

1925
02:04:46,042 --> 02:04:54,097
is going to take a shot at Nott as well. So one
attack against you, Beau, from that gnoll there.

1926
02:04:54,097 --> 02:05:00,301
That's going to be 11, misses. It actually hits
the wall and embeds itself into the side of the

1927
02:05:00,301 --> 02:05:06,671
door frame. The two attacking you, Nott-- You do
have partial cover on these guys. Half cover will

1928
02:05:06,671 --> 02:05:12,938
be plus two bonus to AC. The first one is going to be a
20.

1929
02:05:12,938 --> 02:05:14,154
SAM: Hits.

1930
02:05:14,154 --> 02:05:24,574
MATT: The second one is a natural two. The one
that does hit you, you suffer nine points of

1931
02:05:24,574 --> 02:05:32,095
piercing damage. A lot of nines tonight! As the
arrow suddenly arcs upward and hits you right in

1932
02:05:32,095 --> 02:05:36,957
the side of the jaw and carves through part of
your neck that way before it exits out the other

1933
02:05:36,957 --> 02:05:40,587
side. You have this big gash on the side. It
doesn't quite hit the jugular, thankfully, but it

1934
02:05:40,587 --> 02:05:42,914
is pretty messy as you are starting to bleed down
the side of your neck.

1935
02:05:42,914 --> 02:05:44,840
LAURA: Isn't she harder to hit because she's so
little?

1936
02:05:44,840 --> 02:05:58,153
MATT: Yeah, but that one had some decent aim.
These guys here continue to push forward that way

1937
02:05:58,153 --> 02:06:02,161
and they're going to use their other action to
push forward. This guy is going to go ahead and

1938
02:06:02,161 --> 02:06:06,478
throw another body up onto this as the other one's
pushing it. They don't get quite as far because

1939
02:06:06,478 --> 02:06:10,120
one of them stopped pushing, but they're getting
to the edge of the map. The one that's snarling

1940
02:06:10,120 --> 02:06:24,920
there is watching them vanish behind. This guy
around the edge is going to, let's see. Seeing you

1941
02:06:24,920 --> 02:06:29,348
yelp up in the window, he's going to take a shot
at you. Beau's currently being dealt with two of

1942
02:06:29,348 --> 02:06:36,209
them and you're up in the flames right now. That
is going to be a 15, which I do not believe hits.

1943
02:06:36,209 --> 02:06:37,261
SAM: No.

1944
02:06:37,261 --> 02:06:41,159
MATT: This one strikes the ember wood on the
outside and breaks through, but it only comes

1945
02:06:41,159 --> 02:06:50,229
partially out and is embedded, missing you by an
inch. That finishes the gnolls' turn, I believe.

1946
02:06:50,229 --> 02:06:59,872
Oh, this guy is going to turn and take a swing at
Beau with a spear, two hands. That is a 16.

1947
02:06:59,872 --> 02:07:01,218
MARISHA: Miss.

1948
02:07:01,218 --> 02:07:06,261
MATT: 16 misses. It swings out and you actually
catch the spear off to the side and you're now in

1949
02:07:06,261 --> 02:07:08,592
a strength tug of war with its own weapon as
it's--

1950
02:07:08,592 --> 02:07:17,982
MARISHA: My stick! Mine! Drop it! Bad! Do you want
to play or not?

1951
02:07:17,982 --> 02:07:22,359
MATT: Ending their go, it goes to Fjord's turn.

1952
02:07:22,359 --> 02:07:28,399
TRAVIS: Crown of Madness piece of shit. Can I go
ahead and send, using my action to maintain it,

1953
02:07:28,399 --> 02:07:31,679
can I send that stupid ass back up the roof?

1954
02:07:31,679 --> 02:07:35,857
MATT: Let me double-check something.

1955
02:07:35,857 --> 02:07:37,979
TALIESIN: The damage may have--

1956
02:07:37,979 --> 02:07:39,732
TRAVIS: Knocked it out. No!

1957
02:07:39,732 --> 02:07:49,423
MATT: I don't know if that's the case. It's not
just that. It already moved on its turn, it takes

1958
02:07:49,423 --> 02:07:53,032
its turn, you have to spend your action to maintain
the spell, so it won't do anything on your turn.

1959
02:07:53,032 --> 02:07:57,833
So either you continue to maintain the spell, and
then next turn it's still under your control, or

1960
02:07:57,884 --> 02:07:59,380
you do whatever you want--

1961
02:07:59,380 --> 02:08:02,876
LAURA: Or you drop it because he's prone and Molly
will get super advantage on hitting him.

1962
02:08:02,876 --> 02:08:04,462
SAM: Super advantage!

1963
02:08:04,462 --> 02:08:06,781
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't know what the crown is.

1964
02:08:06,781 --> 02:08:16,693
TRAVIS: Fuck it, I'll drop it and I'll come into
the street, down the way 30 feet. But I look like

1965
02:08:16,693 --> 02:08:18,144
a gnoll.

1966
02:08:18,144 --> 02:08:22,514
TALIESIN: Concentration's gone.

1967
02:08:22,514 --> 02:08:26,313
MATT: Oh, that's right. Thank you.

1968
02:08:26,313 --> 02:08:28,957
TRAVIS: But I still look like a gnoll.

1969
02:08:28,957 --> 02:08:30,324
MATT: Yes, you do.

1970
02:08:30,324 --> 02:08:33,600
TRAVIS: That will be my turn.

1971
02:08:33,600 --> 02:08:36,867
MATT: All righty, are you holding your action to
do anything?

1972
02:08:36,867 --> 02:08:43,736
TRAVIS: I guess, because I dropped it, I have it.

1973
02:08:43,736 --> 02:08:45,814
MATT: You have your action because you didn't
maintain the spell.

1974
02:08:45,814 --> 02:08:53,357
TRAVIS: With my action, I'm going to cast
Hexblade's Curse on that big son of a bitch.

1975
02:08:53,357 --> 02:08:54,431
MATT: This guy?

1976
02:08:54,431 --> 02:08:55,464
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1977
02:08:55,464 --> 02:08:57,177
MATT: I believe it's a bonus action to do that,
isn't it?

1978
02:08:57,177 --> 02:08:58,144
TRAVIS: It is.

1979
02:08:58,144 --> 02:08:59,786
MATT: So you still have your action.

1980
02:08:59,786 --> 02:09:04,292
TALIESIN: You could even make it to get into his
face.

1981
02:09:04,292 --> 02:09:17,833
TRAVIS: With my action, I will Eldritch Blast from
where I am.

1982
02:09:17,833 --> 02:09:19,859
MATT: Go for it, make the attack roll.

1983
02:09:19,859 --> 02:09:25,137
TRAVIS: Thank you. Skadoosh. It's a 15 plus six,
21.

1984
02:09:25,137 --> 02:09:26,884
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

1985
02:09:26,884 --> 02:09:43,632
TRAVIS: Amazing, 1d10. (counting) Sorry, I
should've looked at this beforehand. 14.

1986
02:09:43,632 --> 02:09:50,528
MATT: 14 points of damage. As you rush up, you
watch as this squatter gnoll saunters out in the

1987
02:09:50,528 --> 02:09:56,864
middle, points to the seeming leader of this
cluster, and as it does, the soot and ash from the

1988
02:09:56,864 --> 02:10:01,470
ground begins to affix itself around the inside of
its armor, holding it in place for the moment.

1989
02:10:01,470 --> 02:10:09,814
With the other hand holding the suddenly
appearing barnacle-studded blade, you unleash

1990
02:10:09,814 --> 02:10:15,427
this blast of eldritch energy that slams into the
center of the armor. You watch as the energy

1991
02:10:15,427 --> 02:10:20,833
courses through all of the crevices between the
scales that are overlapping. As it fades, you

1992
02:10:20,833 --> 02:10:26,088
watch as this bit of steam and blood come out of
its mouth, and it turns right to you, its head

1993
02:10:26,088 --> 02:10:29,994
turning, it spits a cluster.

1994
02:10:29,994 --> 02:10:31,809
TRAVIS: (yipping)

1995
02:10:31,809 --> 02:10:33,454
MATT: We'll get to that. That's your turn?

1996
02:10:33,454 --> 02:10:34,442
TRAVIS: That's it.

1997
02:10:34,442 --> 02:10:37,680
MATT: Okay, it's his turn now. Now it-- (shrieks
and growls)

1998
02:10:37,680 --> 02:10:40,362
(laughter)

1999
02:10:40,362 --> 02:10:48,267
MATT: And goes running and rushes up towards you.
You watch as previously it just had this large

2000
02:10:48,267 --> 02:10:54,828
pole on its back? It pulls it and brings it loose
as you see a large two-handed glaive come swooping,

2001
02:10:54,828 --> 02:10:59,333
which doesn't actually-- it can get to there and
still hit you because of its reach. As it runs

2002
02:10:59,333 --> 02:11:02,181
forward, it brings it down. It's going to
multi-attack you twice with it.

2003
02:11:02,181 --> 02:11:03,334
TRAVIS: Okay.

2004
02:11:03,334 --> 02:11:07,601
MATT: First one is going to be a 21 to hit?

2005
02:11:07,601 --> 02:11:08,803
TRAVIS: Oh, that'll hit.

2006
02:11:08,803 --> 02:11:11,352
MATT: And a 17 to hit.

2007
02:11:11,352 --> 02:11:12,224
TRAVIS: Both hit.

2008
02:11:12,224 --> 02:11:13,608
MATT: Both hit. All right.

2009
02:11:13,608 --> 02:11:17,056
TRAVIS: That's okay, I've got the armor. It deals
damage when you hit me.

2010
02:11:17,056 --> 02:11:18,393
LIAM and LAURA: Ooh.

2011
02:11:18,393 --> 02:11:24,311
MATT: That is eight points of slashing damage on
the first hit. Wham! As the large polearm-- the

2012
02:11:24,311 --> 02:11:28,311
axe-like hooked blade at the end of it. You can
see the same spines that are on its armor are

2013
02:11:28,311 --> 02:11:31,790
affixed to the edge of it. As it slams down
towards you, the armor bursts, this cold energy

2014
02:11:31,790 --> 02:11:33,184
that-- how much damage does he take?

2015
02:11:33,184 --> 02:11:38,432
TRAVIS: I got ten temporary hit points at
second level, so he takes eight points of cold damage.

2016
02:11:38,432 --> 02:11:45,721
MATT: Slick. Second strike? He rolled a one. That
is going to be four points of slashing damage for

2017
02:11:45,721 --> 02:11:46,942
the second strike.

2018
02:11:46,942 --> 02:11:49,533
TRAVIS: So he'll take two points of cold damage
and I'll take the other two points.

2019
02:11:49,533 --> 02:11:50,732
MATT: Nice.

2020
02:11:50,732 --> 02:11:55,041
MARISHA: You have so many fun gadgets!

2021
02:11:55,041 --> 02:12:01,544
MATT: Oh! He does get back his Incite Rampage. At
which point, he's going to go ahead and glance

2022
02:12:01,544 --> 02:12:10,743
over towards the gnoll that is-- hmm.

2023
02:12:10,743 --> 02:12:11,963
SAM: The grassy gnoll?

2024
02:12:11,963 --> 02:12:13,347
MATT: The grassy gnoll, yes. Thank you, Sam.

2025
02:12:13,347 --> 02:12:15,751
TRAVIS: Thank you, Sam.

2026
02:12:15,751 --> 02:12:21,460
MATT: All right, yeah. The only one that they can
currently see that's in melee range at the moment,

2027
02:12:21,460 --> 02:12:23,513
because the wall's there, is going to be the one
next to Beau.

2028
02:12:23,513 --> 02:12:26,797
SAM: No, really. Thank you, Sam.

2029
02:12:26,797 --> 02:12:36,995
MATT: Sincerely. So after it strikes you twice
with the glaive, bits of ice shards spray off with

2030
02:12:36,995 --> 02:12:41,526
each blow now affixing to the ash and the energy
that's instilled this armor after you blasted it.

2031
02:12:41,526 --> 02:12:47,308
It looks over to the one right in front of Beau
and goes (growls and snarls) and it glances over

2032
02:12:47,308 --> 02:12:51,768
its shoulder, and with renewed strength, pulls the
spear free from your grasp and goes for another

2033
02:12:51,768 --> 02:12:53,205
strike against you as a reaction.

2034
02:12:53,205 --> 02:12:54,323
MARISHA: Bad dog.

2035
02:12:54,323 --> 02:12:56,367
MATT: That is going to be a 19 to hit.

2036
02:12:56,367 --> 02:12:58,506
MARISHA: How much?

2037
02:12:58,506 --> 02:12:59,408
MATT: 19.

2038
02:12:59,408 --> 02:13:00,446
MARISHA: That one hits.

2039
02:13:00,446 --> 02:13:02,136
SAM: How many are engaged with you right now?

2040
02:13:02,136 --> 02:13:03,089
MATT: Two.

2041
02:13:03,089 --> 02:13:04,029
MARISHA: Three? Two?

2042
02:13:04,029 --> 02:13:05,025
LAURA: She's so wanted.

2043
02:13:05,025 --> 02:13:09,138
MATT: That's going to be seven points of piercing
damage.

2044
02:13:09,138 --> 02:13:11,275
LIAM: Apologies to my friend.

2045
02:13:11,275 --> 02:13:18,211
MATT: All righty, that's going to end his turn and
the guards back here are going to come forward and--

2046
02:13:18,211 --> 02:13:19,929
TRAVIS: Oh, let's go this way!

2047
02:13:19,929 --> 02:13:23,626
MATT: They're both going to fire at the one on the
rooftop.

2048
02:13:23,626 --> 02:13:25,159
SAM, TRAVIS, and TALIESIN: Hey!

2049
02:13:25,159 --> 02:13:28,945
LAURA: (laughter) And a miss and a miss!

2050
02:13:28,945 --> 02:13:33,249
MATT: First one's a miss. Second one is a 16. That
hits.

2051
02:13:33,249 --> 02:13:34,699
SAM: Hey!

2052
02:13:34,699 --> 02:13:41,179
MATT: It's an eight plus two so that's ten points
of damage. Based on the Crown of Madness damage it

2053
02:13:41,179 --> 02:13:45,884
took earlier, the spear's enough to finish it
off. You watch as on the top, it goes and draws an

2054
02:13:45,943 --> 02:13:50,888
arrow and pulls it back, looking down at you as
you're down in the square. Then one of the guards

2055
02:13:50,888 --> 02:13:57,598
pulls its crossbow and (shrieks) it stumbles back
and falls dead on the ground.

2056
02:13:57,598 --> 02:13:59,320
TRAVIS: Here we go.

2057
02:13:59,320 --> 02:14:05,660
MATT: That ends that one, the other guard over
there. They're going to go ahead and move up the

2058
02:14:05,660 --> 02:14:10,064
side and step out now that it seems to be opening
and is going to fire towards the skeletal gnoll

2059
02:14:10,064 --> 02:14:13,936
that is currently in the process of harassing the
image that as far as they're concerned is just

2060
02:14:13,936 --> 02:14:22,283
Jester. It's going to be-- yeah, that hits.
Without issue.

2061
02:14:22,283 --> 02:14:25,640
TALIESIN: I'm not used to melee combat. This is so
terrifying.

2062
02:14:25,640 --> 02:14:26,656
LAURA: Yeah, right?

2063
02:14:26,656 --> 02:14:27,653
TRAVIS: Get up in that.

2064
02:14:27,653 --> 02:14:28,526
TALIESIN: I don't want to get up in that.

2065
02:14:28,526 --> 02:14:30,063
TRAVIS: Get a whole bunch of stank right in your
face.

2066
02:14:30,063 --> 02:14:34,954
MATT: Pulls out the heavy crossbow and fires and
does 11 points of damage, which is enough to

2067
02:14:34,954 --> 02:14:42,392
shatter the skeletal gnoll witherling. As it falls
to the ground and breaks into a scattered pile of

2068
02:14:42,392 --> 02:14:48,043
bone bits and dried gnoll flesh. That ends the
guards' turn. Molly, you're up.

2069
02:14:48,043 --> 02:14:53,383
TALIESIN: I'm going to stab this thing that just
fell right in front of me. Just going to stab it.

2070
02:14:53,383 --> 02:14:58,537
MATT: It is prone, so I believe you have advantage
against it. Yep! With each attack.

2071
02:14:58,537 --> 02:15:04,134
TALIESIN: Question about Rite of the Dawn, is it
just plus three or is it just my wisdom or is it

2072
02:15:04,134 --> 02:15:05,142
also a--?

2073
02:15:05,142 --> 02:15:07,579
MATT: Wisdom bonus is against undead creatures.

2074
02:15:07,579 --> 02:15:09,164
TALIESIN: Okay, this is not an undead creature.

2075
02:15:09,164 --> 02:15:13,801
MATT: It is not. There are undead creatures
among the pack, but there are none there. It's just

2076
02:15:13,862 --> 02:15:15,336
straight Rite damage.

2077
02:15:15,336 --> 02:15:20,687
TALIESIN: So it's just an extra 1d4. Okay,
just checking. That's how that works. Okay, cool.

2078
02:15:20,687 --> 02:15:24,686
See if I hit? Thank you. 13?

2079
02:15:24,686 --> 02:15:27,069
MATT: 13 unfortunately misses. The first strike--

2080
02:15:27,069 --> 02:15:28,088
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

2081
02:15:28,088 --> 02:15:31,913
MATT: As you swing down onto the ground, it
scrambles about and pulls its shield up just in

2082
02:15:31,913 --> 02:15:37,135
time. Your blade catches the edge, embeds itself
an inch into its rear.

2083
02:15:37,228 --> 02:15:38,953
TALIESIN: I hit it with the other one.

2084
02:15:38,953 --> 02:15:42,345
MATT: You use your one blade to push the shield
off to the side as it's still there, and trying to

2085
02:15:42,345 --> 02:15:44,356
jam downward. Go for it.

2086
02:15:44,356 --> 02:15:45,742
TRAVIS: Definitely hit.

2087
02:15:45,742 --> 02:15:48,890
TALIESIN: Come on. Oh, thank God. 21.

2088
02:15:48,890 --> 02:15:50,465
MATT: 21 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

2089
02:15:50,465 --> 02:15:53,507
TRAVIS: (chanting) Level three! Level three!

2090
02:15:53,507 --> 02:16:00,063
TALIESIN: So that's nine points of damage.

2091
02:16:00,063 --> 02:16:07,260
MATT: Nine points of damage. You manage to jam
underneath and hit it in the chest. It shrieks with pain

2092
02:16:07,260 --> 02:16:13,775
and pushes the blade out of its body with a sheer
flexing of its muscle. It begins to try and get up

2093
02:16:13,922 --> 02:16:18,996
off the ground. It's hurt, but it's still standing or about
to be standing in a moment. You can move if you'd

2094
02:16:18,996 --> 02:16:20,574
like to.

2095
02:16:20,574 --> 02:16:23,452
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's right. I can break combat
with it. It doesn't matter, right? At this point?

2096
02:16:23,452 --> 02:16:24,963
Or does it get an attack of opportunity?

2097
02:16:24,963 --> 02:16:26,947
MATT: It does get an attack of opportunity, but it
has disadvantage on him.

2098
02:16:26,947 --> 02:16:34,627
TALIESIN: There's no way I can circle up onto the
wall, is there?

2099
02:16:34,627 --> 02:16:36,079
MATT: Onto the wall?

2100
02:16:36,079 --> 02:16:38,157
TALIESIN: Yeah. Get a little vantage on him.

2101
02:16:38,157 --> 02:16:39,640
MATT: You could.

2102
02:16:39,640 --> 02:16:43,136
TALIESIN: I want to be able to hop on because I want to
head that direction afterwards. All right.

2103
02:16:43,136 --> 02:16:44,883
MATT: You get up onto the wall.

2104
02:16:44,883 --> 02:16:47,420
TALIESIN: And that way, if he tries to run or do
anything, I can futz with him.

2105
02:16:47,420 --> 02:16:49,890
MATT: Cool, that's fine. Molly, your turn is over.
Jester, you're up.

2106
02:16:49,890 --> 02:16:57,348
LAURA: Yay! I'm going to run away from this guy
that's next to me. I'm going to run out into the

2107
02:16:57,348 --> 02:16:58,836
alley so I can see people.

2108
02:16:58,836 --> 02:16:59,628
MATT: This way?

2109
02:16:59,628 --> 02:17:00,416
LAURA: Yeah.

2110
02:17:00,416 --> 02:17:03,935
MATT: As you rush out, it takes a swing attack of
opportunity towards you. This is going to be with

2111
02:17:03,935 --> 02:17:11,609
a club. It has a heavy wooden club and it makes a
giant arc towards you as you speed away. That is

2112
02:17:11,609 --> 02:17:13,331
19 to hit.

2113
02:17:13,331 --> 02:17:14,723
LAURA: Can I use a reaction on that?

2114
02:17:14,723 --> 02:17:15,942
MATT: You can, yeah.

2115
02:17:15,942 --> 02:17:25,846
LAURA: I'm going to say "I am rubber and you are
glue" and use Hellish Rebuke on him. In Infernal.

2116
02:17:25,846 --> 02:17:31,029
MATT: All right. Well, first, the club hits you
and you take five points of bludgeoning damage.

2117
02:17:31,029 --> 02:17:32,072
LAURA: Okay.

2118
02:17:32,072 --> 02:17:37,261
MATT: As you turn around, you say that at him and
unleash your Hellish Rebuke. He has to make a

2119
02:17:37,261 --> 02:17:38,769
constitution saving throw, I believe it is,
right?

2120
02:17:38,769 --> 02:17:41,324
LAURA: Maybe. Hold on.

2121
02:17:41,324 --> 02:17:42,660
SAM: You have to save first.

2122
02:17:42,660 --> 02:17:45,320
LAURA: I'm applying my changes to my health.

2123
02:17:45,320 --> 02:17:47,984
SAM: Now close out of that.

2124
02:17:47,984 --> 02:17:49,091
LAURA: This is so much!

2125
02:17:49,091 --> 02:17:53,380
MATT: It has to make a constitution save-- No,
that's dexterity saving throw, which it does not

2126
02:17:53,380 --> 02:18:00,786
make. It's seven. So it suffers 2d10 cold damage. So how
much did you deal?

2127
02:18:00,786 --> 02:18:06,799
LAURA: Oh, 2d10. Okay. Nine.

2128
02:18:06,799 --> 02:18:09,254
ALL: Nine.

2129
02:18:09,254 --> 02:18:10,986
TALIESIN: This is becoming a thing.

2130
02:18:10,986 --> 02:18:16,218
LIAM: So sorry, guys. There you go.

2131
02:18:16,218 --> 02:18:24,001
MATT: As you dart away, you release your fury and
anger, and you watch as suddenly this blast of cold

2132
02:18:24,001 --> 02:18:31,970
water and ice energy burst out of its body. The
inside of its somewhat cavernous ribcage is now

2133
02:18:31,970 --> 02:18:35,616
filled with frost crystals, jutting out and
breaking parts of the ribs. It looks heavily

2134
02:18:35,616 --> 02:18:37,433
damaged, but still standing.

2135
02:18:37,433 --> 02:18:39,699
LAURA: Ooh, chilly!

2136
02:18:39,699 --> 02:18:43,052
MATT: All righty.

2137
02:18:43,052 --> 02:18:44,868
SAM: You still have your action, right?

2138
02:18:44,925 --> 02:18:46,262
LAURA: I know, and my bonus action!

2139
02:18:46,262 --> 02:18:47,189
MATT: Yeah.

2140
02:18:47,189 --> 02:18:51,297
LAURA: So for my bonus action, I'm going to send
my lollipop towards the giant guy and try to hit

2141
02:18:51,297 --> 02:19:03,786
him. At the same time, I'm going to cast-- What am
I going to cast? Radiant-- No, Guiding Bolt!

2142
02:19:03,786 --> 02:19:05,424
MATT: Okay.

2143
02:19:05,424 --> 02:19:09,164
LAURA: With, you know, I'm going to do a little
flourish, like pink energy comes out.

2144
02:19:09,164 --> 02:19:11,876
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make your spell attack.

2145
02:19:11,876 --> 02:19:17,921
LAURA: Okay. Spell attack? Ooh, that's good.
That's a 19 plus five.

2146
02:19:17,921 --> 02:19:19,884
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

2147
02:19:19,884 --> 02:19:20,934
LAURA: Okay.

2148
02:19:20,934 --> 02:19:22,070
TALIESIN: That's new dice, man.

2149
02:19:22,070 --> 02:19:22,908
LAURA: Yes, yes, yes.

2150
02:19:22,908 --> 02:19:24,104
SAM: I touched one.

2151
02:19:24,104 --> 02:19:25,672
LAURA: You didn't touch these ones.

2152
02:19:25,672 --> 02:19:27,200
SAM: That's why they rolled so shit.

2153
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:29,983
LAURA: Six, eight, nine radiant.

2154
02:19:29,983 --> 02:19:31,639
ALL: Nine!

2155
02:19:31,639 --> 02:19:34,222
MATT: What's up with the nines? It's getting
ridiculous.

2156
02:19:34,222 --> 02:19:35,741
TRAVIS: CritRoleStats is going-- (clicking).

2157
02:19:35,741 --> 02:19:37,103
MATT: Yep.

2158
02:19:37,103 --> 02:19:38,370
LIAM: We're losing subscribers in Europe
right now.

2159
02:19:38,370 --> 02:19:43,930
LAURA: That's radiant damage, and then the
Spiritual Weapon--

2160
02:19:43,930 --> 02:19:47,817
MATT: All right. Guiding Bolt: the next attack
against it has advantage.

2161
02:19:47,817 --> 02:19:50,889
LAURA: Oh, good. Then the Spiritual Weapon will
have advantage. Great!

2162
02:19:50,889 --> 02:19:52,577
LIAM: Halt den Mund!

2163
02:19:52,577 --> 02:19:55,151
LAURA: Oh, good. So that's 20.

2164
02:19:55,151 --> 02:19:57,289
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage for Spiritual
Weapon.

2165
02:19:57,289 --> 02:19:58,406
TRAVIS: Nice!

2166
02:19:58,406 --> 02:20:03,663
LAURA: Where's my eight? Six plus three is nine!

2167
02:20:03,663 --> 02:20:06,086
ALL: Nine!

2168
02:20:06,086 --> 02:20:14,891
MATT: This is absurd, guys. This is absurd. All
righty, does that end your turn?

2169
02:20:14,891 --> 02:20:19,175
LAURA: Oh, I'm going to use the rest of my
movement to run over and try to get behind this wall.

2170
02:20:19,175 --> 02:20:24,830
MATT: You're from over there, that's (counting)
20, you have ten more feet. You can get there.

2171
02:20:24,830 --> 02:20:28,421
LAURA: That'll work. I was going to go to the
brick wall.

2172
02:20:28,421 --> 02:20:30,592
MATT: Oh, the brick wall. You'll get up onto it.

2173
02:20:30,592 --> 02:20:32,142
LAURA: Yeah, sure, why not?

2174
02:20:32,142 --> 02:20:35,071
MATT: It's considered rough terrain, so you
technically can't get all the way on the other

2175
02:20:35,071 --> 02:20:40,086
side. You climb up onto it. That finishes your
turn. As you finish blasting with the Guiding

2176
02:20:40,086 --> 02:20:45,335
Bolt, at the same time as it slams and sparkles
you watch as the lollipop clubs down onto the

2177
02:20:45,335 --> 02:20:50,893
back of its head. That ends your turn. Caleb,
Nott, you're up.

2178
02:20:50,893 --> 02:20:57,466
LIAM: Okay. I start moving back towards the same
vantage point I had before and I see Jester above

2179
02:20:57,466 --> 02:21:01,736
me, and I see a guy over there covered in ice, and
I whip around and the diamond comes up and I go

2180
02:21:01,736 --> 02:21:07,914
(sizzling) and I was about to make it acid, but
there's ice everywhere so it's ice now. Chromatic

2181
02:21:07,914 --> 02:21:11,383
Orb off to the big guy in the middle of town
square, yeah.

2182
02:21:11,383 --> 02:21:13,679
MATT: Go ahead and make the attack roll.

2183
02:21:13,679 --> 02:21:15,588
LIAM: It misses entirely.

2184
02:21:15,588 --> 02:21:22,504
MATT: It spins and hits the ground. You watch as
ice crawls up the side of the building. I will say

2185
02:21:22,504 --> 02:21:27,722
it does manage to put out part of the fire that is
currently burning the building.

2186
02:21:27,722 --> 02:21:29,994
MARISHA: You did a good thing here. You did good
today.

2187
02:21:29,994 --> 02:21:36,661
TALIESIN: You made lemonade. Way to make some
lemonade.

2188
02:21:36,661 --> 02:21:39,916
MARISHA: You just got the participation trophy.

2189
02:21:39,916 --> 02:21:44,249
LIAM: Then I use the rest of my movement to press
my back against the wall and go nein, nein, nein.

2190
02:21:44,249 --> 02:21:48,174
MATT: As you move out, where are you at now?

2191
02:21:48,174 --> 02:21:49,960
LIAM: Still behind the same building.

2192
02:21:49,960 --> 02:21:57,503
MATT: You dart out and fire, and then back. All
righty. That ends your turn. Nott!

2193
02:21:57,503 --> 02:22:04,864
SAM: Just a little perspective here. The gnolls
pushing away the cart, how many are there? And

2194
02:22:04,864 --> 02:22:06,317
what are they--?

2195
02:22:06,317 --> 02:22:10,873
MATT: There are currently three that are gathered
around it and in the process of pushing it.

2196
02:22:10,873 --> 02:22:12,901
They're getting momentum as it's going.

2197
02:22:12,901 --> 02:22:16,947
SAM: No obvious weak points on the cart or
anything?

2198
02:22:16,947 --> 02:22:20,894
MATT: Make a perception check. It will take your
bonus action to do so.

2199
02:22:20,894 --> 02:22:22,075
MARISHA: Take out a wheel!

2200
02:22:22,075 --> 02:22:24,941
SAM: It's going to take my bonus action to do so?
Then I will not look at the cart.

2201
02:22:24,941 --> 02:22:27,604
TALIESIN: It will move slower if we kill them.

2202
02:22:27,604 --> 02:22:35,894
SAM: I'm sure it will, but I don't know if I could
kill one in one shot. Instead I will, using my

2203
02:22:35,894 --> 02:22:45,029
goblin feet claws, just dig in and I'm going to go
upside down so I can see into where Beau is and

2204
02:22:45,029 --> 02:22:47,955
shoot one of the ones next to her.

2205
02:22:47,955 --> 02:22:49,116
LAURA: You can do that?!

2206
02:22:49,116 --> 02:22:50,117
SAM: I don't know!

2207
02:22:50,117 --> 02:22:56,361
MATT: As you dig in and hang down, you watch as
your hood and hair hangs upside down. You pull the

2208
02:22:56,361 --> 02:23:00,650
crossbow down. The tension of the bolt is holding
it in, thankfully, otherwise it would just fall

2209
02:23:00,650 --> 02:23:04,490
from its upside down standpoint, and you
fire! You can go ahead and make a strike.

2210
02:23:04,490 --> 02:23:12,993
Technically you have two that you're in view of
here, they both have three-quarters cover because

2211
02:23:12,993 --> 02:23:14,752
of the nearby door and the angle.

2212
02:23:14,752 --> 02:23:15,715
SAM: The ones next to her?

2213
02:23:15,715 --> 02:23:17,229
MATT: Yeah.

2214
02:23:17,229 --> 02:23:18,917
SAM: Ugh. Well, I got to hit them.

2215
02:23:18,917 --> 02:23:20,622
MATT: Which one are you shooting? The skeletal one
or the--?

2216
02:23:20,622 --> 02:23:23,291
SAM: The one that I hit before.

2217
02:23:23,291 --> 02:23:24,926
MATT: Okay, so that one. Go for it.

2218
02:23:24,926 --> 02:23:29,555
SAM: That is 17.

2219
02:23:29,555 --> 02:23:31,460
MARISHA: I think that hits, right?

2220
02:23:31,460 --> 02:23:34,480
MATT: 17 would hit if it didn't have
three-quarters cover, which gives a plus five bonus

2221
02:23:34,480 --> 02:23:35,388
to AC.

2222
02:23:35,388 --> 02:23:36,848
MARISHA: Oh, poopers!

2223
02:23:36,909 --> 02:23:40,272
MATT: Unfortunately, it's just the large part of
the door frame in the way, there's Beau in the

2224
02:23:40,272 --> 02:23:44,765
way, and there's a lot going on in that moment. As
you go and fire it just zips past and slams into

2225
02:23:44,765 --> 02:23:47,044
part of the now broken door that's coming off the
hinges.

2226
02:23:47,044 --> 02:23:50,131
TALIESIN: Man, I hate level three.

2227
02:23:50,131 --> 02:23:55,956
SAM: Cool. I'm going to go pop back up to the top
floor, and use my bonus action to hide.

2228
02:23:55,956 --> 02:23:58,307
MATT: All righty. Go ahead and make a stealth
check.

2229
02:23:58,307 --> 02:24:03,078
SAM: Nope. Ten.

2230
02:24:03,078 --> 02:24:10,689
MATT: You get down low, but your hood and hair are
now frizzed and poking out the side. That ends

2231
02:24:10,689 --> 02:24:19,869
your turn, Nott. This one is going to rush
forward, pursuing Jester. That one is going to

2232
02:24:19,869 --> 02:24:26,652
attempt to continue to whale on Beau. That's going
to be a 15 against Beau.

2233
02:24:26,652 --> 02:24:27,569
MARISHA: Miss.

2234
02:24:27,569 --> 02:24:31,364
MATT: Misses, you just duck out of the way as it
tries to bite you and slam your elbow onto its

2235
02:24:31,364 --> 02:24:36,715
snout, knocking it out of the way. Just holding
on, holding off in this doorway. The one that runs

2236
02:24:36,715 --> 02:24:42,416
up towards you is going to attempt to hit you
again with a club. That is going to be a 19. Again.

2237
02:24:42,416 --> 02:24:43,500
LAURA: Ugh!

2238
02:24:43,500 --> 02:24:50,110
MATT: Oh that's a d4, sorry. That's six points of
bludgeoning damage. Whack! As the club hits you in

2239
02:24:50,110 --> 02:24:54,001
the back of the head as you're just climbing over
the top of the wall. You have to catch yourself

2240
02:24:54,001 --> 02:24:57,670
from tumbling face first into the dirt on the
other side. You manage to catch your footing on

2241
02:24:57,670 --> 02:25:02,481
top of the wall. But it's now up, and in
combat with both you and the guard from earlier.

2242
02:25:02,481 --> 02:25:05,655
That ends their turn. Top of the round, Beau,
you're up.

2243
02:25:05,655 --> 02:25:13,138
MARISHA: Oh god, okay. I'm going to taste a little
bit of blood that's now in my mouth, get real

2244
02:25:13,138 --> 02:25:25,338
fucking pissed off, and I'm going to do a Star
Wars-style flourish and go crack down to the new guy.

2245
02:25:25,338 --> 02:25:30,418
MATT: The skeletal one? There's a skeletal one,
and there's the one that's been fighting you this

2246
02:25:30,418 --> 02:25:31,560
whole time.

2247
02:25:31,560 --> 02:25:33,336
MARISHA: Which one looks like he has less damage?

2248
02:25:33,336 --> 02:25:37,244
MATT: The skeletal one hasn't been damaged yet,
but it looks a little more fragile. The one that

2249
02:25:37,244 --> 02:25:39,216
got shot by Nott earlier still has the big--

2250
02:25:39,216 --> 02:25:40,440
MARISHA: Let's do the skeletal guy.

2251
02:25:40,440 --> 02:25:41,952
MATT: Go for it. Do the attack.

2252
02:25:41,952 --> 02:25:48,926
MARISHA: Not good at all. 14.

2253
02:25:48,926 --> 02:25:53,366
MATT: That hits. Doesn't have as strong an armor class
as the other one.

2254
02:25:53,366 --> 02:25:58,097
MARISHA: Okay. Eight points of damage.

2255
02:25:58,097 --> 02:26:01,963
MATT: Eight points of damage. That one's already
been damaged previously. As you bring the staff

2256
02:26:01,963 --> 02:26:06,671
down with both hands, whack, you slam right
through the center of its chest and clavicle. You

2257
02:26:06,671 --> 02:26:10,238
watch as the torso breaks and folds from the
weight of the blow. The skull tumbles off and hits

2258
02:26:10,238 --> 02:26:12,967
the ground, and it falls into a pile of bones and
rags.

2259
02:26:12,967 --> 02:26:17,813
MARISHA: I'm going to use my bonus action. With
that momentum, I'm going to stick the staff in the

2260
02:26:17,813 --> 02:26:24,282
ground, and use that to lift myself up and do a
two-footer kick into the other guy.

2261
02:26:24,282 --> 02:26:26,812
MATT: Go for it. Single attack?

2262
02:26:26,812 --> 02:26:30,517
MARISHA: Let's do Flurry of Blows.

2263
02:26:30,517 --> 02:26:32,355
MATT: All right, so this is your third ki point?

2264
02:26:32,355 --> 02:26:33,632
MARISHA: Nope, this is my second.

2265
02:26:33,632 --> 02:26:36,584
MATT: Right, because you did the-- No, because you
did flurry earlier, didn't you?

2266
02:26:36,584 --> 02:26:40,775
MARISHA: I did, but I did it as an action, not on
a bonus action, and you said I didn't have to use

2267
02:26:40,775 --> 02:26:41,799
a ki point.

2268
02:26:41,799 --> 02:26:43,906
MATT: No, a Flurry of Blows, I thought.

2269
02:26:43,906 --> 02:26:51,039
MARISHA: I did Patient Defense, I did one Flurry
of Blows--

2270
02:26:51,039 --> 02:26:54,336
MATT: You did the dodge action, as an action,
which doesn't take any ki points. You spent one

2271
02:26:54,336 --> 02:26:56,466
doing a Flurry of Blows earlier.

2272
02:26:56,466 --> 02:26:59,563
MARISHA: I spent one doing deflect, and then one
to do Flurry of Blows.

2273
02:26:59,563 --> 02:27:00,940
MATT: This is your third one.

2274
02:27:00,940 --> 02:27:03,236
MARISHA: No. This is the second one. This is the
first Flurry of Blows I'm doing.

2275
02:27:03,236 --> 02:27:07,164
MATT: I'm sorry, that's what I was asking, my
confusion. Cool, so go for it.

2276
02:27:07,164 --> 02:27:14,000
MARISHA: Shit, I don't remember. This was what I
rolled, right? Okay, not good. Ten.

2277
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:21,339
MATT: Ten against him? Nope. As you kick both feet
forward, one hits and skims off the shoulder. The other?

2278
02:27:21,339 --> 02:27:25,319
MARISHA: The other is okay. 15.

2279
02:27:25,319 --> 02:27:30,137
MATT: 15 just hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

2280
02:27:30,137 --> 02:27:35,204
TRAVIS: (singing) Pour some sugar on him.

2281
02:27:35,204 --> 02:27:36,992
MARISHA: Seven.

2282
02:27:36,992 --> 02:27:42,120
MATT: Seven points of damage? All righty, based on
the damage that you had sustained earlier and the

2283
02:27:42,120 --> 02:27:46,368
blows from earlier, as you strike him with the
other foot, you snap the side of his jaw, which

2284
02:27:46,368 --> 02:27:51,686
breaks out. As he stumbles backward, you take the
back of the staff and crack up underneath the jaw,

2285
02:27:51,686 --> 02:28:00,276
snapping the neck the rest of the way, and it
falls to the ground, no longer moving. You still

2286
02:28:00,276 --> 02:28:01,968
have your movement.

2287
02:28:01,968 --> 02:28:10,176
MARISHA: Now I'm going to look around, and I'm
going to step back and into the house for just a minute.

2288
02:28:10,176 --> 02:28:11,623
SAM: Into the house?

2289
02:28:11,623 --> 02:28:13,830
TALIESIN: This is fine.

2290
02:28:13,830 --> 02:28:23,704
MARISHA: This is fine. Just so I have cover. Right
in the doorway.

2291
02:28:23,704 --> 02:28:26,455
TRAVIS: Just going to take a quick timeout.

2292
02:28:26,455 --> 02:28:27,605
MARISHA: Quick timeout.

2293
02:28:27,605 --> 02:28:30,646
SAM: There's a really loud ticking clock in the
room with you.

2294
02:28:30,646 --> 02:28:34,654
MARISHA: You hear a (faint scream) in the
distance.

2295
02:28:34,708 --> 02:28:38,606
MATT: With that, this gnoll is going to stand up.
Molly's on the wall.

2296
02:28:38,606 --> 02:28:40,054
TALIESIN: I know, I'm being an asshole.

2297
02:28:40,054 --> 02:28:42,879
MATT: It's okay. Stands up.

2298
02:28:42,879 --> 02:28:46,968
TALIESIN: Man, I'm normally the one with shaky
hands.

2299
02:28:46,968 --> 02:28:53,176
MATT: That's more because these walls are not the
most sturdy. There you go. Stands up to you. This

2300
02:28:53,176 --> 02:29:06,599
one is going to step forward into the way. This
one is going to join in there. Those three now in

2301
02:29:06,599 --> 02:29:15,914
visual range. These two are both going to take
shots at Jester. This one's going to take a shot

2302
02:29:15,914 --> 02:29:27,103
at Fjord. Two longbows aiming in your direction.
That's a 20 and a natural one. The second one

2303
02:29:27,103 --> 02:29:36,581
misses. You suffer eight points of piercing damage
as the arrow sinks right into your torso, right in

2304
02:29:36,581 --> 02:29:39,868
the stomach area, and pierces through. You catch
it with your hand, but it's still a few inches

2305
02:29:39,868 --> 02:29:45,477
into your actual midsection. Then there's the one
over here that turned around and sees you now

2306
02:29:45,477 --> 02:29:48,112
engaging with the current pack leader.

2307
02:29:48,112 --> 02:29:50,719
TRAVIS: But I'm a gnoll! Ah!

2308
02:29:50,719 --> 02:29:52,429
MATT: That's a 15.

2309
02:29:52,429 --> 02:29:53,991
TRAVIS: I'm just confused, that hits.

2310
02:29:53,991 --> 02:30:03,134
MATT: That's going to be six points of piercing
damage. This one now slams into the side of your

2311
02:30:03,134 --> 02:30:08,597
knee, and hits the meaty part, so thankfully it's
not locked in the bone or any of the joint, but it

2312
02:30:08,597 --> 02:30:12,030
hits you in the side and you buckle to that side
from the pain.

2313
02:30:12,030 --> 02:30:13,582
TRAVIS: Understood.

2314
02:30:13,582 --> 02:30:26,886
MATT: This guy over here is going to leap down and
begin helping push the cart.

2315
02:30:26,886 --> 02:30:28,849
ALL: No!

2316
02:30:28,849 --> 02:30:37,132
MATT: With that, the cart pushes another full 40
feet and is currently off of the board. Let me

2317
02:30:37,132 --> 02:30:38,812
mark it over here.

2318
02:30:38,812 --> 02:30:40,081
MARISHA: How do we feel about the cart?

2319
02:30:40,081 --> 02:30:41,340
LAURA: We got to get the cart!

2320
02:30:41,340 --> 02:30:43,954
SAM: I can take a shot at the cart, but what is
one arrow going to do?

2321
02:30:43,954 --> 02:30:46,569
TALIESIN: We can take out people pushing it.

2322
02:30:46,569 --> 02:30:53,013
MATT: That finishes the gnolls' turn there. Oh,
there's the one that's attacking Molly. It's going

2323
02:30:53,069 --> 02:30:58,802
to take its spear and attempt to two-hand strike
at you. That is cocked.

2324
02:30:58,802 --> 02:31:03,368
TALIESIN: Does he have a spear? I thought he had a
bow. Oh, he's got both.

2325
02:31:03,368 --> 02:31:04,991
MATT: 13 to hit, which I don't think hits.

2326
02:31:04,991 --> 02:31:06,388
TALIESIN: No, it does not hit.

2327
02:31:06,388 --> 02:31:12,806
MATT: You, on the wall, dance off the way, leap as
it goes up. All right, and I believe that's all

2328
02:31:12,806 --> 02:31:17,470
the gnolls immediately in the vicinity that are in
combat. That ends the gnolls' turn. Fjord, you're up.

2329
02:31:17,470 --> 02:31:24,511
TRAVIS: Yeah, great, awesome, sweet. Can I use
Eldritch Blast against the big fucking guy,

2330
02:31:24,511 --> 02:31:27,581
because he didn't get any closer for a melee
attack, right?

2331
02:31:27,581 --> 02:31:32,184
MATT: You're still within his attack range,
because he has the glaive. You do have

2332
02:31:32,184 --> 02:31:34,127
disadvantage on Eldritch Blast.

2333
02:31:34,127 --> 02:31:39,571
TRAVIS: Oh. Imma fucking move out of his attack
range. Does that give him attack of opportunity?

2334
02:31:39,571 --> 02:31:41,591
ALL: Yes.

2335
02:31:41,591 --> 02:31:45,237
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm doing that anyway. I'm going to
move back towards the corner where I was going.

2336
02:31:45,237 --> 02:31:46,382
MATT: Right there?

2337
02:31:46,382 --> 02:31:50,863
TRAVIS: No, all the way back. Back towards my
original hiding place.

2338
02:31:50,863 --> 02:31:57,128
MATT: You pull back to the corner there. As you
pull back, he takes a step forward and reaches out

2339
02:31:57,128 --> 02:31:59,100
with the glaive to try and strike you.

2340
02:31:59,100 --> 02:32:01,021
SAM: Does he have any disadvantage or anything?

2341
02:32:01,021 --> 02:32:02,903
MATT: Nope. That is a 23 to hit.

2342
02:32:02,903 --> 02:32:04,565
TRAVIS: That hits.

2343
02:32:04,565 --> 02:32:15,069
MATT: That is going to be ten points of slashing
damage. As you back away, arcs downward.

2344
02:32:15,069 --> 02:32:27,617
TRAVIS: I will now, out of his melee range,
Eldritch Blast. Ugh, God, that's not great. 13.

2345
02:32:27,617 --> 02:32:33,273
MATT: 13 does not hit. Now that it's seen the
Blast, after it strikes and grins you hear this

2346
02:32:33,331 --> 02:32:38,336
(hyena chuckle) under its breath. You turn around
and go to strike out with the Eldritch Blast, and

2347
02:32:38,336 --> 02:32:44,846
it pulls one of the other gnolls nearby and yanks
it in front of him, just as the shield takes it

2348
02:32:44,846 --> 02:32:48,467
off, then sets him back in place. Deflects it with
its own guy.

2349
02:32:48,467 --> 02:32:54,216
TRAVIS: Nice. As I'm pulling around the corner,
can I use my bonus action to drop the stupid,

2350
02:32:54,216 --> 02:32:56,045
runty gnoll look?

2351
02:32:56,045 --> 02:33:00,810
MATT: You don't have to spend a bonus action, you
just drop it. Pulling back from the fire, yeah,

2352
02:33:00,810 --> 02:33:03,725
you can get just around that corner. The guard
lets you by.

2353
02:33:03,725 --> 02:33:05,091
TRAVIS: I need cover.

2354
02:33:05,091 --> 02:33:14,116
MATT: That ends your turn. The leader at this
point makes this loud gibbering sound that echoes

2355
02:33:14,116 --> 02:33:21,525
throughout the alley, turns, and runs off to
pursue the cart.

2356
02:33:21,525 --> 02:33:22,892
SAM: He left!

2357
02:33:22,892 --> 02:33:26,549
TRAVIS: We're at level three, that's got to be an
acceptable option right now.

2358
02:33:26,549 --> 02:33:27,796
SAM: No!

2359
02:33:27,796 --> 02:33:30,211
LAURA: That means we almost killed him, that's
what that means! We almost had him.

2360
02:33:30,211 --> 02:33:31,790
MARISHA: Do we chase after him?

2361
02:33:31,790 --> 02:33:32,961
LAURA: Yeah.

2362
02:33:32,961 --> 02:33:36,594
MATT: That ends his turn. The guards now, who have
notched their crossbows again, are going to take

2363
02:33:36,594 --> 02:33:44,271
shots at both of those guys right there. Fucking
two. That does hit. The other one gets hit.

2364
02:33:44,271 --> 02:33:48,728
LAURA: Have we killed any of the gnolls-gnolls?

2365
02:33:48,728 --> 02:33:53,753
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's simple numbers. Them leaving is
a good--

2366
02:33:53,753 --> 02:33:55,530
MATT: Molly, you're up.

2367
02:33:55,530 --> 02:33:58,037
TALIESIN: I'm taking a slice at this guy again. I
don't have advantage anymore.

2368
02:33:58,037 --> 02:33:59,707
MATT: You do not. He is not prone anymore,
unfortunately.

2369
02:33:59,707 --> 02:34:03,031
TALIESIN: Slice number one. Oh, for fuck's sake.
Ten.

2370
02:34:03,031 --> 02:34:04,765
MATT: Ten does not hit, unfortunately.

2371
02:34:04,765 --> 02:34:08,306
TALIESIN: Slice number two. That hits, thank you!
23.

2372
02:34:08,306 --> 02:34:10,170
MATT: 23 will hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

2373
02:34:10,170 --> 02:34:19,325
TALIESIN: That's five points of damage and two
points of extra damage.

2374
02:34:19,325 --> 02:34:24,950
MATT: Radiant? All right. The first one, you swing
and it ducks out of the way, and attempts to

2375
02:34:24,950 --> 02:34:31,306
strike upward with its spear. As you do, you knock
it to the side, with the scimitar that missed, and

2376
02:34:31,306 --> 02:34:36,512
with your other hand, strike down right across its
face. You arc through and you actually carve one

2377
02:34:36,512 --> 02:34:40,504
of the eyes in twain. You see a large red mark
where you've split part of its face, and it's hurt

2378
02:34:40,504 --> 02:34:44,759
really bad, but it's still standing. There's gore
dripping out of the socket where its ruined eye

2379
02:34:44,759 --> 02:34:47,310
sits. (snarls)

2380
02:34:47,310 --> 02:34:53,387
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and circle around it to
get out of the way of the archers. I'm going to

2381
02:34:53,387 --> 02:34:55,188
hop back off and get behind him.

2382
02:34:55,188 --> 02:35:00,332
MATT: You can do that without a problem. You
leapfrog off of him, grab his shoulders, and land

2383
02:35:00,332 --> 02:35:04,678
behind him, scimitars at the ready. Okay, ending
Molly's turn. Jester, you're up.

2384
02:35:04,678 --> 02:35:06,184
LAURA: What about the guards?

2385
02:35:06,184 --> 02:35:09,975
MATT: The guards already went. Oh, she didn't
fire. Sorry, thank you for reminding me about

2386
02:35:09,975 --> 02:35:12,723
that. The other guards did go, she did not-- They
did not.

2387
02:35:12,723 --> 02:35:20,388
LAURA: Aren't they going to attack this skeleton
one that's right here next to both of us?

2388
02:35:20,388 --> 02:35:28,004
MATT: They throw their crossbow to the ground and
pull out a morningstar, and does a sideswipe

2389
02:35:28,004 --> 02:35:36,568
towards this-- That is a 19. We'll say that
straight up hits. That does five plus eight points

2390
02:35:36,568 --> 02:35:43,422
of damage to that one. I don't think you've
damaged that one yet, right?

2391
02:35:43,422 --> 02:35:46,034
LAURA: Yes I had. I did the Hellish Rebuke to it.

2392
02:35:46,034 --> 02:35:50,268
MATT: That's right, you did! That was the wrong
one. All right, with that, they swing backwards

2393
02:35:50,268 --> 02:35:54,790
with the mace and hit the side of the skeletal
head, which shatters immediately upon impact,

2394
02:35:54,790 --> 02:35:58,618
ruining its form, and is no longer part of the
battle.

2395
02:35:58,618 --> 02:36:00,479
LAURA: I am so surprised I fall off the wall!

2396
02:36:00,479 --> 02:36:02,278
MATT: You are. You tumble that way.

2397
02:36:02,278 --> 02:36:04,224
LIAM: Get out of the city!

2398
02:36:04,224 --> 02:36:07,899
MATT: All righty. Jester, your turn.

2399
02:36:07,899 --> 02:36:14,884
LAURA: Okay. Are either of those two gnolls over
there damaged?

2400
02:36:14,884 --> 02:36:19,247
MATT: From what you can tell, nope.

2401
02:36:19,247 --> 02:36:29,176
LAURA: Okay, well, I'm going to use my giant
lollipop, and it's going to swing and hit a couple

2402
02:36:29,176 --> 02:36:31,212
times and try to hit one like a bat.

2403
02:36:31,212 --> 02:36:32,749
MATT: Go for it.

2404
02:36:32,749 --> 02:36:35,994
LAURA: Okay, this is the one you licked.

2405
02:36:35,994 --> 02:36:37,216
SAM: Okay.

2406
02:36:37,216 --> 02:36:40,156
LAURA: Eight.

2407
02:36:40,156 --> 02:36:42,530
SAM: (sad trombone)

2408
02:36:42,530 --> 02:36:45,438
LAURA: Sam's spit: not a good luck charm.

2409
02:36:45,438 --> 02:36:50,576
MATT: As it swings in the air and spins, they both
take one step back and it hits the dirt, and they

2410
02:36:50,576 --> 02:36:52,967
both look at each other, and (chuckles).

2411
02:36:52,967 --> 02:37:01,725
LAURA: Shit. I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on
myself, and then I'm going to leap off the wall

2412
02:37:01,725 --> 02:37:10,712
with great flourish and land next to Caleb. Okay,
that's a good idea. I'm going to land next to the

2413
02:37:10,712 --> 02:37:16,280
guard. Then I'm going to skip away to the
building.

2414
02:37:16,280 --> 02:37:22,428
MATT: There you go. All righty. That ends Jester's
turn. Caleb, Nott, you're up.

2415
02:37:22,428 --> 02:37:29,695
LIAM: Okay, I'm just going to do my same dog and
pony show trick, I'm going to go to the corner, I

2416
02:37:29,695 --> 02:37:33,069
should be able to see two or three gnolls, I
think, over there, yeah?

2417
02:37:33,069 --> 02:37:34,362
MATT: Yes, over here.

2418
02:37:34,362 --> 02:37:40,015
LIAM: Okay, so (sizzling) starts to burn in my
hand, Chromatic Orb out to hit whichever one--

2419
02:37:40,015 --> 02:37:42,761
MATT: That one's probably the easiest to see right
now.

2420
02:37:42,761 --> 02:37:49,740
LIAM: Then that's the one I'm going to go for.
Come on. Oh, that's good. That's a 17.

2421
02:37:49,740 --> 02:37:50,938
MATT: That definitely hits.

2422
02:37:50,938 --> 02:37:51,979
LIAM: Thanks, Keyleth.

2423
02:37:51,979 --> 02:37:53,521
MARISHA: You're welcome, boo.

2424
02:37:53,521 --> 02:38:05,528
LIAM: That is 3d8, so where is my eight-sided die?
There it is. This is fire, and it is 11 points of damage.

2425
02:38:05,528 --> 02:38:13,215
MATT: As it bursts into it, you see the fur burn
and singe and (whimpers) pats it out and the

2426
02:38:13,215 --> 02:38:16,904
flames subside, you see it's charred and burnt,
and you see the flesh is cracked and blackened.

2427
02:38:16,904 --> 02:38:19,235
It's injured, but it's standing.

2428
02:38:19,235 --> 02:38:23,903
LIAM: Okay, and I inch back again and say,
(singing) If it ain't broke, don't fix it. And

2429
02:38:23,903 --> 02:38:25,360
hide behind the building.

2430
02:38:25,360 --> 02:38:26,743
MATT: That ends your turn. Nott?

2431
02:38:26,743 --> 02:38:30,778
SAM: There's two gnolls in front of me that I can
see, right?

2432
02:38:30,778 --> 02:38:34,934
MATT: You can see those down there. The one just
got blasted with the familiar fiery explosion of

2433
02:38:34,934 --> 02:38:37,312
Caleb's Chromatic Orb. The other is untouched.

2434
02:38:37,312 --> 02:38:48,293
SAM: The other one, I will point at and I will
remove a tiny rotten tart from my pocket and

2435
02:38:48,293 --> 02:38:59,394
crumple it onto the floor and take a feather and
move it around over the crumbs, and say: Hey, what

2436
02:38:59,394 --> 02:39:13,300
happens to a frog's wagon when it breaks down? It
gets toad away! And I will cast Hideous Laughter

2437
02:39:13,300 --> 02:39:15,413
on the gnoll.

2438
02:39:15,413 --> 02:39:17,315
TRAVIS: Hideous indeed.

2439
02:39:17,315 --> 02:39:20,708
MARISHA: No bad Halle Berry lines.

2440
02:39:20,708 --> 02:39:25,808
MARISHA and LAURA: What happens to a toad when
it's struck by lightning? The same thing that

2441
02:39:25,808 --> 02:39:27,980
happens to everything else.

2442
02:39:27,980 --> 02:39:32,821
MATT: Wisdom saving throw? That is a natural 11.
What is your spell DC?

2443
02:39:32,821 --> 02:39:33,826
SAM: 13.

2444
02:39:33,826 --> 02:39:35,215
MATT: 13. All right.

2445
02:39:35,215 --> 02:39:38,986
TALIESIN: I like the theory that he doesn't burst
into laughter, he just holds the groan pain.

2446
02:39:38,986 --> 02:39:46,204
LIAM: I would like to think that he does laugh
hideously and despises himself for it.

2447
02:39:46,204 --> 02:39:48,435
MATT: Did you shoot the one who was blasted with
the fire or the one that was untouched?

2448
02:39:48,435 --> 02:39:50,231
SAM: The untouched one.

2449
02:39:50,231 --> 02:39:54,949
MATT: You watch as the one that was currently
untouched that was drawing another arrow glances

2450
02:39:54,949 --> 02:40:01,239
up and hears, and goes, (uncontrollable laughter)
and falls to the ground. (manic laughter) Laughing

2451
02:40:01,239 --> 02:40:06,082
this horrible hyena chuckle, and it's billowing
out into the street, clutching its stomach and

2452
02:40:06,082 --> 02:40:10,345
dropping its weapons to the side and just rolling
on the ground. Its friend next to it is like, huh?

2453
02:40:10,345 --> 02:40:12,765
Looks up and sees you.

2454
02:40:12,765 --> 02:40:16,916
SAM: Okay. All right, I'll use my bonus action to
hide.

2455
02:40:16,916 --> 02:40:18,238
MATT: Go for it.

2456
02:40:18,238 --> 02:40:25,543
SAM: Oh, I have to stealth. Oh, God damn. Okay,
that's 13.

2457
02:40:25,543 --> 02:40:34,341
MATT: Okay. That ends your turn. There are no more
of the undead types, so they're off the thing.

2458
02:40:34,341 --> 02:40:35,762
Beau, you're up.

2459
02:40:35,762 --> 02:40:42,974
MARISHA: Okay, I step out of the burning building,
sauntering like a badass John Woo film.

2460
02:40:42,974 --> 02:40:45,970
LIAM: Doves go everywhere.

2461
02:40:45,970 --> 02:40:49,858
MATT: That's five feet of movement.

2462
02:40:49,858 --> 02:40:54,423
MARISHA: Yeah, and looking at this one, I go: Hey,
your friends have an inside joke without you.

2463
02:40:54,423 --> 02:41:00,887
Pointing at the guy on the ground. As soon as he
turns, I go whack like a baseball bat, right

2464
02:41:00,887 --> 02:41:02,367
across his head.

2465
02:41:02,367 --> 02:41:05,387
MATT: As soon as he glances over to the side, he
looks back just as you're already in his face.

2466
02:41:05,387 --> 02:41:06,927
MARISHA: Oh, that's good.

2467
02:41:06,927 --> 02:41:08,377
LIAM: Swing it high, Beau.

2468
02:41:08,377 --> 02:41:10,684
MARISHA: 25! No, sorry, 24!

2469
02:41:10,684 --> 02:41:12,756
MATT: 24, that'll definitely hit. Roll damage.

2470
02:41:12,756 --> 02:41:14,874
LIAM: Swing away.

2471
02:41:14,874 --> 02:41:22,722
MARISHA: I'm going to take that, that's a 13,
sorry, ten, nope, 11! Math.

2472
02:41:22,722 --> 02:41:26,182
MATT: 11 points of damage. Whack! You watch as
about five or six gnoll teeth go flying from the

2473
02:41:26,182 --> 02:41:32,428
impact, the jaw quivers as spittle and blood goes
careening off the side of the impact. It falls and

2474
02:41:32,428 --> 02:41:34,057
stumbles, if you want to follow it up.

2475
02:41:34,057 --> 02:41:40,468
MARISHA: I'm going to, using that momentum, do a
helicopter flourish above and go crack down over top.

2476
02:41:40,468 --> 02:41:42,065
MATT: Go for it.

2477
02:41:42,065 --> 02:41:44,699
MARISHA: That's a natural 19!

2478
02:41:44,699 --> 02:41:46,371
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

2479
02:41:46,371 --> 02:41:49,299
MARISHA: Oh, wait, this is technically an
off-handed.

2480
02:41:49,299 --> 02:41:52,020
MATT: Right, so it's a d4 for this one, but we're
using the staff for a flourish.

2481
02:41:52,020 --> 02:41:54,647
MARISHA: Ooh, that's a four, so eight points of
damage.

2482
02:41:54,647 --> 02:42:00,512
MATT: Eight points of damage. Wham! As you bring
it down over the top of the head, it falls and

2483
02:42:00,512 --> 02:42:06,404
gets up, it's dazed and beaten within an inch of
its life, it's ready to go. It's barely standing

2484
02:42:06,404 --> 02:42:11,163
at this point, one eye is lolling around and
trying to find, and the other one is swollen shut

2485
02:42:11,163 --> 02:42:14,067
now and can't actually see anything. It's in a bad
place.

2486
02:42:14,067 --> 02:42:16,064
MARISHA: Fuck. I'll hold.

2487
02:42:16,064 --> 02:42:27,951
MATT: Okay. That ends your turn, Beau. The guy on
the ground is just laughing his ass off. At the

2488
02:42:27,951 --> 02:42:32,375
end of its turn, it's going to try and make a
saving throw. No, that is a two. It is still

2489
02:42:32,375 --> 02:42:41,059
laughing on the ground. This one, seeing the rest
of its allies run, turns around and is just going

2490
02:42:41,059 --> 02:42:42,434
to run.

2491
02:42:42,434 --> 02:42:44,229
SAM: That's the one you just hit?

2492
02:42:44,229 --> 02:42:46,836
MARISHA: No. This here.

2493
02:42:46,836 --> 02:42:48,622
SAM: How many are over there? Oh, I didn't see
it.

2494
02:42:48,622 --> 02:42:49,925
TALIESIN: Two, and I've got one.

2495
02:42:49,925 --> 02:42:52,616
MATT: This one, seeing another one flee, is going
to attempt to try and flee after. You get an

2496
02:42:52,616 --> 02:42:53,925
attack of opportunity.

2497
02:42:53,925 --> 02:42:55,187
MARISHA: I have advantage on that?

2498
02:42:55,187 --> 02:42:56,153
MATT: You do not.

2499
02:42:56,153 --> 02:43:00,246
MARISHA: Fuck. Oh, but that's still good. 18.

2500
02:43:00,246 --> 02:43:01,713
MATT: That hits, roll damage.

2501
02:43:01,713 --> 02:43:02,722
LAURA: Kill him!

2502
02:43:02,722 --> 02:43:03,941
MARISHA: Is that with my regular attack?

2503
02:43:03,941 --> 02:43:04,979
MATT: Yes.

2504
02:43:04,979 --> 02:43:06,617
MARISHA: Eight damage.

2505
02:43:06,617 --> 02:43:11,114
MATT: You knock and crush him to the floor. As he
tries to run, you whack and hit him, and you watch

2506
02:43:11,114 --> 02:43:18,078
him take a few steps and skid and fall onto the
ground, and he's not moving. The one over here,

2507
02:43:18,078 --> 02:43:22,365
who is not currently in the process of knowing
that everyone else is fleeing, because he's been

2508
02:43:22,365 --> 02:43:24,990
stuck over here, is going to try to take a spear
attack at you, Molly.

2509
02:43:24,990 --> 02:43:31,227
TALIESIN: I'm going to snap at him. I'm going to
use Blood Maledict.

2510
02:43:31,227 --> 02:43:32,495
SAM: Hellish Snap.

2511
02:43:32,495 --> 02:43:34,857
MATT: Which is good, because he rolled a natural
20 on the first roll.

2512
02:43:34,899 --> 02:43:36,358
TALIESIN: Yeah, no he ain't.

2513
02:43:36,358 --> 02:43:38,697
MATT: Disadvantage, that brings him to a 15.

2514
02:43:38,697 --> 02:43:41,486
TALIESIN: That is my armor class.

2515
02:43:41,486 --> 02:43:42,788
MATT: So it just hits you.

2516
02:43:42,788 --> 02:43:46,101
LAURA: But at least it's not a critical attack.

2517
02:43:46,101 --> 02:43:47,081
TALIESIN: Nope!

2518
02:43:47,081 --> 02:43:50,360
LIAM: All his friends are running away, and he's
going, "Me and my friends are going to kill you."

2519
02:43:50,360 --> 02:43:59,536
MATT: Eight points of piercing damage. Its eyes go
dark and it pulls back, and still it seems its

2520
02:43:59,536 --> 02:44:04,928
sense of smell can still find your placement in
the vicinity, and as you pull out of the way, it

2521
02:44:04,928 --> 02:44:10,528
still manages to find you. The spear pierces right
around where the hip is, and you pull back,

2522
02:44:10,528 --> 02:44:13,527
gritting your teeth. That's going to end its go.

2523
02:44:13,527 --> 02:44:18,041
TRAVIS: My turn.

2524
02:44:18,041 --> 02:44:19,135
MATT: Yep.

2525
02:44:19,135 --> 02:44:21,338
TRAVIS: Can I hop around the corner again?

2526
02:44:21,338 --> 02:44:24,793
SAM: (engine revving) Start up the full.

2527
02:44:24,793 --> 02:44:36,802
TRAVIS: I'll go ahead and use my 30 speed to close in on
the proned-out. Great, and I'll use Eldritch Blast

2528
02:44:36,802 --> 02:44:38,148
against that.

2529
02:44:38,148 --> 02:44:41,771
MATT: All right, it has disadvantage against it
because it's prone.

2530
02:44:41,771 --> 02:44:43,444
TRAVIS: 11.

2531
02:44:43,444 --> 02:44:48,399
MATT: 11. As it's rolling around on the ground,
it's difficult to find a proper shot, and you

2532
02:44:48,399 --> 02:44:53,118
fire, and it hits the dirt next to it, sending a
bit of dust over it. It stops laughing for a

2533
02:44:53,118 --> 02:44:57,642
second as the dust-- He laughs even harder at the
actual dust.

2534
02:44:57,642 --> 02:44:59,668
TRAVIS: That's it. That's my turn.

2535
02:44:59,668 --> 02:45:07,155
MATT: That ends your turn. All right. The guards
go. The leader continues to run, and is now

2536
02:45:07,155 --> 02:45:11,065
disappearing into the smoke and ash. You don't
have a visual on the cart at the moment, it's now

2537
02:45:11,065 --> 02:45:16,060
pressed into where a lot of the fire is, and it's
obscuring their escape. These guards are going to

2538
02:45:16,060 --> 02:45:23,860
move forward as they load their crossbows, and
they're both-- actually, because he's on the

2539
02:45:23,860 --> 02:45:26,462
ground laughing, you're coming out on the roof,
they're going to turn and fire at the one that's

2540
02:45:26,462 --> 02:45:33,149
in front of Molly. It does have three-quarters
cover because of the wall. They're trying to help

2541
02:45:33,149 --> 02:45:34,258
you out.

2542
02:45:34,258 --> 02:45:35,995
TRAVIS: We need the assistance of guards, guys.

2543
02:45:35,995 --> 02:45:38,534
MATT: Hits the wall and deflects.

2544
02:45:38,534 --> 02:45:39,785
TRAVIS: It's hard.

2545
02:45:39,785 --> 02:45:44,713
MATT: That does hit! That is a 21, actually, so
that does, even with the bonus to armor class from

2546
02:45:44,713 --> 02:45:46,342
the three-quarters cover, it still hits.

2547
02:45:46,342 --> 02:45:49,532
SAM: Those guards are killing more than we are.

2548
02:45:49,532 --> 02:45:54,064
MATT: With that, as it's there in front of you
with its spear, after stabbing you, it pulls back

2549
02:45:54,117 --> 02:46:04,037
and one crossbow bolt out of its forehead. 
Its jaw goes slack and falls to the ground, dead.

2550
02:46:04,037 --> 02:46:05,787
TALIESIN: Oh, come on.

2551
02:46:05,787 --> 02:46:09,036
SAM: Don't you want to ask that nameless guard how
he wants to do this?

2552
02:46:09,036 --> 02:46:15,524
MATT: Well, there's still one left on the ground,
which we'll say for the purposes of narrative

2553
02:46:15,524 --> 02:46:17,733
here, who wants to do this?

2554
02:46:17,733 --> 02:46:21,256
TRAVIS: What, you really want to do something?

2555
02:46:21,256 --> 02:46:23,291
SAM: Is it our turn soon? Caleb and me?

2556
02:46:23,291 --> 02:46:24,351
LIAM: Yeah.

2557
02:46:24,351 --> 02:46:28,222
MATT: Well, when we come back around, it would be
Molly's turn, Jester, then Caleb and Nott. So

2558
02:46:28,222 --> 02:46:30,301
whatever you guys want to do in this moment before
it comes back, let me know.

2559
02:46:30,301 --> 02:46:40,010
SAM: I would like to jump down from the wall and
run as fast as I can after the leader and the cart.

2560
02:46:40,010 --> 02:46:41,211
TRAVIS: Really?

2561
02:46:41,211 --> 02:46:42,182
MARISHA and LAURA: Whoa!

2562
02:46:42,182 --> 02:46:43,717
MATT: Make an acrobatics check.

2563
02:46:43,717 --> 02:46:48,623
SAM: Oh, disadvantage. Jesus. 11.

2564
02:46:48,623 --> 02:46:54,442
MATT: You jump off the side and you land, you do
suffer four points of bludgeoning damage as you

2565
02:46:54,442 --> 02:46:58,637
hit the ground and your feet buckle, and you
actually slam and your face hits the dirt, but you

2566
02:46:58,637 --> 02:47:07,617
use your momentum to scurry back up, and beginning
to move forward, you get-- and if you're using the

2567
02:47:07,617 --> 02:47:08,855
rest of your--

2568
02:47:08,855 --> 02:47:09,956
SAM: Dash, everything.

2569
02:47:09,956 --> 02:47:11,175
MATT: I need you to make a concentration check, by
the way.

2570
02:47:11,175 --> 02:47:12,716
SAM: Oh.

2571
02:47:12,716 --> 02:47:15,824
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw, because
you did take--

2572
02:47:15,824 --> 02:47:18,787
SAM: This is a saving throw, that's not
disadvantage. 16.

2573
02:47:18,787 --> 02:47:24,322
MATT: Yeah, so you maintain control over the
Hideous Laughter. Okay. You rush into the cloud of

2574
02:47:24,322 --> 02:47:30,945
ash after them, and you begin to see some of the
shapes ahead of you of the gnolls there, pushing

2575
02:47:30,945 --> 02:47:36,037
the cart. You're still behind them by about 30 or
so feet, and right as you rush forward, darting

2576
02:47:36,037 --> 02:47:41,738
in, the heat from the embers entering your lungs
burn, and you put your mask over to block and help

2577
02:47:41,738 --> 02:47:45,767
filter a bit, with the cloth and bandages, and
right as you rush forward, you see the back of

2578
02:47:45,767 --> 02:47:52,597
the heavy armored leader, that's bringing up the
rear of where the cart is, and he turns and sees you.

2579
02:47:52,597 --> 02:47:53,977
SAM: Oh god.

2580
02:47:53,977 --> 02:48:01,200
MATT: As soon as you finish your movement, it
spins and looks in your vicinity, to see that

2581
02:48:01,200 --> 02:48:02,458
you're alone.

2582
02:48:02,458 --> 02:48:03,644
SAM: Oh god.

2583
02:48:03,644 --> 02:48:05,353
MATT: Takes his glaive.

2584
02:48:05,353 --> 02:48:06,325
SAM: Oh god!

2585
02:48:06,325 --> 02:48:08,235
MATT: And closes the distance with a giant
downward swing.

2586
02:48:08,235 --> 02:48:09,261
SAM: Oh god!

2587
02:48:09,261 --> 02:48:10,481
LAURA: What did you do?

2588
02:48:10,481 --> 02:48:13,906
TALIESIN: Wait, is it his turn already?

2589
02:48:13,906 --> 02:48:16,760
MATT: At this point? The narrative timing on
this.

2590
02:48:16,760 --> 02:48:19,161
TALIESIN: Because I was going to run that way too,
I thought we were still--

2591
02:48:19,161 --> 02:48:20,407
LAURA: Yeah.

2592
02:48:20,407 --> 02:48:22,568
MARISHA: Yeah, who was allowed to run?

2593
02:48:22,568 --> 02:48:23,841
MATT: Well, Nott's after you.

2594
02:48:23,841 --> 02:48:25,024
TALIESIN: Okay. So I will--

2595
02:48:25,024 --> 02:48:27,177
LAURA: But we didn't get to go, because Nott just
jumped it.

2596
02:48:27,177 --> 02:48:28,260
SAM: Yeah.

2597
02:48:28,260 --> 02:48:32,629
MATT: All right, cool. All right, well let's roll
it back a little bit here and see how this helps

2598
02:48:32,629 --> 02:48:36,462
you. All right, cool. So. No, it's fine. So
Jester, Molly, what are you guys doing?

2599
02:48:36,462 --> 02:48:39,067
TALIESIN: I was going to run to see where the cart
was going. Full dash.

2600
02:48:39,067 --> 02:48:48,607
MATT: Okay. As you sprint off, with a full dash,
you don't quite get as close as Nott does.

2601
02:48:48,607 --> 02:48:49,750
TALIESIN: No, I wouldn't.

2602
02:48:49,750 --> 02:48:52,693
MATT: Because Nott is much faster.

2603
02:48:52,693 --> 02:48:55,348
TALIESIN: Is he triggering my spider sense at
all?

2604
02:48:55,348 --> 02:48:56,394
MATT: No.

2605
02:48:56,394 --> 02:48:57,264
TALIESIN: Okay.

2606
02:48:57,264 --> 02:48:58,413
TRAVIS: What's your spider sense?

2607
02:48:58,413 --> 02:48:59,290
MATT: It's not really a spider sense.

2608
02:48:59,290 --> 02:49:00,302
TALIESIN: I know, but you know.

2609
02:49:00,302 --> 02:49:01,328
SAM: But it's a spider sense.

2610
02:49:01,328 --> 02:49:02,239
LAURA: Basically.

2611
02:49:02,239 --> 02:49:04,420
MATT: You're about that far back, I would say.

2612
02:49:04,420 --> 02:49:11,827
LAURA: I was going to have my duplicate go over
and touch the guy laughing on the ground, and cast

2613
02:49:11,827 --> 02:49:13,707
Inflict Wounds.

2614
02:49:13,707 --> 02:49:14,925
MATT: Go for it.

2615
02:49:14,925 --> 02:49:16,233
MARISHA: Dope.

2616
02:49:16,233 --> 02:49:20,996
MATT: It's a melee spell attack, correct? You have
advantage on it because he's currently

2617
02:49:20,996 --> 02:49:22,316
incapacitated.

2618
02:49:22,316 --> 02:49:25,034
LIAM: If he's still around when she's done, I
would have done my same single--

2619
02:49:25,034 --> 02:49:26,094
LAURA: Natural 20.

2620
02:49:26,094 --> 02:49:26,983
LIAM: Yeah!

2621
02:49:26,983 --> 02:49:29,569
TRAVIS: That'll be all the damage.

2622
02:49:29,569 --> 02:49:31,209
MATT: Oh my god. So roll the dice.

2623
02:49:31,209 --> 02:49:32,915
MARISHA: He's going to turn into powder.

2624
02:49:32,915 --> 02:49:35,190
LAURA: Five, six, 13, 26!

2625
02:49:35,190 --> 02:49:43,647
MATT: As he's laughing, your image walks up with a
skip, bends down and touches him, and he suddenly

2626
02:49:43,647 --> 02:49:51,570
withers into this completely dried-out husk of
what the gnoll once was, the life force drawn and

2627
02:49:51,570 --> 02:49:56,185
cast out of his body. He stops laughing, and the
body falls like a mummy to the ground.

2628
02:49:56,185 --> 02:50:00,458
SAM: Your duplicate can cast spells?

2629
02:50:00,458 --> 02:50:05,161
LAURA: Yeah. That's why it's more fun if I can move
her.

2630
02:50:05,161 --> 02:50:07,311
TALIESIN: That's why it's like a bear.

2631
02:50:07,311 --> 02:50:12,982
MATT: All right, finishing those turns, back to
the top of the round.

2632
02:50:12,982 --> 02:50:18,838
LIAM: No, I would have leaned out, if I had seen it
was dead, and no enemies, I would use my

2633
02:50:18,838 --> 02:50:22,780
movement, my action to move further up to the
corner, not much besides that, but join where

2634
02:50:22,780 --> 02:50:26,505
Fjord and the duplicate are. That's it.

2635
02:50:26,505 --> 02:50:28,167
MATT: That ends your turn.

2636
02:50:28,167 --> 02:50:30,510
TRAVIS: Your friend took off running.

2637
02:50:30,510 --> 02:50:32,398
LIAM: Nott?

2638
02:50:32,398 --> 02:50:36,091
LAURA: That's all happening right now.

2639
02:50:36,091 --> 02:50:37,535
LIAM: This is simultaneous.

2640
02:50:37,535 --> 02:50:38,991
MATT: Beau, your turn.

2641
02:50:38,991 --> 02:50:48,614
MARISHA: Hearing you say that, I'm going to be like,
I guess we're-- race you! I'm going to take off

2642
02:50:48,614 --> 02:50:49,939
running after Nott.

2643
02:50:49,939 --> 02:50:51,132
MATT: Okay.

2644
02:50:51,132 --> 02:50:54,285
MARISHA: 40 feet speed.

2645
02:50:54,285 --> 02:51:00,876
MATT: You manage to catch up right around
basically where Molly is there. Do you have a ki

2646
02:51:00,876 --> 02:51:01,888
point left?

2647
02:51:01,888 --> 02:51:02,836
MARISHA: I do.

2648
02:51:02,836 --> 02:51:04,125
MATT: If you wanted to use your--

2649
02:51:04,125 --> 02:51:11,440
MARISHA: That would just get me-- I'll save it for
right now. But I can see Nott, and I can see the

2650
02:51:11,440 --> 02:51:13,211
guy, and I can see the cart.

2651
02:51:13,211 --> 02:51:17,514
MATT: There's cloud and ash, embers pushing into
the atmosphere now, the nearby building are

2652
02:51:17,514 --> 02:51:19,771
actually in flames and engulfed on the side here.

2653
02:51:19,771 --> 02:51:21,138
MARISHA: That was a double move?

2654
02:51:21,138 --> 02:51:22,797
MATT: That was a double movement to get to there.

2655
02:51:22,797 --> 02:51:24,014
MARISHA: All right.

2656
02:51:24,014 --> 02:51:30,286
MATT: As you and Molly are 15, 20 feet from each
other, and ahead you can see the shape of Nott, and

2657
02:51:30,286 --> 02:51:35,334
you can see the leader of them. You can now see
from nearby buildings that about ten other gnolls

2658
02:51:35,334 --> 02:51:41,870
are all gathering around the cart and they're all
leaving. They're all carrying giant sacks on their back,

2659
02:51:41,870 --> 02:51:44,303
dragging bodies and corpses behind them.

2660
02:51:44,363 --> 02:51:45,580
MARISHA: Ten?

2661
02:51:45,580 --> 02:51:49,068
MATT: Yeah. This wasn't the only gnolls that
attacked the city.

2662
02:51:49,068 --> 02:51:53,227
TALIESIN: This was just our little patch. Our
gnoll patch.

2663
02:51:53,227 --> 02:52:02,827
MATT: Finishing Beau's turn, it comes back to
Fjord. The rest of the gnolls continue pushing the

2664
02:52:02,827 --> 02:52:08,180
cart. A few join them, giving it momentum.
About six more of them begin stepping up,

2665
02:52:08,230 --> 02:52:10,839
flanking the leader, who's now staring at the
three of you.

2666
02:52:10,839 --> 02:52:12,217
TALIESIN: Now's not the time!

2667
02:52:12,217 --> 02:52:17,345
TRAVIS: I'll run forward using my 30 feet but
I will call out: Nott, get back here!

2668
02:52:17,345 --> 02:52:23,324
SAM: What? Don't blow my cover.

2669
02:52:23,324 --> 02:52:24,821
TRAVIS: Let them go!

2670
02:52:24,821 --> 02:52:26,192
SAM: Okay. What?

2671
02:52:26,192 --> 02:52:33,723
MATT: That ends Fjord's turn. The leader sees the
three of you there, puts the glaive away with one

2672
02:52:33,723 --> 02:52:43,520
hand, turns around as he draws his longbow and
fires an arrow right at you. That is a 17 to hit?

2673
02:52:43,520 --> 02:52:44,973
SAM: Hits.

2674
02:52:44,973 --> 02:52:49,610
MATT: That is eight points of piercing damage.

2675
02:52:49,610 --> 02:52:52,596
MARISHA: Are you down?

2676
02:52:52,596 --> 02:52:54,112
TALIESIN: He is so down.

2677
02:52:54,112 --> 02:53:02,653
MATT: The arrow strikes Nott in the chest, who
falls unconscious onto the ground, the ash and

2678
02:53:02,653 --> 02:53:10,371
embers starting to spill over her unconscious
body. With that-- because I believe-- yeah, it can

2679
02:53:10,371 --> 02:53:14,177
make two attacks with its longbow. He's going to
make a second strike now. This one's going to be

2680
02:53:14,177 --> 02:53:22,132
at-- I'm going to make it-- He can't decide at the
moment. This'll be a four, Molly. That is a

2681
02:53:22,132 --> 02:53:23,825
natural 20.

2682
02:53:23,825 --> 02:53:25,417
(groaning)

2683
02:53:25,417 --> 02:53:36,557
MATT: That is 18 plus three. 21 points of
piercing damage.

2684
02:53:36,557 --> 02:53:38,176
TALIESIN: You got to be fucking kidding me,
really?

2685
02:53:38,176 --> 02:53:39,997
MATT: He rolled a nine on a d10. And it's a crit.

2686
02:53:39,997 --> 02:53:41,382
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm down.

2687
02:53:41,382 --> 02:53:42,956
MATT: Molly goes down.

2688
02:53:42,956 --> 02:53:44,186
SAM: Oh, shit.

2689
02:53:44,186 --> 02:53:50,716
MATT: With his movement, he puts the bow back away
and keeps walking with the rest of the gnolls.

2690
02:53:50,716 --> 02:53:55,882
MARISHA: I grab Fjord and I say, just wait. Wait.
Let them go.

2691
02:53:55,882 --> 02:54:03,147
MATT: You watch as all of them turn around and
they all begin to gather. You hear this cacophony

2692
02:54:03,147 --> 02:54:07,269
of different gibbering cries in the distance as
they're all starting to call themselves back to

2693
02:54:07,269 --> 02:54:13,053
leave the city. They all step into the clouds of
smoke and ash in the distance before eventually

2694
02:54:13,053 --> 02:54:15,523
all the shapes disappear.

2695
02:54:15,523 --> 02:54:20,752
MARISHA: I want to watch them as far as I can to
try and pinpoint a direction that they're heading in.

2696
02:54:20,752 --> 02:54:24,115
MATT: Okay, make a survival check in this moment.

2697
02:54:24,115 --> 02:54:25,349
LIAM: It's dark, too.

2698
02:54:25,349 --> 02:54:26,465
MATT: It is dark.

2699
02:54:26,465 --> 02:54:29,619
MARISHA: Not great, 11.

2700
02:54:29,619 --> 02:54:32,212
MATT: Okay. It's hard to tell with all the smoke,
you can't see the moon, you can't see the

2701
02:54:32,212 --> 02:54:36,325
placement of the sky, but you make a note of which
direction they're traveling based on the street.

2702
02:54:36,325 --> 02:54:42,379
Those who are both on the ground as Beau continues
doing this, you guys begin to rush up and you see

2703
02:54:42,379 --> 02:54:44,808
both Molly and Nott on the ground.

2704
02:54:44,808 --> 02:54:56,538
LAURA: I run up and I'll cast Cure Wounds on
Molly. Then I'm going to run over and do the same

2705
02:54:56,538 --> 02:55:01,249
thing at level two to Nott. That's six points of
healing for you, I'm sorry.

2706
02:55:01,249 --> 02:55:03,132
TALIESIN: Thank you.

2707
02:55:03,132 --> 02:55:11,811
LAURA: I'll run up and cast it on Nott. Oh no, Nott!
I pull her up into my lap. Oh, that's good. 13--

2708
02:55:11,811 --> 02:55:20,425
oh, 13 plus five! No, plus three.

2709
02:55:20,425 --> 02:55:25,094
MATT: That immediate first breath is filled with
pain, both from the wounds you've sustained and

2710
02:55:25,094 --> 02:55:31,140
the immediate influx of burning ash that sweeps
into your lungs. Both of you come to consciousness.

2711
02:55:31,140 --> 02:55:34,056
SAM: (gasping) Oh my gods!

2712
02:55:34,056 --> 02:55:36,190
TALIESIN: What were you thinking?

2713
02:55:36,190 --> 02:55:41,737
SAM: I was just going to follow them from afar. I
forgot they had bows and arrows.

2714
02:55:41,737 --> 02:55:44,293
TALIESIN: That's literally the only thing that's
been happening.

2715
02:55:44,293 --> 02:55:48,314
SAM: I thought they wouldn't see me because of the
smoke. Oh boy.

2716
02:55:48,314 --> 02:55:52,152
TALIESIN: I'm going to put out these fires. Oh,
I'm not getting up.

2717
02:55:52,152 --> 02:55:54,612
MARISHA: Ah shit, the town, you guys! And I'm going to
go back and start trying to put out the fires.

2718
02:55:54,612 --> 02:55:56,504
TALIESIN: I'm going to crawl back towards the--

2719
02:55:56,504 --> 02:56:00,869
MATT: As you guys begin to regather your troops,
more of the crownsguard that you see have been

2720
02:56:00,869 --> 02:56:05,665
battling and have been partially wounded by a lot
of the other gnolls are beginning to gather their

2721
02:56:05,665 --> 02:56:08,479
dead, beginning to try and put out what fires they
can and acknowledge which buildings can't be

2722
02:56:08,479 --> 02:56:14,355
saved. As you begin to take what remains of your energy to
do so, we're going to go ahead and take a break.

2723
02:56:14,355 --> 02:56:22,247
We're going to take a break here, and we'll have a
little denouement to this episode tonight. But

2724
02:56:22,247 --> 02:56:25,881
before I leave, we have another contest tonight.
Our friends at Wyrmwood actually have a pretty

2725
02:56:25,881 --> 02:56:33,885
cool giveaway tonight. As part of their new
Kickstarter, they have this all-inclusive package

2726
02:56:33,885 --> 02:56:44,333
here, which is both a dice box, with a leather
base, and on the inside here an all-inclusive

2727
02:56:44,333 --> 02:56:45,770
package for your dice.

2728
02:56:45,770 --> 02:56:46,921
SAM: We don't have those.

2729
02:56:46,921 --> 02:56:55,018
MATT: No, they just started producing them. These
are walnut Adventurer's Arsenal kits, and we're

2730
02:56:55,018 --> 02:57:01,795
giving away two of them. The keyword tonight is
map, M-A-P, based off last week's episode, thank

2731
02:57:01,795 --> 02:57:06,867
you Deven. During the break in Twitch chat only,
come in there and when you're prompted go ahead

2732
02:57:06,867 --> 02:57:10,692
and enter the keyword, map, into the chat only
once. More than once and you will be disqualified.

2733
02:57:10,692 --> 02:57:14,261
Two of you will be chosen during the break, and
we'll come back to see who wins that. See you guys here

2734
02:57:14,261 --> 02:57:15,729
in a few minutes.

2735
02:57:15,729 --> 03:12:04,874
[break]

2736
03:12:04,874 --> 03:12:10,531
MATT: Welcome back, everybody. That was on the
air, well done. The winner of the Adventure

2737
03:12:10,607 --> 03:12:19,818
Arsenals are, we have two of them, TheBravestKoala
and GrandmasterBlaq. Congratulations to both of

2738
03:12:19,818 --> 03:12:24,279
you guys for the win, go ahead and Danoba will
reach out to you and get your contact info and

2739
03:12:24,279 --> 03:12:27,648
we'll get those to you. For those of you who are
curious to look at it, this particular

2740
03:12:27,648 --> 03:12:33,351
Kickstarter you can find on wyrmwoodgaming.com
to look and see the cool thing this new release is

2741
03:12:33,351 --> 03:12:44,413
going to entail, so thank you very much, Wyrmwood.
All right, with some of the flames dying down, 30

2742
03:12:44,413 --> 03:12:49,778
minutes or so of the chaos descending, the
Crownsguard begin to come back, those that are

2743
03:12:49,778 --> 03:12:56,401
still living, many of them wounded and tending to
their wounds, or helping the survivors that are

2744
03:12:56,401 --> 03:13:01,909
still within the town. You see some families are
starting to unblock their entranceways and the

2745
03:13:01,909 --> 03:13:05,669
people who had escaped the city are slowly
beginning to filter in. You can hear the sobbing

2746
03:13:05,669 --> 03:13:11,280
in the distance of families that are coming back to
homes that have been destroyed. The smoke still

2747
03:13:11,280 --> 03:13:21,115
chokes the air, and at this hour now it's probably
pushing close to 11:00 or later. But as the guards

2748
03:13:21,115 --> 03:13:28,916
come through and begin to take in the essence of what's
happening, the armored individual that helped you

2749
03:13:28,916 --> 03:13:35,283
when you first arrived and gave you the command to
aid in this approaches. You see their half-elven

2750
03:13:35,283 --> 03:13:45,936
face, solemn and tense, approach and extend a
hand. "There aren't many who would immediately

2751
03:13:45,936 --> 03:13:54,192
"jump into the fray as you did. I would say that we
would have lost many more, and perhaps all of my

2752
03:13:54,192 --> 03:13:58,738
"men had you not been there, so thank you."

2753
03:13:58,738 --> 03:14:03,081
LAURA: Of course, I say as I cut off the ears of
some of the gnolls.

2754
03:14:03,081 --> 03:14:08,374
LIAM: You beat me to it. You said 30 minutes went
by, I wanted us to be doing that already.

2755
03:14:08,374 --> 03:14:11,700
MARISHA: We're like: Oh no, put out this fire!

2756
03:14:11,700 --> 03:14:14,871
LAURA: These people have lost everything!

2757
03:14:14,871 --> 03:14:18,397
LIAM: I was just waiting for you to pause.

2758
03:14:18,397 --> 03:14:23,586
MATT: Yeah, no worries. Unfortunately, for the
three skeletal ones you only manage to get one

2759
03:14:23,586 --> 03:14:24,567
full ear.

2760
03:14:24,567 --> 03:14:25,476
LIAM: That's fine.

2761
03:14:25,476 --> 03:14:27,720
LAURA: That's okay because we got two ears
off of all the other ones.

2762
03:14:27,720 --> 03:14:35,331
MATT: You did. We'll say for that, for those who
would've been destroyed or damaged, let me go

2763
03:14:35,331 --> 03:14:37,310
ahead and roll and see how many ears you're able to
pull off of those bodies.

2764
03:14:37,310 --> 03:14:39,931
LAURA: I'm also going pull off a chunk of tail and
see if it will pass.

2765
03:14:39,931 --> 03:14:48,854
LIAM: I'd like to think that we leaned down to the
same gnoll, cutting, and went, same hat? Same hat.

2766
03:14:48,854 --> 03:14:59,288
MATT: You manage to pull up about 12 ears intact
between all the fallen bodies. Some you killed,

2767
03:14:59,288 --> 03:15:03,133
some maybe you didn't. You came across the body
elsewhere in the square and just took the ear.

2768
03:15:03,133 --> 03:15:05,625
MARISHA: I totally remember kicking this guy's
ass.

2769
03:15:05,625 --> 03:15:08,794
MATT: Other guards are collecting them as they go
and there are a couple moments where someone was

2770
03:15:08,794 --> 03:15:14,002
going for an orc-- or a gnoll that you had killed
and you went to the guard and went, nuh-uh, and

2771
03:15:14,002 --> 03:15:21,388
they backed off. But anyway, the soldier head that was
speaking with you extends a hand and they say, "I

2772
03:15:21,388 --> 03:15:30,456
"am Watchmaster Bryce Feelid, assigned here to
Alfield, now in my fourth year. Thank you."

2773
03:15:30,456 --> 03:15:34,913
MARISHA: Watchmaster?

2774
03:15:34,913 --> 03:15:37,549
MATT: "Watchmaster Bryce Feelid."

2775
03:15:37,549 --> 03:15:43,311
TRAVIS: What were those creatures? Have you
encountered them before?

2776
03:15:43,372 --> 03:15:49,335
MATT: "We've encountered them before, yes, in
smaller hunting packs, maybe a half-dozen at a

2777
03:15:49,335 --> 03:15:55,055
"time, usually on the outskirts. They don't come to
civilization like this. It's generally too

2778
03:15:55,055 --> 03:16:01,388
"dangerous for them, in the smaller numbers they
travel. What the fuck are they after?"

2779
03:16:01,388 --> 03:16:05,359
TRAVIS: Such a grizzly scene, they seemed to be
carrying away bodies on that cart they had.

2780
03:16:05,359 --> 03:16:06,986
TALIESIN: That was weird.

2781
03:16:06,986 --> 03:16:09,904
LAURA: Did you notice they had some undead
gnolls with them?

2782
03:16:09,904 --> 03:16:10,952
TRAVIS: I did.

2783
03:16:10,952 --> 03:16:12,039
TALIESIN: There were.

2784
03:16:12,039 --> 03:16:13,831
LAURA: Have you ever seen anything like that?

2785
03:16:13,831 --> 03:16:19,957
MATT: "I've maybe crossed one or two as part of
the roving packs, it's not terribly uncommon."

2786
03:16:19,957 --> 03:16:25,176
TALIESIN: What turns them like that? Is there
something in the water?

2787
03:16:25,176 --> 03:16:31,170
MATT: "I have no idea. I don't know the ins and
outs of their creepy bestial lifestyle. I mean,

2788
03:16:31,170 --> 03:16:36,674
"what--" And you watch as they sit down for a
second, leaning against the wall, thinking and

2789
03:16:36,674 --> 03:16:41,925
scratching at their chin, "Word came of a small
hunting party of these beasts spotted to the

2790
03:16:41,925 --> 03:16:50,666
"south, so we sent a small troupe to slay them naught
but two hours before they struck here. We had sent

2791
03:16:50,829 --> 03:16:56,070
"more than half of our men's strength to go and
deal with them, so we were unprepared and, at the

2792
03:16:56,070 --> 03:17:07,128
"time, unguarded for the most part. We were caught
at half strength. It can't be a coincidence. They

2793
03:17:07,128 --> 03:17:13,435
"must be desperate to assault head-on
like this. There's plenty of small game in the

2794
03:17:13,435 --> 03:17:19,882
"surrounding wood and they're known to be provoked
to violence, but I've only heard of gnolls picking

2795
03:17:19,882 --> 03:17:23,019
"off the outlying folk, those that wander too far
from the fields."

2796
03:17:23,019 --> 03:17:25,352
LAURA: Do they eat the bodies?

2797
03:17:25,352 --> 03:17:32,362
MATT: "They eat what flesh they can get a hold of,
but we went through a number of the buildings and

2798
03:17:32,362 --> 03:17:41,560
"they've ransacked two of the inns. They completely
took the entire butcher's stock. They've carved

2799
03:17:41,560 --> 03:17:44,588
"the city of whatever meats, fresh or dried, we
had."

2800
03:17:44,588 --> 03:17:51,629
TALIESIN: Word came? Word came that they were in
the south? Where did word come from?

2801
03:17:51,629 --> 03:17:55,557
MATT: "Word came from some of our crownsguard who
were running a patrol."

2802
03:17:55,557 --> 03:18:01,727
LIAM: We have seen these things as far south as
Trostenwald. Further even.

2803
03:18:01,727 --> 03:18:07,718
MARISHA: Has there been something else going on,
that you can think of, that might have cut off

2804
03:18:07,718 --> 03:18:09,529
their food supply?

2805
03:18:09,529 --> 03:18:14,441
MATT: "Not that I can think of. For the most part,
this far south, other than a few run-ins here and

2806
03:18:14,441 --> 03:18:21,068
"there, they aren't-- conflicts of this size don't
make it past Bladegarden."

2807
03:18:21,068 --> 03:18:23,643
MARISHA: Bladegarden?

2808
03:18:23,643 --> 03:18:30,700
MATT: "It's where most of them-- It's where most
of the Empire's military and guard are trained and

2809
03:18:30,700 --> 03:18:39,188
"then sent out throughout the rest of the valley.
That's a lot of meat that they've acquired from

2810
03:18:39,188 --> 03:18:45,582
"us, and they've lost many, I thought, of their kin in
this battle as well."

2811
03:18:45,582 --> 03:18:49,161
LAURA: Too much meat. What are they feeding?

2812
03:18:49,161 --> 03:18:51,456
MATT: "Or what's making them so hungry?"

2813
03:18:51,456 --> 03:18:53,188
LAURA: Oh. Or that.

2814
03:18:53,188 --> 03:19:03,274
TRAVIS: Indeed. My concern is that they'll return.
We've fended them off for now, but they'll come back.

2815
03:19:03,274 --> 03:19:06,895
MARISHA: Especially if they're as desperate as you
say they are.

2816
03:19:06,895 --> 03:19:15,068
MATT: "I've sent three of our scouts to try and
find out where they went, track wherever they're

2817
03:19:15,068 --> 03:19:24,332
"taking their spoils. Reports come in that most of
the bodies they took were dead, perhaps not all.

2818
03:19:24,332 --> 03:19:31,474
"We have to do our best to at least recover any
survivors, wipe out what remains, and prevent this

2819
03:19:31,474 --> 03:19:33,175
"from ever happening again."

2820
03:19:33,175 --> 03:19:39,729
MARISHA: Have you heard local farmers complaining
about them stealing livestock? Missing livestock?

2821
03:19:39,729 --> 03:19:46,380
MATT: "I'm going to look into that, actually. I'm
sorry, I'm still gathering my thoughts."

2822
03:19:46,380 --> 03:19:50,538
LAURA: (gasps) W.C! I get up and I run and see if
our horse is still there.

2823
03:19:50,538 --> 03:19:51,763
MARISHA: Oh, W.C.

2824
03:19:51,763 --> 03:19:58,559
MATT: Okay, so you charge out to the far city and
you do find W.C., still affixed to the cart,

2825
03:19:58,559 --> 03:20:06,106
currently chewing on a small bag of oats where one
of the families of villagers who fled have come

2826
03:20:06,106 --> 03:20:07,827
back and begun to feed him.

2827
03:20:07,827 --> 03:20:15,372
LAURA: Thanks, man! Thumbs up to the family, I'll
run back to the group.

2828
03:20:15,372 --> 03:20:18,528
TRAVIS: Are you going to run back to the group, or
bring W.C. with?

2829
03:20:18,528 --> 03:20:20,059
LAURA: No, I'm going to leave it out there.

2830
03:20:20,059 --> 03:20:21,506
TRAVIS: Oh, cool, okay.

2831
03:20:21,506 --> 03:20:22,598
TALIESIN: Petting zoo.

2832
03:20:22,598 --> 03:20:24,197
LAURA: Yeah, they're petting him.

2833
03:20:24,197 --> 03:20:32,368
MATT: To the rest of you, Bryce says, "Well, as
rash as it was said-- and our coffers are not as

2834
03:20:32,368 --> 03:20:40,122
"strong as they could be, I will request more of a
monetary influx up north-- for the ears you have

2835
03:20:40,122 --> 03:20:45,031
"taken you will be paid. Any more that you find,
those will be paid as well."

2836
03:20:45,031 --> 03:20:49,960
TALIESIN: Well, and we're going to need some
lodging anyway, so perhaps some trade could be

2837
03:20:49,960 --> 03:20:52,672
worked out.

2838
03:20:52,672 --> 03:20:58,791
TRAVIS: Indeed, we could provide some extra
muscle, perhaps for some lodging while we stay and

2839
03:20:58,791 --> 03:21:03,037
maybe we could aid your men and their efforts to
exterminate this foe.

2840
03:21:03,037 --> 03:21:10,082
MATT: "Well, I would normally put you up in the
Candleglow Inn but--" They gesture over towards the

2841
03:21:10,082 --> 03:21:14,002
large building that you had walked through that's
now currently--

2842
03:21:14,002 --> 03:21:16,442
TALIESIN: It's literally glowing like a candle
right now.

2843
03:21:16,442 --> 03:21:19,297
MATT: "That is ironic now that you point it out."

2844
03:21:19,297 --> 03:21:21,461
TALIESIN: I feel really bad for saying that out
loud.

2845
03:21:21,461 --> 03:21:25,053
MATT: "Let's just not let Thadeus know that his
life is--"

2846
03:21:25,053 --> 03:21:29,652
LIAM: I have a question. After listening to this
for a while, I start looking around the town, would

2847
03:21:29,652 --> 03:21:34,140
you say that with all these burnt buildings
everywhere, that if I start picking through the

2848
03:21:34,140 --> 03:21:40,087
rubble I would find enough charcoal to reduce
the costs I would need for Find Familiar,

2849
03:21:40,087 --> 03:21:46,025
eventually? Because I still need the incense and
the herbs, but if I get a lot of charcoal from these

2850
03:21:46,167 --> 03:21:47,230
burnt homes--

2851
03:21:47,230 --> 03:21:51,577
MATT: I will say if you take 30 minutes to find
good pieces of charcoal, and roll an investigation check.

2852
03:21:51,577 --> 03:21:52,856
LIAM: Yeah.

2853
03:21:52,856 --> 03:21:53,770
TRAVIS: Nein.

2854
03:21:53,770 --> 03:22:00,470
LIAM: Yeah, done and done. That's good, and I have
a good investigation too. That is a 23.

2855
03:22:00,470 --> 03:22:04,796
MATT: All right, you manage to reduce the cost of
you next Find Familiar spell by three gold pieces.

2856
03:22:04,796 --> 03:22:05,966
LIAM: Yeah, good, that's good.

2857
03:22:05,966 --> 03:22:17,624
MATT: From the hopes and dreams of Alfield. So
Bryce looks at you. "I can have you put up at the

2858
03:22:17,624 --> 03:22:19,315
"Feed and Mead tavern."

2859
03:22:19,315 --> 03:22:20,468
SAM: Feed and Mead?

2860
03:22:20,468 --> 03:22:25,324
MATT: "Feed and Mead tavern. It's not the most
comfortable place, but it'll do."

2861
03:22:25,324 --> 03:22:26,890
MARISHA: It's a good name.

2862
03:22:26,890 --> 03:22:30,784
MATT: "I did not name it, but pass it on to Crute,
the owner."

2863
03:22:30,784 --> 03:22:32,341
TRAVIS: Crute?

2864
03:22:32,341 --> 03:22:38,255
MATT: "Tell him that Bryce sent you and you are
being put up by the Crown for as long as you are

2865
03:22:38,255 --> 03:22:40,690
"hunting these creatures."

2866
03:22:40,690 --> 03:22:48,915
TRAVIS: We appreciate that. Hopefully, there won't
be another call to action while they're here, but

2867
03:22:48,915 --> 03:22:51,054
you can count on us if there is.

2868
03:22:51,054 --> 03:23:03,762
MATT: "Of course. Well." They reach into a pouch
and begin to count out the gold for the number of

2869
03:23:03,762 --> 03:23:07,247
ears you've collected. With twelve ears--

2870
03:23:07,247 --> 03:23:08,601
LAURA: 360 gold.

2871
03:23:08,601 --> 03:23:09,613
MATT: Mm-hmm.

2872
03:23:09,613 --> 03:23:10,697
MARISHA: Dope.

2873
03:23:10,697 --> 03:23:16,413
MATT: After bringing the ears forward, they glance
over. "Actually, I'll be right back. I may need to

2874
03:23:16,413 --> 03:23:23,281
"acquire a bit more change." And after a brief
wait, Bryce returns and you are paid the full amount.

2875
03:23:23,281 --> 03:23:24,883
TRAVIS: Damn.

2876
03:23:24,883 --> 03:23:26,546
MATT: So 360 gold at your disposal.

2877
03:23:26,546 --> 03:23:28,427
SAM: Should we divvy it up equally?

2878
03:23:28,427 --> 03:23:33,986
LAURA: If we do, that's 60 gold apiece. That's
Laura talking.

2879
03:23:33,986 --> 03:23:36,141
(laughter)

2880
03:23:36,141 --> 03:23:37,530
MARISHA: I'm fine with that.

2881
03:23:37,530 --> 03:23:44,825
MATT: Bryce says, "We hope to hear back in the
morning of our scouts' findings. If you wish to,

2882
03:23:44,825 --> 03:23:54,187
"if you can hunt whatever remains of these
creatures and bring back proof that they've been

2883
03:23:54,187 --> 03:24:01,874
"wiped out, I'll see what I can have sent southward
of Zadash to make it worth your while."

2884
03:24:01,874 --> 03:24:08,347
MARISHA: In the meantime, you wouldn't have
anything that might help us and our little

2885
03:24:08,347 --> 03:24:15,159
expedition, would you? Healing potion might be
nice if you got one hiding away somewhere in a

2886
03:24:15,159 --> 03:24:16,654
closet, forgotten.

2887
03:24:16,654 --> 03:24:26,261
MATT: "I don't mean to be brusque, but at the
moment I think we have a number of our guard who

2888
03:24:26,261 --> 03:24:28,369
"are in more desperate need."

2889
03:24:28,369 --> 03:24:30,308
MARISHA: Fair.

2890
03:24:30,308 --> 03:24:34,313
LAURA: I can help them... in the morning.

2891
03:24:34,313 --> 03:24:36,167
(laughter)

2892
03:24:36,167 --> 03:24:44,164
MATT: "I'm sure that would be appreciated. For the
moment, you all look about as battered as I feel. Rest

2893
03:24:44,164 --> 03:24:58,222
"up, come--" Let's see, they would be at-- "Meet me
outside of the Broad Barn."

2894
03:24:58,222 --> 03:25:00,763
SAM: The "Rod Bawn"?

2895
03:25:00,763 --> 03:25:02,223
MATT: "The Broad Barn."

2896
03:25:02,223 --> 03:25:03,249
LAURA: The broad?

2897
03:25:03,249 --> 03:25:04,528
MATT: Barn. Broad Barn.

2898
03:25:04,528 --> 03:25:14,681
They point it out to you, it's on the
western side of the town. "There, we'll make sure

2899
03:25:14,681 --> 03:25:20,453
"you get the basic supplies necessary. Hopefully,
we'll have information on where to go, and if you

2900
03:25:20,453 --> 03:25:31,130
"so choose, we could conscribe you to be under our
intent to destroy these creatures. Think on it,

2901
03:25:31,130 --> 03:25:37,758
"rest, we'll speak in the morning." Bryce turns
around and limps off with a few of the other

2902
03:25:37,758 --> 03:25:47,422
crownsguard. As you guys eventually find your way
to the Feed and Mead, you are immediately met by

2903
03:25:47,422 --> 03:25:58,653
Crute, who is this ornery, salty-looking dwarf of
tousled white-gray hair, this single tuft of a

2904
03:25:58,653 --> 03:26:05,747
beard that dangles down towards the belly button
before it hits a ring of gold, goes, "Oh, so I've

2905
03:26:05,747 --> 03:26:10,915
"been told you're the ones who were coming to
sleep. Got one of our two rooms for you."

2906
03:26:10,915 --> 03:26:12,464
SAM: One?

2907
03:26:12,464 --> 03:26:15,971
MATT: He never quite makes eye contact with you.
He's looking at your shoulder, or right above your face.

2908
03:26:15,971 --> 03:26:19,462
SAM: I think he's got two glass eyes.

2909
03:26:19,462 --> 03:26:27,864
MATT: "Come, I'll show you." Turns around and
leads you to your space. There are four beds

2910
03:26:27,864 --> 03:26:35,205
jammed in here. It's like a youth hostel-type
living situation here, but it's functional.

2911
03:26:35,205 --> 03:26:38,224
LAURA: Are they doubles? Fulls? Queens? Twins?

2912
03:26:38,224 --> 03:26:42,758
MATT: They are pretty much as twin bed as you can
get.

2913
03:26:42,758 --> 03:26:47,313
MARISHA and TALIESIN: I'm fine with the floor.

2914
03:26:47,313 --> 03:26:50,158
TRAVIS: I'm great with a bed.

2915
03:26:50,158 --> 03:26:57,430
LIAM: I've already got the silver thread out and I
am looping it over any open window and by the door.

2916
03:26:57,430 --> 03:26:59,864
TALIESIN: Was there beer downstairs? Was there
ale?

2917
03:26:59,864 --> 03:27:01,097
MATT: You can go ask.

2918
03:27:01,097 --> 03:27:04,162
TALIESIN: I'm going to drop my things and run
downstairs.

2919
03:27:04,162 --> 03:27:09,098
MATT: Okay. You come downstairs and there's nobody
inside, this is not a tavern night for a lot of

2920
03:27:09,098 --> 03:27:12,044
people. "Right, can I help you?"

2921
03:27:12,044 --> 03:27:15,060
TALIESIN: Is there drink? Is there smoke?

2922
03:27:15,060 --> 03:27:19,980
MATT: "Smoke we don't have. But drink, that I can
give you."

2923
03:27:19,980 --> 03:27:22,043
TALIESIN: I'll take something interesting.

2924
03:27:22,043 --> 03:27:30,675
MATT: "Interesting, you say. Heh." Takes out a
bottle, looks like a deep green glass, and uncorks

2925
03:27:30,675 --> 03:27:39,526
it. Takes a small shot glass that has a bulbous
bottom, pours it to the very top with this liquid

2926
03:27:39,526 --> 03:27:46,582
that looks a deep sea-teal green, and slides
it forward.

2927
03:27:46,582 --> 03:27:48,162
TALIESIN: Fast or slow?

2928
03:27:48,162 --> 03:27:49,904
MATT: "Well, depends on how much you like to
dream."

2929
03:27:49,904 --> 03:27:52,446
TALIESIN: How much?

2930
03:27:52,446 --> 03:27:56,175
MATT: "For that, and for what I heard you did,
it's on the house."

2931
03:27:56,175 --> 03:27:57,859
TALIESIN: Nonsense.

2932
03:27:57,859 --> 03:28:01,905
MATT: "For the night. You want more, you're paying
top-shelf price."

2933
03:28:01,905 --> 03:28:03,328
TALIESIN: What's top-shelf price?

2934
03:28:03,328 --> 03:28:07,494
MATT: "For that drink there, that would run you
about three silver."

2935
03:28:07,494 --> 03:28:10,219
TALIESIN: I put a gold on the table.

2936
03:28:10,219 --> 03:28:11,860
MATT: "Not going to complain."

2937
03:28:11,860 --> 03:28:16,133
TALIESIN: Consider it an advance, it's been a
rough night for everybody."

2938
03:28:16,133 --> 03:28:17,531
MATT: "Right, right, of course."

2939
03:28:17,531 --> 03:28:19,264
TALIESIN: And I'm going to sip this mother.

2940
03:28:19,264 --> 03:28:31,498
MATT: It has a very smoky, oak-barrel flavor to it
at first as it hits your tongue and then it burns

2941
03:28:31,498 --> 03:28:38,968
into this very medicinal, herbal, almost anise
mixed with burnt charcoal.

2942
03:28:38,968 --> 03:28:45,157
TALIESIN: That sounds nice. I'm going to sit, and
sip this, and grin, and very silently have a mild

2943
03:28:45,157 --> 03:28:47,296
nervous breakdown about what just went down.

2944
03:28:47,296 --> 03:29:02,651
MATT: Okay. As you all slowly come to rest,
exhausted, sore, beaten, trying to fall asleep to

2945
03:29:02,651 --> 03:29:05,661
the distant muffled sound of shouts and wailing in
the streets--

2946
03:29:05,661 --> 03:29:08,184
LAURA and MATT: And Jester jumping on the bed.

2947
03:29:08,184 --> 03:29:09,881
TRAVIS: Jester!

2948
03:29:09,881 --> 03:29:14,538
MATT: You find yourself to rest, preparing for
what the morning may hold, and that's where we're

2949
03:29:14,538 --> 03:29:16,146
going to pick up for next week's session.

2950
03:29:16,146 --> 03:29:19,205
LAURA: Worst roommate ever.

2951
03:29:19,205 --> 03:29:28,317
LIAM: You're not the only one. Caleb is going: one
gold, two gold, three gold, 60 gold.

2952
03:29:28,317 --> 03:29:30,089
LAURA: 60 gold, Caleb!

2953
03:29:30,089 --> 03:29:31,648
LIAM: This was a good idea.

2954
03:29:31,648 --> 03:29:35,595
TALIESIN: This is working out weirdly, I'm
excited.

2955
03:29:35,595 --> 03:29:36,863
MARISHA: We all have an extra 60 gold, yeah?

2956
03:29:36,863 --> 03:29:40,702
LAURA: For all the work that Beau did.

2957
03:29:40,702 --> 03:29:42,467
(laughter)

2958
03:29:42,467 --> 03:29:48,509
MATT: That was some Jackie Chan shit. You were in
the doorway, dodging everything.

2959
03:29:48,509 --> 03:29:52,610
TALIESIN: We now need to have a Stephen Chow
night, that was some crazy shit.

2960
03:29:52,610 --> 03:29:55,346
LIAM: We are hitching out stars to your wagon.

2961
03:29:55,346 --> 03:29:57,466
(laughter)

2962
03:29:57,466 --> 03:30:01,391
LIAM: She just shot some Sun Chip out of her
mouth. You're welcome, internet!

2963
03:30:01,391 --> 03:30:04,247
MATT: Gif that.

2964
03:30:04,247 --> 03:30:08,199
MARISHA: Oh, there it is, I found it.

2965
03:30:08,199 --> 03:30:09,585
SAM and LAURA: (groan)

2966
03:30:09,585 --> 03:30:14,108
MATT: Waste not, want not. That's my wife, ladies
and gentlemen. Thank you guys so much. Thank you

2967
03:30:14,108 --> 03:30:19,394
guys for watching. Thank you, D&amp;D Beyond, I'm
learning more and more about the app and I'm

2968
03:30:19,394 --> 03:30:22,976
enjoying it, thank you for supporting the show.
Thank you all for joining us tonight, we'll see

2969
03:30:22,976 --> 03:30:25,908
you next week, and is it Thursday yet?

2970
03:30:25,908 --> 03:30:26,926
LIAM: Nein!

2971
03:30:26,926 --> 03:30:28,469
MATT: Good night, everybody.
