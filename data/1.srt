1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,354
MATT: Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,354 --> 00:00:03,170
(laughter)

3
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:07,071
MATT: And welcome to tonight's episode of Critical
Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

4
00:00:07,071 --> 00:00:12,030
sit around and play the first game of our new
campaign of Dungeons and Dragons.

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,002
(cheering)

6
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:21,294
MATT: Super excited to be back. I've missed this a
lot. Missed this-- oh, you guys will be fine. So

7
00:00:21,294 --> 00:00:29,227
yes. Glad you guys can join us, apparently in some
crazy numbers. So welcome new viewers. Hope you

8
00:00:29,227 --> 00:00:33,564
enjoy your stay. So, without further ado, let's
get this going so we can get through our

9
00:00:33,564 --> 00:00:36,496
announcements. Since it is our first episode of
the year, of the campaign, I want to make sure

10
00:00:36,496 --> 00:00:40,099
that we get our announcements out of the way.
We've got some cool stuff to talk about. First and

11
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:48,701
foremost, we have two sponsors tonight. Our first
sponsor-- and we're going into, for a time, a cool

12
00:00:48,701 --> 00:00:55,204
partnership with the folks at DnD Beyond,
actually. They've been really awesome, and we've

13
00:00:55,204 --> 00:00:59,954
been talking, and anybody who hasn't seen it, it's
an online digital tool where you can create your

14
00:00:59,954 --> 00:01:05,851
own D&D character, they have options to purchase
any of the current D&D books out there, and then

15
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:10,240
carry over any of the character options and racial
options over into it, so you can basically use it

16
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,842
as a tool. We'll be using it to help us out in the
game as we go, 'cause it's actually got some pretty

17
00:01:13,842 --> 00:01:20,262
cool stuff. So excited about that. It is D-N-D
Beyond, by the way, if you haven't seen, not the

18
00:01:20,316 --> 00:01:21,948
ampersand. It's D-N-D.

19
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:24,704
LAURA: As in nnnn.

20
00:01:24,704 --> 00:01:29,468
MATT: Nnnn. But yeah, so they're going to be a
long-term partner for the show, so working with us

21
00:01:29,468 --> 00:01:35,864
through the start of this campaign. We're super
excited. But yeah. So we're excited. You can

22
00:01:35,864 --> 00:01:42,182
currently activate-- it should be now-- some
Critical Role content on there. They should have

23
00:01:42,182 --> 00:01:48,754
available the Blood Hunter class that I created a
couple of years ago, kind of refining. Should be

24
00:01:48,754 --> 00:01:53,204
available for you guys to find on the DnD Beyond,
which I'm excited about, and there's a one-time

25
00:01:53,204 --> 00:01:58,227
discount of $10 off any digital book in the
dndbeyond.com marketplace if you use the codeword

26
00:01:58,227 --> 00:02:04,352
'beginnings' in there right now. So yeah, get a
chance to check it out.

27
00:02:04,352 --> 00:02:07,321
TRAVIS: (vomiting noises) Would you like some?

28
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:14,495
MATT: So yeah. I'm super excited to have that,
guys. So you apply that code at checkout to make

29
00:02:14,495 --> 00:02:19,738
that happen, in case you're confused and trying to
get it to work. There's a bunch of stuff to

30
00:02:19,738 --> 00:02:25,388
explore on there, and a bunch of cool ways to
incorporate the existing breadth of D&D lore and

31
00:02:25,388 --> 00:02:29,317
options in there, and now you have some of our stuff in
there as well, and hopefully more Critical Role

32
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:34,053
content and Tal'Dorei content and Exandria content
down the road to also be available on there as we

33
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:40,828
go. Super excited about that. I'd like to thank
you guys at DnD Beyond for being awesome. We also

34
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,529
have our second sponsor. Sam, if you want to take
it away.

35
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:43,898
SAM: I'm our second sponsor.

36
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:45,202
(laughter)

37
00:02:45,202 --> 00:02:46,152
LAURA: Thanks, Sam!

38
00:02:46,152 --> 00:02:52,577
SAM: No. Welcome, new viewers. Every week-- or
many weeks, I am charged with writing the ad for

39
00:02:52,577 --> 00:02:59,633
the sponsor of that week. I did this one way back
in mid-December, so it'll feel a little stale.

40
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:03,965
(laughter)

41
00:03:03,965 --> 00:03:12,335
SAM: Sorry. I didn't have time to write a new one.
Apologies to our sponsor. But our second sponsor

42
00:03:12,335 --> 00:03:19,078
tonight is Backblaze. They offer unlimited cloud
backup for Macs and PCs. You can restore from the

43
00:03:19,078 --> 00:03:24,252
web or via hard drive. They'll even overnight
FedEx a drive to you, and because it's Christmas

44
00:03:24,252 --> 00:03:32,472
season, I wrote this. 'Twas the night before
Critmas when I clicked on my mouse, but the drive

45
00:03:32,472 --> 00:03:39,907
wasn't whirring; it had said 'Adi-ouse'. When up
from the cloud there arose such a sight, I knew in

46
00:03:39,907 --> 00:03:45,792
a flash that my shit was all right. As I spat out
my plate of cold chicken kiev, down my chimney

47
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:52,589
came a weird little elf named Lev. I said, "Whoa,
whoa, whoa, how'd you get in my place?" Lev gave

48
00:03:52,589 --> 00:03:57,696
me a wink and punched me in the face. And suddenly
he fired up a pipe and started to restore my

49
00:03:57,696 --> 00:04:03,690
computer from a backup he carted. My documents,
like slash fiction from My Little Pony. My photos,

50
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:09,699
like me naked, covered in bologna. He mumbled that
you can get backed up at once for a merry little

51
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:20,565
fee of $5 a month-s. You even get 15 days free if
you scroll over to backblaze.com/criticalrole. And

52
00:04:20,565 --> 00:04:26,631
just like that, my computer was on. Lev greased up
his body, and bam, he was gone. But I heard him

53
00:04:26,631 --> 00:04:32,034
exclaim, "Peace out, yo, whassup! Happy Backblaze
to all, don't forget to back up!"

54
00:04:32,034 --> 00:04:35,725
(cheering)

55
00:04:35,725 --> 00:04:37,564
SAM: I'll write another one for Easter, I
promise.

56
00:04:37,564 --> 00:04:39,629
(laughter)

57
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:44,573
MATT: Thank you, Sam. So thank you, Backblaze.
Happy to have you for our sponsor tonight as well.

58
00:04:44,573 --> 00:04:49,755
Also, as a heads-up, we've had our friends at
Wyrmwood for a while have been awesomely providing

59
00:04:49,755 --> 00:04:55,595
Wyrmwood dice boxes and dice trays and dice towers
to give away to people in the community. They have

60
00:04:55,595 --> 00:05:00,295
new boxes for all the players in the new campaign.
And they have been working on something for a

61
00:05:00,295 --> 00:05:05,828
while for us to kick off the new campaign. They
made us a new table. If we can go to a camera view

62
00:05:05,828 --> 00:05:07,675
of this table they made for the campaign.

63
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:12,287
(cheering)

64
00:05:12,287 --> 00:05:17,864
MATT: It's made out of English brown oak, the
center Critical Role inlay is made of ash burl, is

65
00:05:17,864 --> 00:05:24,592
the background, and then rosewood for the d20
outline, wenge for the Critical Role words

66
00:05:24,592 --> 00:05:28,691
themselves, and silver stringing around the
border. It was built by hand in their

67
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:34,210
Massachusetts office and workshop, and it was
hand-rubbed oil on a wax finish. Over a hundred

68
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,992
hours were put into this table. They did an
incredible job, and we're super honored to have

69
00:05:37,992 --> 00:05:42,959
that here, and thank you guys for showing such an
awesome appreciation for what we do.

70
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,258
SAM: It smells really nice.

71
00:05:46,258 --> 00:05:48,341
LAURA: We have cubbies!

72
00:05:48,341 --> 00:05:50,905
MARISHA: It smells like wood in the studio, like
fresh wood.

73
00:05:50,905 --> 00:05:54,201
SAM: And, when we get canceled, this is going to
be a great dining room table.

74
00:05:54,201 --> 00:05:59,994
MATT: This is true! Thank you guys, Wyrmwood. If
you aren't familiar with any of their stuff, go to

75
00:05:59,994 --> 00:06:05,052
wyrmwoodgaming.com, that's W-Y-R-M-wood Gaming 
dot com. They do awesome work. It's really super

76
00:06:05,052 --> 00:06:10,933
high-quality, it's great. So thank you guys. All
right, so. Let's see. Updates we can get through.

77
00:06:10,933 --> 00:06:13,670
Laura, do you have an update for merch stuff in
the new year?

78
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:20,823
LAURA: (yells) Okay. Yes, I do. It's a new
campaign, new us, new merch. I don't know which

79
00:06:20,823 --> 00:06:22,678
camera I'm looking at.

80
00:06:22,678 --> 00:06:24,361
SAM: That one.

81
00:06:24,361 --> 00:06:31,514
LAURA: So we released our teaser on socials, and
everybody was like, "I want that as a poster!" So

82
00:06:31,514 --> 00:06:35,021
we listened to you, and we made it a poster!

83
00:06:35,021 --> 00:06:38,128
(cheering)

84
00:06:38,128 --> 00:06:39,176
SAM: It's a real poster?

85
00:06:39,176 --> 00:06:40,216
LAURA: It's a real poster!

86
00:06:40,216 --> 00:06:41,392
SAM: Oh, wow!

87
00:06:41,392 --> 00:06:47,039
LAURA: Look at this lameness that you could have
on your wall! So yeah. It's in the store right

88
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,629
now, you guys, and we printed a small amount, so
those ones will be shipped faster, and then after

89
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:56,159
that it'll just be pre-order, but I think it's all
listed as pre-order, so just so you know.

90
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:59,389
SAM: Can you photoshop out my crotch region?

91
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:00,602
LAURA: No.

92
00:07:00,602 --> 00:07:02,340
TALIESIN: That would be a lot of photoshop, man.

93
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,110
MATT: None of us have that much talent in post,
Sam.

94
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,907
LAURA: But let's just talk about this Matthew
Mercer.

95
00:07:06,907 --> 00:07:11,606
MATT: Let's not talk about what I-- when I put
that outfit on, I did not consider quite the

96
00:07:11,606 --> 00:07:16,633
permeation in my life it would become. So there's
that.

97
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:22,146
LAURA: So we can be with you always. Matt can
stare at you while you sleep.

98
00:07:22,146 --> 00:07:23,945
LIAM: That's actually how Purvon dressed.

99
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:25,446
MATT: God damn it.

100
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:27,969
TALIESIN: Hey, first throwback! Well done.

101
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:31,501
LAURA: Oh yeah. We've got to be careful, guys,
because we have a lot of people that haven't

102
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:36,146
watched the last campaign, or haven't finished the
last campaign, so no spoilers for last campaign.

103
00:07:36,146 --> 00:07:37,689
SAM: I don't really remember it.

104
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:38,928
TRAVIS: Well, we all died, so.

105
00:07:38,928 --> 00:07:44,035
MATT: That's true, yeah. Okay, next announcements:
the Critical Role podcast we have currently up to

106
00:07:44,035 --> 00:07:50,737
date. All of Vox Machina's story, the whole first
campaign, is now on the podcast. You can find it

107
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:57,207
where the finest podcasts are downloaded. And do
we have an update as far as the release schedule

108
00:07:57,207 --> 00:07:58,378
for this podcast?

109
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:07,572
MARISHA: Yes, we do. They will be releasing one
week after we are live. We'll be one week behind.

110
00:08:07,572 --> 00:08:09,432
SAM: On a Thursday?

111
00:08:09,432 --> 00:08:11,993
MARISHA: They will be releasing on Thursdays the
week after.

112
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:20,123
LAURA: Oh, so you can listen to it in the morning
and watch it live at night. If you have a lot of

113
00:08:20,123 --> 00:08:24,378
free time. Or a really long drive, maybe.

114
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:28,265
SAM: An extra eight hours to spend every
Thursday.

115
00:08:28,265 --> 00:08:33,401
MATT: To be fair, you guys would have about as
much free time on a Thursday as I would. Cool, so

116
00:08:33,401 --> 00:08:39,260
look forward to that. Comic book, issue four of
Critical Role: Vox Machina Origins, Liam, when

117
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,218
does that come out?

118
00:08:40,218 --> 00:08:42,120
LIAM: It is coming out on the 24th of this month.

119
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,534
TRAVIS: Oh, make it sooner!

120
00:08:43,534 --> 00:08:49,577
LIAM: I've read it. It's so good, it's real good,
it's so good. You guys, Vox Machina's story ended

121
00:08:49,577 --> 00:08:53,805
at this table, but it is going to live on and on
and on-- at least for three more issues.

122
00:08:53,805 --> 00:08:57,440
MATT: Thank you very much.

123
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,957
TRAVIS: Check it out everywhere.

124
00:08:58,957 --> 00:09:09,534
LIAM: Yeah, on Zune, on PalmPilot. Darkhorse app,
Comixology, Limewire, finally.

125
00:09:09,534 --> 00:09:13,124
MARISHA: Napster.

126
00:09:13,124 --> 00:09:15,708
LAURA: I'm going to throw up.

127
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:19,727
MATT: That's okay, guys, we've got a couple more
things left. Thank you for hanging in there. As

128
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:23,936
far as con appearances go, I actually fly tomorrow
to Miami, Florida for Paradise City Comic Con.

129
00:09:23,936 --> 00:09:28,765
I'll be there tomorrow until Sunday. If you guys
are in the area, come say hi at the convention. It

130
00:09:28,765 --> 00:09:33,366
should be fun. I have panels and signings and
stuff. Hopefully see you there. Also, I'll be at

131
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:39,457
Lexington Comic and Toy Con in Lexington,
Kentucky, March 9-11, Otafest in Calgary, May

132
00:09:39,457 --> 00:09:43,062
18-20, and A-Kon in Texas, June 7-10.

133
00:09:43,062 --> 00:09:45,699
ASHLEY: Jeez Louise, Matt.

134
00:09:45,699 --> 00:09:49,101
LAURA: We have Emerald City Comic Con, me and
Travis.

135
00:09:49,101 --> 00:09:51,204
TRAVIS: First weekend of March.

136
00:09:51,204 --> 00:09:58,843
MATT: Badass. Cool. All right, so. Paring it down,
finishing it up here. Thank you for your patience.

137
00:09:58,843 --> 00:10:05,916
With the new campaign, I want to renew our
appreciation for and make sure that we push to you

138
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:10,160
guys that we, from the very beginning, have been
supporting a really amazing charity called 826,

139
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,940
826LA being our local chapter. They have 826
groups all over the United States that they do

140
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:22,996
after-school creative writing, and a lot of great
creative classes for children who are either

141
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:27,461
underprivileged or don't have opportunities to go
to these types of classes. They do wonderful,

142
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:31,111
wonderful work, and we've been supporting them
from the very beginning, and we're just doubling

143
00:10:31,111 --> 00:10:35,140
down on that for this new campaign. You guys as a
community have been fantastic in supporting them,

144
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,230
and all the charities that we've supported from
the very beginning. Critmas every year has been a

145
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:44,338
very prime example of that, so I just wanted to
continue to push that forward, share the love, and

146
00:10:44,338 --> 00:10:49,938
a big thank-you to 826 for being such an amazing
source of creative drive for so many young kids

147
00:10:49,938 --> 00:10:53,359
who normally wouldn't have that opportunity. So
you guys are amazing, and show them your

148
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:54,880
appreciation if you can.

149
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,956
(cheering)

150
00:10:56,956 --> 00:11:02,650
MATT: Final shout-outs. One, thank you to Ian
Phillips of Iron Tusk Painting, who has painted

151
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,357
the miniatures for this campaign.

152
00:11:04,357 --> 00:11:06,670
(cheering)

153
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:10,417
MATT: He actually painted me and Marisha's cake
toppers for our wedding, and whenever you manage

154
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:14,671
to see them in the campaign, you can know that
it's his handiwork. Soon enough.

155
00:11:14,671 --> 00:11:23,520
ASHLEY: Also, fun fact about Ian Phillips: I grew
up with him. He was one of my brother's best

156
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,653
friends when we first moved out here to LA, and so
when that name was floating around, I was like,

157
00:11:28,653 --> 00:11:32,583
wait a minute. And then we reconnected back on
Instagram. It's such a crazy story. You know,

158
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,449
Critical Role brings it all back around.

159
00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:36,842
(laughter)

160
00:11:36,842 --> 00:11:40,301
MATT: I love it. So you can follow him,
@PaintingTusk on Twitter.

161
00:11:40,301 --> 00:11:44,079
LIAM: I've had him paint 20 to 30-- I'm kind of
addicted-- 20 to 30 miniatures. They're amazing.

162
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,646
He's amazing at what he does.

163
00:11:45,646 --> 00:11:49,665
MATT: And final thank-yous to Warner Bros and
Monolith Entertainment for letting us incorporate

164
00:11:49,665 --> 00:11:54,763
the Shadow of War soundtrack into our Critical
Role soundtrack here on the air, so those will be

165
00:11:54,763 --> 00:11:59,766
coming into the new campaign. And, super excited,
CD Projekt Red has been nice enough to allow us

166
00:11:59,766 --> 00:12:07,068
use of the Witcher series soundtrack to also
incorporate into the campaign, which, honestly,

167
00:12:07,068 --> 00:12:11,195
when we started playing at home, the Witcher
soundtrack was most of my music, and I couldn't

168
00:12:11,195 --> 00:12:15,273
use it when we started streaming, and so it's been
a cool full-circle to be able to bring it back in.

169
00:12:15,273 --> 00:12:20,198
Plus it brings a unique flavor that works with the
new campaign setting, so.

170
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:25,064
With that, I believe our announcements are done.
Thank you for bearing with us.

171
00:12:25,064 --> 00:12:27,400
LAURA: Wait, we're going to give-- oh, that's--

172
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,630
MARISHA: Afterwards.

173
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,008
SAM: There's one more announcement.

174
00:12:31,008 --> 00:12:39,041
MARISHA: Our announcement is our brand-new opening
title sequence. Which I think we're ready for.

175
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:45,872
MATT: So, as we bring it down, guys, let's go
ahead and prepare to dive in to the new year and

176
00:12:45,872 --> 00:12:49,302
the new campaign for this episode of Critical
Role.

177
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:51,912
(yelling)

178
00:12:51,912 --> 00:14:13,804
[80s music]

179
00:14:13,804 --> 00:14:17,233
(laughter)

180
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:19,443
MATT: And welcome back.

181
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:21,612
TRAVIS: That was a new level.

182
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:26,265
MATT: We've definitely returned to the table.
Thank you, Sam. So.

183
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:30,973
MARISHA: Wait, super fast. We've got to go through
credits. Right? Okay. So normally we don't do

184
00:14:30,973 --> 00:14:36,458
this, and I did this once before when we released
our other opening title sequence. Yeah, 50th. So

185
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:41,683
we're going to do this again. These are just
people who do so much and who do not get enough

186
00:14:41,683 --> 00:14:45,933
love. I'm going to shout them out. Sean Becker,
who's the unsung hero of Geek and Sundry, he's the

187
00:14:45,933 --> 00:14:51,900
executive producer. T.J. Rotell, he's our
production manager around here, he makes sure that

188
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:59,402
we actually have cameras. Maxwell James, our
producer that makes this show go every week. Dani

189
00:14:59,402 --> 00:15:06,598
Carr, our production coordinator, also huge
producer here. Steve Sprinkles, who directed that

190
00:15:06,598 --> 00:15:09,004
amazing opening title sequence.

191
00:15:09,004 --> 00:15:10,604
SAM: That's not a real name!

192
00:15:10,604 --> 00:15:14,815
MARISHA: I know. I love it on the slate. It always
says 'Sprinkles'. Jan-Michael Losada, who is our

193
00:15:14,815 --> 00:15:22,413
D.P., and is the same D.P. from last time. Tristan
Savage-Tate, our first A.C. Sean Delahunt, who is

194
00:15:22,413 --> 00:15:30,418
our key grip. Tyler Hart, who is our gaffer, who
gaffs everything around here, he's amazing. Jenny

195
00:15:30,418 --> 00:15:37,394
Newman, who did the amazing wardrobe. She sourced
all the wardrobe. Wren Witting, who's one of our

196
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:46,062
hair and makeup artists. Vanessa Marie, who is our
second hair and makeup artist. Jose Sosa, who was

197
00:15:46,062 --> 00:15:49,518
our production assistant. Selina Ruthe--

198
00:15:49,518 --> 00:15:50,961
LAURA: That's a lot of pieces of paper!

199
00:15:50,961 --> 00:15:54,716
MARISHA: I know. Selina Ruthe, who did additional
photography, and she also does stuff every day.

200
00:15:54,716 --> 00:15:56,439
LAURA: Why didn't you put them on the same piece
of paper?

201
00:15:56,439 --> 00:15:59,153
MARISHA: Because I didn't know there was going to
be this many. Brandon Clark, who was our location

202
00:15:59,153 --> 00:16:05,269
manager. Pamela Joy, who shot all the photos for
that, and Loretta Ritchert.

203
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:08,353
LAURA: Yeah, they're with Heirloom Photography,
and they did all of our thumbnails, too. They did

204
00:16:08,353 --> 00:16:09,603
that poster.

205
00:16:09,603 --> 00:16:11,096
ASHLEY: Go check them out on Instagram!

206
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:14,010
MARISHA: Jason Charles Miller, who does our
music.

207
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,749
LIAM: Party on, Garthok!

208
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:20,126
MARISHA: Sean Hudson, who does our
post-production. And Andy Inglat, who edited that

209
00:16:20,126 --> 00:16:24,464
thing. Okay. I'm sweating a lot.

210
00:16:24,464 --> 00:16:26,193
MATT: That's okay. So.

211
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,205
SAM: What a night. Well, guys...

212
00:16:28,205 --> 00:16:30,509
TALIESIN: This has been great.

213
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:32,102
LIAM: Holy shit.

214
00:16:32,102 --> 00:16:34,588
MATT: Everyone. <i>Everyone.</i>

215
00:16:34,588 --> 00:16:36,530
SAM: Can we open our fricking books yet?

216
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,161
MARISHA: Not yet.

217
00:16:38,161 --> 00:16:50,006
MATT: Welcome to Wildemount. The year is 835 P.D.,
or post-Divergence. This continent is divided both

218
00:16:50,006 --> 00:16:56,378
by jagged terrain and political powers. The
Menagerie Coast, a collection of city-states

219
00:16:56,378 --> 00:17:02,634
united under the Clovis Concord, monopolizes the
southwestern shores and ports of Wildemount,

220
00:17:02,634 --> 00:17:08,826
thriving on open trade and cultural freedom.
Beyond the Cyrios Mountains lies the massive

221
00:17:08,826 --> 00:17:16,580
region known as Wynandir, bisected by the
Ashkeeper Peaks. Eastern Wynandir houses the

222
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:22,249
expansive wastes and turbulent badlands of
Xhorhas, overrun with all manner of beasts and

223
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:27,981
terrors, relics from the final battles of the
Calamity that ruined that scarred landscape.

224
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:33,833
Northward, you would find the Greying Wildlands, a
lawless realm harboring a curse that has kept it

225
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:42,490
unconquered by human hands. However, this story
begins in the territory of Western Wynandir,

226
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:50,810
within the boundaries of the Dwendalian Empire.
Emerging 13 generations before, the Dwendalian

227
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:55,806
Empire has slowly spread to encompass the
surrounding societies of the region, absorbing the

228
00:17:55,806 --> 00:18:01,950
peoples of the Zemni Fields and the Marrow Valley,
before finally conquering the Julous Dominion and

229
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:05,682
taking the whole of Western Wynandir for the
Empire.

230
00:18:05,682 --> 00:18:08,104
SAM: There will be no test.

231
00:18:08,104 --> 00:18:16,764
MATT: No. This is-- let me continue. Under the
rule of the current King Bertrand Dwendal, now in

232
00:18:16,764 --> 00:18:23,669
his 68th year, most are left to their own devices.
You live as you did before. The crown only takes a

233
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:31,544
tithe of what you produce and earn. You follow its
laws, worship its gods, and bow to its installed

234
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:38,925
local leadership. In return, denizens of the
Empire are protected from the chaotic horrors and

235
00:18:38,925 --> 00:18:45,085
shadowed evils that stalk the edges of the
civilized lands. This accord has led to a

236
00:18:45,085 --> 00:18:51,369
prosperous century for the Empire, or at least the
political elite. Tensions brew beneath the

237
00:18:51,369 --> 00:18:57,218
chafing watch of the Crown's Guard. Every temple
is government-owned and run, and worship outside

238
00:18:57,218 --> 00:19:03,500
the approved idolatry is met with imprisonment.
Rumors of military clashes at the eastern border

239
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:12,820
near Xhorhas have many common folk on edge. Our
story, however, begins much smaller. Here in the

240
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:17,847
southern reaches of the Marrow Valley, beyond the
entry gates of the Wuyun Gorge, lies the small

241
00:19:17,847 --> 00:19:24,087
rural town of Trostenwald. Bordering the blue
waters of the Ustaloch, this town came to

242
00:19:24,087 --> 00:19:28,328
prominence near the turn of this recent century,
when the surrounding fertile farmlands were

243
00:19:28,328 --> 00:19:33,934
discovered to produce a unique type of grain and
wheat, leading to a boom of breweries. When the

244
00:19:33,934 --> 00:19:37,465
glut subsided, three large families stood
triumphant in the local business of fermented

245
00:19:37,465 --> 00:19:46,859
delights. Now Trostenwald thrives on their exports
of fish, crops, and ale. Here in this sleepy trade

246
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:53,981
stop along the Amber Road, a handful of wandering
destinies slowly begin to intersect.

247
00:19:53,981 --> 00:20:01,657
We begin in the early hours of the morning on the
day of Grissen in a messy room on the second floor

248
00:20:01,657 --> 00:20:09,837
of the Nestled Nook Inn. A bleary-eyed, bruised
man in a tattered coat slowly wakens from his

249
00:20:09,837 --> 00:20:15,740
lengthy sleep, catching his small, snoring ally
curled at the foot of the bed. Liam, if you would

250
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,780
like to describe your character, please.

251
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,597
(nervous laughter)

252
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:22,957
LAURA: Oh my god, no pressure!

253
00:20:22,957 --> 00:20:24,941
SAM: Were we supposed to prepare this?

254
00:20:24,941 --> 00:20:37,970
LIAM: I'm pretty filthy. I have a mess of
reddish-brown hair, and really filthy road

255
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:49,408
clothes. I wear a long coat that I slept in. I
slept about 20 hours last night. Jeez. Unshaven, a

256
00:20:49,408 --> 00:20:51,051
bit of a mess.

257
00:20:51,051 --> 00:20:53,617
SAM: So far you're just talking about current
Liam.

258
00:20:53,617 --> 00:20:56,253
LAURA: What color are your eyes? I need visual.

259
00:20:56,253 --> 00:21:06,707
LIAM: They're blue. That's it. It was a rough day
yesterday, and-- that's it.

260
00:21:06,707 --> 00:21:08,131
MATT: And your name is?

261
00:21:08,131 --> 00:21:10,385
LIAM: Oh. Caleb. Caleb Widogast.

262
00:21:10,385 --> 00:21:15,536
MATT: All right. As your smaller friend curls
awake, Sam, would you like to describe your

263
00:21:15,536 --> 00:21:17,015
character?

264
00:21:17,015 --> 00:21:23,385
SAM: Yeah. Um. I am a little goblin girl.

265
00:21:23,385 --> 00:21:26,426
(laughter)

266
00:21:26,426 --> 00:21:42,072
SAM: I am a goblin. So, you know, the green skin,
the green hair, the yellow eyes. And she wears

267
00:21:42,072 --> 00:21:48,137
not-great clothes, just like her traveling
companion there. She hides in the shadows a lot,

268
00:21:48,137 --> 00:21:55,653
because she knows goblins aren't welcome in this
part, and that's about it. I mean, she's a little

269
00:21:55,653 --> 00:22:00,814
skittish, and right now she's probably stirring
awake as well, right?

270
00:22:00,814 --> 00:22:02,854
MATT: Well. What's your name?

271
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:04,811
SAM: Oh. Nott the Brave.

272
00:22:04,811 --> 00:22:11,388
MATT: So Caleb, as you come to consciousness, you
glance over and can see, slowly snoring and

273
00:22:11,388 --> 00:22:20,114
rousing at about the same time, Nott's eyes blink
open, her slowly groaning face looking over

274
00:22:20,114 --> 00:22:21,919
towards you.

275
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:34,902
SAM: (high-pitched Cockney accent) Oh! You're finally awake, 
I see. Oh yeah, motherfuckers. It's on. You were out for quite

276
00:22:34,902 --> 00:22:38,151
some time, there. Rough day, eh?

277
00:22:38,151 --> 00:22:40,157
LIAM: (light German accent) Not our best day, no.

278
00:22:40,157 --> 00:22:46,749
SAM: No, I mean, usually you're so good at
everything, but yesterday you were just-- maybe

279
00:22:46,749 --> 00:22:48,869
you needed the sleep, is what you needed.

280
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:51,393
LIAM: Thank you.

281
00:22:51,393 --> 00:23:04,846
SAM: Well, don't thank me yet. I should probably
tell you what happened while you were asleep. I

282
00:23:04,846 --> 00:23:11,307
mean, you were asleep for so long. I got bored,
frankly. I was going through my pack and

283
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,808
reorganizing.

284
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,641
LIAM: Has anybody seen you-- <i>seen you</i> seen you?

285
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:24,481
SAM: Well, I mean, many people? I got bored.
You've never slept that long, so I left, I went

286
00:23:24,481 --> 00:23:30,215
downstairs, I thought I'd do a bit of
window-shopping, and you know how sometimes I get

287
00:23:30,215 --> 00:23:31,698
the itch, you know?

288
00:23:31,698 --> 00:23:36,772
LIAM: I do. Did you make it back here okay, at
night?

289
00:23:36,772 --> 00:23:37,826
SAM: I'm here, aren't I?

290
00:23:37,826 --> 00:23:38,854
LIAM: Yeah, you are.

291
00:23:38,854 --> 00:23:46,109
SAM: Yeah, I did. But I might have been spotted by
a few of the Crown's Guard.

292
00:23:46,109 --> 00:23:47,895
LIAM: Did you have the mask on?

293
00:23:47,895 --> 00:23:58,355
SAM: No? No, I didn't. But they didn't catch me,
so. Listen, I'm sorry, sometimes I get the urge,

294
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:04,145
I've got to take something, you know? I was trying
to replentish what you lost yesterday, and I failed.

295
00:24:04,145 --> 00:24:10,898
LIAM: Well, we-- (sighs)-- discussed coming to a
bigger town. It's going to be a little more

296
00:24:10,898 --> 00:24:17,144
difficult now. You can't go-- it was easier on
outskirts, it was easier in farms, but we can't do

297
00:24:17,144 --> 00:24:18,982
that here.

298
00:24:18,982 --> 00:24:25,184
SAM: I know, I'm sorry. Yeah. I know. You're
right. Yep. I just got a little bit squiggly.

299
00:24:25,184 --> 00:24:26,602
That's all.

300
00:24:26,602 --> 00:24:31,301
LIAM: Okay. Well, I think today you should have
the mask on at all times.

301
00:24:31,301 --> 00:24:33,193
SAM: Yeah, good idea, Caleb.

302
00:24:33,193 --> 00:24:42,667
LIAM: It's better when we're working together. If
you need to steal something, do it with my help,

303
00:24:42,667 --> 00:24:44,055
all right?

304
00:24:44,055 --> 00:24:45,863
SAM: Yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah.

305
00:24:45,863 --> 00:24:55,971
LIAM: Back up the conversation a minute. Thank
you. I would not be alive if you had not-- you

306
00:24:55,971 --> 00:24:58,393
saved my life. So thank you.

307
00:24:58,393 --> 00:25:00,513
SAM: Ah, no problem.

308
00:25:00,513 --> 00:25:04,317
LIAM: Yesterday was really not great.

309
00:25:04,317 --> 00:25:07,628
SAM: Yeah, well, we'll do better today, right?

310
00:25:07,628 --> 00:25:13,155
LIAM: Sure. Sure we will. Are you hungry?

311
00:25:13,155 --> 00:25:15,133
SAM: Yeah, I'm starving.

312
00:25:15,133 --> 00:25:19,047
MATT: At this point, you notice the gentle smell
of cooked meats and promises of mediocre porridge

313
00:25:19,047 --> 00:25:25,268
and eggs just barely begins to creep beneath the
subtle floor of your room, meet your nostrils.

314
00:25:25,268 --> 00:25:32,038
LIAM: Well, Nott, what are we going to do today? I
can go down and get breakfast and bring it up

315
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:38,606
here. At least-- I don't know. I mean, I'm a
little wary of just splashing back into the town

316
00:25:38,606 --> 00:25:40,102
right away.

317
00:25:40,102 --> 00:25:44,984
SAM: Let's go down, get some food. I'll come with
you, 'cause as you said, we're better together.

318
00:25:44,984 --> 00:25:50,169
And we'll take it from there. You need some books
and stuff, right?

319
00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:52,510
LIAM: Always.

320
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:55,756
SAM: All right, well, that's on the to-do list.

321
00:25:55,756 --> 00:25:58,924
LIAM: All right, well, let's get something to eat,
then.

322
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:04,984
MATT: All right, so you prepare yourself with your
mask set over?

323
00:26:04,984 --> 00:26:13,272
SAM: Yes, yeah, so I have a half a mask that
covers my goblin face, and with the hood over,

324
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:18,148
kind of obscures. Maybe it's not a goblin, maybe
it's a little halfling person or something.

325
00:26:18,148 --> 00:26:24,280
MATT: Which is helpful. The southern, more rural
region of the Empire, especially near Felderwin,

326
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:29,749
which is one of the largest tilling and farming
areas of the entire Empire, has a very heavy

327
00:26:29,749 --> 00:26:37,830
halfling population. And so while this city is not
the core of it, you'd probably see a larger 20-25%

328
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:42,568
of the population here in Trostenwald is halfling.
So you pass off pretty decently as long as you

329
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:49,106
keep away from discerning, intent eyes. So the two
of you manage to gather your things for the time

330
00:26:49,106 --> 00:26:58,148
being, wander down the stairs from the top floor
down to the base of the tavern, which, the air is

331
00:26:58,148 --> 00:27:02,110
already bustling with townsfolk and all manner of
travelers preparing to take on the day's

332
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:07,116
responsibilities. Yorda, the 40-something woman
barkeep with shoulder-length blonde hair and

333
00:27:07,116 --> 00:27:11,722
weathered skin that you previously rented your
room at the inn from, frantically darts behind the

334
00:27:11,722 --> 00:27:17,575
bar while the red-headed barmaid rushes from table
to table. It seems that the clientele is a bit

335
00:27:17,575 --> 00:27:21,700
more than they were expecting this morning. Yorda
yells from behind the bar to the barkeep,

336
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:27,247
"Adelaine, two more brats and a bit of mush at the
corner table." She looks up, "I'm working on it!"

337
00:27:27,247 --> 00:27:30,905
And she runs over and heads back to the kitchen.
There's a faint bit of music as two

338
00:27:30,905 --> 00:27:36,354
slovenly-looking musicians in the corner are
trying to work for tips with a small hat on the

339
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:40,376
floor that it looks like nobody's thrown any coin
into it. The tables are fairly busy, except for

340
00:27:40,376 --> 00:27:44,296
maybe two that appear to be available between the
two of you guys, if you'd like to find a seat.

341
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:49,082
LIAM: Okay. Sure. Is that easy to do, find a
seat?

342
00:27:49,082 --> 00:27:51,140
MATT: Yeah, you walk over to it, you sit down.

343
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,560
(laughter)

344
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,790
LIAM: Is this how D&D works?

345
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,171
SAM: What do we roll for?

346
00:27:57,171 --> 00:27:59,660
(laughter)

347
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:04,424
MATT: You sit down, and due to the chaos that
ensues around you, it takes a little while for

348
00:28:04,424 --> 00:28:09,981
Adelaine, the red-headed barmaid, to come by, and
she scoots by the table. "I'm terribly sorry. What

349
00:28:09,981 --> 00:28:11,530
"can I get you?"

350
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:17,791
SAM: You know, meat if you have it, but if you
don't, that's okay, too. Potatoes, or bacon if

351
00:28:17,791 --> 00:28:19,731
it's on the menu, but really anything--

352
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:21,760
MATT: "I can get you all three, it's fine. What
you want?"

353
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,068
LIAM: A Trost for each of us, please.

354
00:28:24,224 --> 00:28:29,956
MATT: "For breakfast? I like you. All right, two
Trosts and a bunch of meats. Be right back." And

355
00:28:29,956 --> 00:28:34,528
she rushes off, she pulls her hair back and ties it as
she goes into the kitchen, getting ready for the

356
00:28:34,528 --> 00:28:40,154
midst of chaos. While you guys have a moment there
at the table, you can hear conversation muttering

357
00:28:40,154 --> 00:28:43,707
around you, and you have a brief bit of privacy to
discuss.

358
00:28:43,707 --> 00:28:48,817
LIAM: Yes, I need books, that's true, but did you
find drink yesterday?

359
00:28:48,817 --> 00:28:51,377
SAM: I have a little left in my flask.

360
00:28:51,377 --> 00:28:52,499
LIAM: How much?

361
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:54,628
SAM: Just a couple swigs.

362
00:28:54,628 --> 00:28:58,046
LIAM: So that's also on the to-do list, then.

363
00:28:58,046 --> 00:29:01,302
SAM: I mean, if you don't want me to get too
jittery, yeah.

364
00:29:01,302 --> 00:29:04,353
LIAM: All right. Okay. So we'll do that first.

365
00:29:04,353 --> 00:29:06,013
SAM: All right.

366
00:29:06,013 --> 00:29:07,938
TRAVIS: I love her.

367
00:29:07,938 --> 00:29:10,182
(laughter)

368
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:14,642
MATT: A short time passes before the two platters
are rushed over and scattered across the front of

369
00:29:14,642 --> 00:29:19,831
your table with a clattering. Pile of meats there
set for you, a little bit placed on the side,

370
00:29:19,831 --> 00:29:24,946
because you might need, especially with the look
on your face-- Adelaine gives you a glance and

371
00:29:24,946 --> 00:29:30,067
goes, "Put something in your belly." Comes back
and slides two Trosts to you.

372
00:29:30,067 --> 00:29:35,092
SAM: I remove my little mask, and then just go
(eating noises).

373
00:29:35,092 --> 00:29:38,968
(laughter)

374
00:29:38,968 --> 00:29:43,870
LIAM: I take the last piece.

375
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:53,527
MATT: As you guys are partway through your meal--
let's see, this would be Caleb. You notice out of

376
00:29:53,527 --> 00:30:00,311
the corner of your eye a gentleman enter the door
looking kind of meek. Middle-age, looks

377
00:30:00,311 --> 00:30:07,902
work-hardened. He has a heavy chin-beard that is
unkempt and a bit wild, but his eyes are warm.

378
00:30:07,902 --> 00:30:16,883
He's holding his hat in his grip, and he scans the
room with an eager glance before his face

379
00:30:16,883 --> 00:30:24,168
brightens, and he begins to push his way across
the room, in your direction, it looks like. He

380
00:30:24,168 --> 00:30:29,785
scoots over towards your table, and as you're
about to turn and see what he's about--

381
00:30:29,785 --> 00:30:31,974
LIAM: I'm putting my hand on my purse.

382
00:30:31,974 --> 00:30:37,226
MATT: --he pivots to the table next to you
instead. He turns to you three.

383
00:30:37,226 --> 00:30:40,145
(yelps)

384
00:30:40,145 --> 00:30:43,012
LAURA: We've just been sitting here this whole
time!

385
00:30:43,012 --> 00:30:55,785
MATT: Yeah. You've met this man the day before,
Rinaldo, the fisherman, who you had aided. And as

386
00:30:55,785 --> 00:30:58,456
he approaches, he goes, "Might I sit, please?"

387
00:30:58,456 --> 00:30:59,914
LAURA: Of course, take a seat.

388
00:30:59,914 --> 00:31:01,331
SAM: What's that?

389
00:31:01,331 --> 00:31:04,000
MATT: As he sits down in his chair, I would ask
each of you to please describe yourselves,

390
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,532
starting with you, Laura.

391
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:11,904
LAURA: (Slavic accent) Oh, well, okay. I'm just, you 
know, a little blue tiefling, that's all, with blue hair.

392
00:31:11,904 --> 00:31:20,778
And I'm wearing a pretty cute dress, that's all.
And I'm having a good time, you know? We're just

393
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:22,891
having a good time here at breakfast.

394
00:31:22,891 --> 00:31:26,102
MATT: All right. And you?

395
00:31:26,102 --> 00:31:35,309
MARISHA: Uh, yeah. Yeah. I'm, you know,
simple girl, simple needs. Just wearing nice, baggy

396
00:31:35,368 --> 00:31:42,468
clothes, some monk vestiges. They're in nice blues
and greys. You notice I have a blue sash around my

397
00:31:42,507 --> 00:31:49,587
belt. Got a nice shave going on, little undercut.
Looks like maybe I put on makeup two days ago, and

398
00:31:49,587 --> 00:31:56,522
I'm like, yeah, it's still holding up. It's fine.
I can work with that.

399
00:31:56,522 --> 00:31:57,835
SAM: What's your name?

400
00:31:57,835 --> 00:32:01,969
MATT: We'll get to that. Thank you. And Travis, if
you'd like to describe yourself, please?

401
00:32:01,969 --> 00:32:05,314
TRAVIS: (Texan drawl) Yeah, I'm here too.

402
00:32:05,314 --> 00:32:10,976
(laughter)

403
00:32:10,976 --> 00:32:19,116
TRAVIS: I'm a half-orc, sitting here in beat-up
leathers. Have a big scar across my face.

404
00:32:19,116 --> 00:32:20,696
SAM: (sings 'Bad to the Bone')

405
00:32:20,696 --> 00:32:26,708
(laughter)

406
00:32:26,708 --> 00:32:35,795
TRAVIS: Green skin tone, and got some piecemeal
armor put together and stuff. My name's Fjord.

407
00:32:35,795 --> 00:32:39,759
LAURA: You're very handsome. I just need to tell
you.

408
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:41,490
TRAVIS: Thank you. Appreciate that.

409
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:46,028
MATT: As Rinaldo sits down, clutching his hat
still in his hands, says, "I thank you for your

410
00:32:46,028 --> 00:32:49,899
"time. Fjord. And, I apologize, I forget your
names."

411
00:32:49,899 --> 00:32:51,564
MARISHA: Beauregard.

412
00:32:51,564 --> 00:32:53,251
MATT: "Beauregard. And?"

413
00:32:53,251 --> 00:32:54,254
LAURA: Jester.

414
00:32:54,254 --> 00:33:02,520
MATT: "Jester, thank you. You all came when no one
else would yesterday, and because of you my

415
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,525
"daughter is still alive."

416
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:11,276
MARISHA: Oh yeah. Sorry for being a pessimistic
asshole, by the way, when we first came into town.

417
00:33:11,276 --> 00:33:12,832
MATT: "Oh, that's okay."

418
00:33:12,832 --> 00:33:15,694
MARISHA: I'm not used to things turning out good.

419
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:25,381
MATT: "You'll do well this side of the Empire.
Anyway. I won't keep you, but I-- we spoke

420
00:33:25,381 --> 00:33:31,233
"yesterday, and I didn't have much to give you.
Sent you away with nothing but my gratitude. But

421
00:33:31,233 --> 00:33:37,680
"I've been asking around the other fishermen,
lochsmen, and we've put together a little bit of

422
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:41,569
"coin for your troubles, so." And he turns his cap
over on the table, and this catches your

423
00:33:41,569 --> 00:33:47,749
attention, you hear this clattering of coin. Your
eyes glance over, especially you, Nott, and watch

424
00:33:47,749 --> 00:33:51,785
as he leaves this pile of what looks to be mostly
copper and silver pieces, with a couple of

425
00:33:51,785 --> 00:33:56,489
glimmers of gold, and as soon as it clatters
across the hard wood table here in the center of

426
00:33:56,489 --> 00:34:01,796
the tavern, other faces begin to turn, gather
attention as to what's happening over here in the

427
00:34:01,796 --> 00:34:08,196
back edge, and he takes his cap back and pushes it
forward towards all of you, his dirty, you can see

428
00:34:08,196 --> 00:34:14,442
cracked and very callused fingers shoving it in
your direction, before taking his hat and placing

429
00:34:14,442 --> 00:34:16,257
it back over his head.

430
00:34:16,257 --> 00:34:17,406
LAURA: So cool!

431
00:34:17,406 --> 00:34:19,225
LIAM: Those coins went all over the floor?

432
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:26,677
MATT: All over the table. "I hope it's helpful.
But thank you."

433
00:34:26,677 --> 00:34:29,266
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. Oh wait.

434
00:34:29,266 --> 00:34:31,360
TRAVIS: We can't accept this, right? I mean, it's
too much.

435
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:35,836
MARISHA: We're supposed to at least say that,
right? And then still accept it, right?

436
00:34:35,836 --> 00:34:37,757
TRAVIS: I think you're supposed to do it if you
say it.

437
00:34:37,757 --> 00:34:42,467
LAURA: Well, I mean, he did go around to a bunch
of people. That was a lot of work on his part. I

438
00:34:42,467 --> 00:34:46,280
would hate to make him go back to all of those
people and give it back to each individual

439
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,137
person.

440
00:34:47,137 --> 00:34:48,177
TRAVIS: Fine, fine.

441
00:34:48,177 --> 00:34:51,625
MARISHA: If he didn't keep a ledger, you know. We
wouldn't want to do that. It's rude not to accept

442
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:54,033
a gift, right? It's rude not to accept a gift,
right?

443
00:34:54,033 --> 00:35:02,394
MATT: "I would hope that is the case. Anyway.
Thank you very much. I am sorry for getting in

444
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:07,261
"your way." And he stands up and gives you all a
nod and rushes out of the tavern, a little

445
00:35:07,261 --> 00:35:10,093
embarrassed by all the attention that's now placed
on him by the other patrons, and as he leaves,

446
00:35:10,093 --> 00:35:14,449
everyone goes back to their business, a couple of
wandering eyes starting to count what coins are

447
00:35:14,449 --> 00:35:17,055
there as you slowly mitt them in your direction.

448
00:35:17,055 --> 00:35:18,873
LAURA: Divide it up.

449
00:35:18,873 --> 00:35:20,186
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

450
00:35:20,186 --> 00:35:28,898
MATT: There are four gold pieces amongst the pile,
22 silver, and 48 copper pieces.

451
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,944
TRAVIS: Can I clock the room, see who else is
watching her count?

452
00:35:32,944 --> 00:35:35,195
MATT: Perception check. 48 copper.

453
00:35:35,195 --> 00:35:36,612
TRAVIS: Is this the first roll?

454
00:35:36,612 --> 00:35:40,370
MATT: First roll of the campaign.

455
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:42,279
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

456
00:35:42,279 --> 00:35:46,403
(cheering)

457
00:35:46,403 --> 00:35:52,034
MATT: And that's how you start it. All right.

458
00:35:52,034 --> 00:35:57,441
LAURA: So I'm leaving it to you to do that
counting. Which is really hard for me, personally,

459
00:35:57,441 --> 00:35:59,146
but there you go.

460
00:35:59,146 --> 00:36:03,096
MARISHA: How do you split up four gold? We have
four gold and there's only three of us.

461
00:36:03,096 --> 00:36:04,668
LAURA: Don't know.

462
00:36:04,668 --> 00:36:07,401
TRAVIS: Well, I actually did pretty good at that
card game, so you can have mine.

463
00:36:07,401 --> 00:36:11,003
MARISHA: Aw. I will. Okay.

464
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:13,252
LAURA: So two for each of us! That's great.

465
00:36:13,252 --> 00:36:18,266
MARISHA: Oh, that's good. One for you, two for
me, two for-- oh wait, no, wait, math doesn't

466
00:36:18,266 --> 00:36:20,060
make sense.

467
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,692
SAM: She's your treasurer?

468
00:36:21,692 --> 00:36:23,751
MATT: This is going to go great.

469
00:36:23,751 --> 00:36:27,447
LAURA: It's hard not being the treasurer.

470
00:36:27,447 --> 00:36:37,134
MARISHA: I'll give two to Jester, one for you, one
for me. And then 22 silver, that's--

471
00:36:37,134 --> 00:36:40,488
LAURA: Tell you what, you do that math.

472
00:36:40,488 --> 00:36:47,430
MATT: While you're counting this out and figuring
out the division of your gains, Fjord, you glance

473
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:55,767
about, narrowing your orcish eyes across the room,
and you can see two other tables there are some

474
00:36:55,767 --> 00:37:00,150
gentlemen who are peering over, and as soon as
they meet your gaze, they go right back to their

475
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:08,950
business and completely shrink away. There's a man
and a hooded figure at a table immediately

476
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:14,934
adjacent to you. The man looks rather filthy, his
hair a bit unkempt, and he's trying to finish his

477
00:37:14,934 --> 00:37:20,692
drink. However, the smaller halfling-looking
figure is just glaring intently, and is slowly

478
00:37:20,692 --> 00:37:22,990
leaning in the direction of the table.

479
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:29,244
TRAVIS: That's creepy. Fucking disgusting. I think
we have people watching us.

480
00:37:29,244 --> 00:37:31,182
LAURA: Who is watching us?

481
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:33,724
TRAVIS: Well, just take a look right over there.

482
00:37:33,724 --> 00:37:38,446
SAM: Don't arouse suspicion, but did you hear all
that coin hit that table, Caleb?

483
00:37:38,446 --> 00:37:42,992
LIAM: I did. It's on the table, though, so I think
on the table it will stay.

484
00:37:42,992 --> 00:37:49,655
SAM: Yes, but we could follow them out. We could
do the Moneypot. We could run Rat Food. We could

485
00:37:49,655 --> 00:37:55,501
do Prince and the Pauper to get it from them. We
could try Spider Eyes. Any of those could work--

486
00:37:55,501 --> 00:37:57,942
LAURA: Are you guys staying here?

487
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:02,480
MATT: This blue-skinned tiefling suddenly leans
over to you at the table.

488
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:08,328
SAM: Don't move. Don't move. Tieflings can only
see movement.

489
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:11,791
LIAM: I don't think that's true--

490
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:15,747
LAURA: It's very true, we have a hard time seeing
things that aren't moving, it's very true. But I

491
00:38:15,747 --> 00:38:21,401
can hear you. You should take a bath. You know they
have showers here. It's possible.

492
00:38:21,401 --> 00:38:22,953
LIAM: A what now?

493
00:38:22,953 --> 00:38:24,932
LAURA: You bathe yourself in water.

494
00:38:24,932 --> 00:38:28,252
LIAM: No, I've bathed before, yeah, I know what a
bath is.

495
00:38:28,252 --> 00:38:32,857
LAURA: It's because you smell really bad, and it's
wafting over this direction. I'm just letting you

496
00:38:32,857 --> 00:38:36,343
know. I would hate if I smelled that bad and
someone didn't tell me.

497
00:38:36,343 --> 00:38:38,880
LIAM: I've only just met you.

498
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,161
LAURA: Hi! I'm Jester.

499
00:38:41,161 --> 00:38:44,892
LIAM: Hi, I'm Caleb.

500
00:38:44,892 --> 00:38:50,855
LAURA: Nice to meet you, Caleb. How much silver
did I just get?

501
00:38:50,855 --> 00:38:51,943
MARISHA: Seven!

502
00:38:51,943 --> 00:38:52,898
LAURA: Woo!

503
00:38:52,898 --> 00:38:56,144
(laughter)

504
00:38:56,144 --> 00:38:59,822
MARISHA: And 16 copper. Aren't you all jealous?

505
00:38:59,822 --> 00:39:04,315
SAM: Morning.

506
00:39:04,315 --> 00:39:06,016
MARISHA: Morning.

507
00:39:06,016 --> 00:39:11,506
MATT: Make a perception check, Beauregard and
Jester.

508
00:39:11,506 --> 00:39:14,985
LAURA: Whoa.

509
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:18,857
LIAM: Are you checking your DnD Beyond specs?

510
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,564
MARISHA: I am, I'm adding my--

511
00:39:20,564 --> 00:39:29,708
LAURA: 22. I haven't even flipped over my
character sheet yet. This is crazy.

512
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:31,363
MARISHA: 19.

513
00:39:31,363 --> 00:39:39,071
MATT: Okay. The somewhat meek female halfling
who's now suddenly very reserved, and not as

514
00:39:39,071 --> 00:39:46,733
filthy as the human compatriot that she keeps,
seems less and less halfling the more you glance

515
00:39:46,733 --> 00:39:53,423
in her direction. The ears are folded inward but
elongated, the tinges of green to the skin, and

516
00:39:53,423 --> 00:39:58,106
with the little words that have poked through her
lips, you can see what appear to be teeth more jagged

517
00:39:58,106 --> 00:40:01,271
than expected of the half-folk.

518
00:40:01,271 --> 00:40:06,073
MARISHA: I just shout over and I say, good
morning, in Halfling.

519
00:40:06,073 --> 00:40:16,345
SAM: I know Halfling, right? Yes. I'll shout back,
top of the morning to you.

520
00:40:16,345 --> 00:40:21,880
(laughter)

521
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,104
MARISHA: Would you like a coffee? I'd love to buy
you a coffee.

522
00:40:25,104 --> 00:40:33,291
SAM: We've got-- free coffee? Yeah, yeah, I'll
take it. Sure. Thank you.

523
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:37,639
TRAVIS: You're being mighty fucking friendly. They
were looking at our coin.

524
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:42,498
MARISHA: Why can't they have been looking at me?
Maybe they were looking at me.

525
00:40:42,498 --> 00:40:44,160
TRAVIS: I didn't think of that.

526
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:49,517
MARISHA: Maybe they were looking at you. As Jester
said, you're handsome.

527
00:40:49,517 --> 00:40:51,475
LIAM: Just--

528
00:40:51,475 --> 00:40:52,901
LAURA: Yes?

529
00:40:52,901 --> 00:40:55,044
LIAM: Nott.

530
00:40:55,044 --> 00:40:57,492
SAM: He said "Jest".

531
00:40:57,492 --> 00:40:59,689
LAURA: I just thought you said my name, is all.

532
00:40:59,689 --> 00:41:03,956
MARISHA: Oh, I said your name. Oh, they might have
said your name, too.

533
00:41:03,956 --> 00:41:07,999
LIAM: Never mind, never mind. Could I get another
Trost over here, please?

534
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:09,752
SAM: Two, please, right away.

535
00:41:09,752 --> 00:41:17,761
MATT: Eventually Adelaine comes by and brings two
fresh Trosts to the table, glancing about at the

536
00:41:17,761 --> 00:41:24,702
unique tension in the air right here. "Would you
like anything as well?"

537
00:41:24,702 --> 00:41:28,759
LAURA: Oh, yes. Lots of baked goods if you have
them, please.

538
00:41:28,759 --> 00:41:30,602
TRAVIS: Pork belly, if you have it.

539
00:41:30,602 --> 00:41:33,168
MARISHA: I don't think I've seen you eat anything
other than pastries.

540
00:41:33,168 --> 00:41:34,891
LAURA: I really like them.

541
00:41:34,891 --> 00:41:40,162
MARISHA: I'm kind of concerned for your
well-being. It's fine, I'm not that concerned.

542
00:41:40,162 --> 00:41:44,490
Eat whatever you want. I'll have bacon, some
ham, whatever.

543
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:50,778
MATT: "All right, pork it is. I'll be right back."
She rushes off to the kitchen. You guys continue

544
00:41:50,778 --> 00:41:52,515
to awkwardly stare at each other.

545
00:41:52,515 --> 00:42:00,083
LIAM: I'm going to put my hand up and say,
quietly, to Nott, the Moneypot is not for them.

546
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:04,440
It's not for them, it's for farmers. Okay?

547
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,405
SAM: Yeah, you're right, you're right.

548
00:42:06,405 --> 00:42:09,066
MARISHA: Do we notice them whispering?

549
00:42:09,066 --> 00:42:10,537
MATT: With your perception rolls earlier? Yes.

550
00:42:10,537 --> 00:42:13,544
LIAM: But I said it really quietly.

551
00:42:13,544 --> 00:42:16,073
(laughter)

552
00:42:16,073 --> 00:42:17,211
MATT: She rolled a 22.

553
00:42:17,211 --> 00:42:18,899
LIAM: But she can hear my little whisper?

554
00:42:18,899 --> 00:42:23,783
MATT: No, you heard the whisper, you're not sure
what the words are. You can see that they're

555
00:42:23,783 --> 00:42:26,423
whispering. Being mysterious.

556
00:42:26,423 --> 00:42:29,303
LAURA: Okay, cool.

557
00:42:29,303 --> 00:42:36,697
SAM: In Halfling, I'll say to Beau--

558
00:42:36,697 --> 00:42:39,306
MARISHA: Beau for short works.

559
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:48,498
SAM: Are you in town for business or pleasure?

560
00:42:48,889 --> 00:42:52,065
MARISHA: Can I insight check him, see what he's
hiding?

561
00:42:52,065 --> 00:42:53,447
MATT: Make an insight check.

562
00:42:53,447 --> 00:42:55,738
MARISHA: Okay. What's my insight, I can't
remember.

563
00:42:55,738 --> 00:43:00,573
LAURA: What is he saying? I mean you, you're a
girl. What is she saying? Shit. That's really hard

564
00:43:00,573 --> 00:43:01,965
to remember now.

565
00:43:01,965 --> 00:43:03,390
SAM: You're asking me what I'm saying.

566
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:04,604
LAURA: Yeah, what did you just say?

567
00:43:04,604 --> 00:43:05,721
MARISHA: 13.

568
00:43:05,721 --> 00:43:13,586
MATT: 13? I mean, seems to be genuine. Hard to
read through all the wrappings, shadow, and the

569
00:43:13,586 --> 00:43:15,442
hood still obscuring the face.

570
00:43:15,442 --> 00:43:18,457
LAURA: Do you have the mask covering you?

571
00:43:18,457 --> 00:43:20,345
SAM: I think I do.

572
00:43:20,345 --> 00:43:28,741
MATT: Yeah, it's this porcelain covering that has
painted lips. It's a little unsettling.

573
00:43:28,741 --> 00:43:35,765
LIAM: I mean, I'm sorry, not to be blunt, but, you
know. It's pretty obvious goblins are not welcome

574
00:43:35,824 --> 00:43:37,474
strolling about.

575
00:43:37,474 --> 00:43:39,123
LAURA: She's a goblin?!

576
00:43:39,123 --> 00:43:44,513
SAM: Yeah, yeah, but you don't have to make a big
thing of it, all right? There could be people here

577
00:43:44,513 --> 00:43:45,839
who don't know.

578
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:49,968
LIAM: That's right. She's my companion, she's my
friend. There's nothing to make a big deal about.

579
00:43:49,968 --> 00:43:54,308
That's why she's wrapped up. Just leave it,
please.

580
00:43:54,308 --> 00:43:56,146
LAURA: I didn't ask why she was wrapped up.

581
00:43:56,146 --> 00:43:59,220
MARISHA: I know, we're not making a big deal out
it. You're making a big deal out of it.

582
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,814
LIAM: Somebody asked why she was wrapped up.

583
00:44:00,814 --> 00:44:01,814
LAURA: No, nobody asked.

584
00:44:01,814 --> 00:44:04,466
LIAM: Somebody said the words-- this is Liam--
"Why are you all wrapped up?"

585
00:44:04,466 --> 00:44:08,105
MARISHA: Oh, I asked if she was cold.

586
00:44:08,105 --> 00:44:11,526
(laughter)

587
00:44:11,526 --> 00:44:12,902
SAM: That's concern.

588
00:44:12,902 --> 00:44:14,398
MATT: As Caleb finishes oversharing.

589
00:44:14,398 --> 00:44:17,379
LIAM: Vaxleth is over. It's so over!

590
00:44:17,379 --> 00:44:20,952
MARISHA: Those are old times, man. That was a
different universe. Different life.

591
00:44:20,952 --> 00:44:32,934
MATT: At this point, there is a bit of a commotion
towards the entrance of the tavern. Two shadows

592
00:44:32,934 --> 00:44:39,786
step into the doorway of the nearish-noonday sun.
The figures, one eclipsing the other from behind,

593
00:44:39,786 --> 00:44:46,226
begin to step in. You notice one of them begins to
step from table to table, glancing about with a

594
00:44:46,226 --> 00:44:51,962
sort of grace to the movement, the other staying a
few feet behind. Taliesin, if you'd like to

595
00:44:51,962 --> 00:44:53,505
describe your character, please.

596
00:44:53,505 --> 00:44:55,062
LAURA: I didn't think we were going to meet you so
soon!

597
00:44:55,062 --> 00:44:57,204
TALIESIN: Neither did I.

598
00:44:57,204 --> 00:44:58,474
ASHLEY: I didn't either.

599
00:44:58,474 --> 00:45:10,431
TALIESIN: But here we are. A lavender-- damn it,
Travis. A lavender tiefling with red eyes and very

600
00:45:10,431 --> 00:45:17,223
pierced, extremely ostentatious horns that are
pierced with little gems and little baubles. He's

601
00:45:17,223 --> 00:45:22,960
got a tattoo that seems to be running up the side
of his face, a peacock tattoo that goes off into

602
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:35,775
his very ostentatious, ridiculous, overblown robes
that he wears. His two swords and pouch dangling at

603
00:45:35,775 --> 00:45:42,785
the side of his hips. He's very broad in his
dress.

604
00:45:42,785 --> 00:45:44,924
LIAM: So a literal and figurative peacock.

605
00:45:44,924 --> 00:45:46,276
TALIESIN: Oh yes.

606
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:47,853
TRAVIS: One of your characters? No.

607
00:45:47,853 --> 00:45:49,483
TALIESIN: I know, mine. Who knew?

608
00:45:49,483 --> 00:45:54,312
MATT: As this tiefling darts from table to table,
a few feet behind, you see--

609
00:45:54,312 --> 00:45:56,890
ASHLEY: Wait, did you say your name?

610
00:45:56,890 --> 00:45:58,086
TALIESIN: I didn't say my name.

611
00:45:58,086 --> 00:46:09,153
ASHLEY: Okay. So there is a woman behind him. Taller
than your average... lass.

612
00:46:09,153 --> 00:46:12,700
(laughter)

613
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:25,126
ASHLEY: She's very, very, very pale-skinned. Her
hair is black that starts to turn white as it gets

614
00:46:25,126 --> 00:46:34,962
longer. It's matted, it's dreaded, it's braided.
Her clothes are a bit tattered, but just sort of--

615
00:46:34,962 --> 00:46:47,753
she's a bit of a mess, and she has two different
color eyes. One of them is a light greenish-blue,

616
00:46:47,753 --> 00:46:58,819
and the other is a violet color. And she's very
standoffish, hunch-y, arms folded.

617
00:46:58,819 --> 00:47:06,236
MATT: You watch as these figures slowly move from
table to table, the tiefling engaging in some

618
00:47:06,236 --> 00:47:12,943
distant conversation, leaving a slip of paper,
walking to the next table. Gauging the atmosphere,

619
00:47:12,943 --> 00:47:18,610
not leaving a slip of paper, and quickly moving
on, and then eventually your eyes meet what looks

620
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:24,084
to be two tables with a very motley crew of
individuals that are both awkwardly avoiding their

621
00:47:24,084 --> 00:47:26,795
own tension and currently trying to figure you
out.

622
00:47:26,795 --> 00:47:33,063
TALIESIN: Can I tell if-- where are they in the
dispensement of the coin? Can I tell they have a

623
00:47:33,063 --> 00:47:35,326
little coin on them? Did I catch any of that?

624
00:47:35,326 --> 00:47:39,124
MATT: They've completed distributing, so you don't
see any coin, unfortunately.

625
00:47:39,124 --> 00:47:47,245
TALIESIN: Well. I don't believe I've ever seen a
group of people more in need of a good time in my

626
00:47:47,245 --> 00:47:55,442
entire life. Mollymauk Tealeaf of the Fletching
and Moondrop Traveling Carnival of Curiosities. If

627
00:47:55,442 --> 00:48:01,639
there was ever a group of people that needed a
good time to go out, have a laugh, see things that

628
00:48:01,639 --> 00:48:07,055
you have never seen before, and my god, take my
word for it, one month's time, people will be

629
00:48:07,055 --> 00:48:12,848
buying your ale to hear the tale of what you saw
at the Traveling Carnival of Curiosities this night.

630
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:15,916
LAURA: We saw your tent going up! We did!

631
00:48:15,916 --> 00:48:20,801
MARISHA: We were actually going to go without the
flyer, but now we also have a flyer.

632
00:48:20,801 --> 00:48:25,863
TALIESIN: It's just five copper. A steal. At five
silver, it would be a steal, at five gold? Worth

633
00:48:25,863 --> 00:48:32,563
every penny. But if you've got the five copper to
spend, we would happily have you all.

634
00:48:32,563 --> 00:48:36,285
LAURA: Do you perform?

635
00:48:36,285 --> 00:48:43,621
TALIESIN: Ah. I'm less of a performer and more of
an intermediary for these parts. I do on occasion

636
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:46,313
perform. I can read fortunes--

637
00:48:46,313 --> 00:48:49,318
LAURA: (gasps) I was going to ask if you read
fortunes! Can you do one now?

638
00:48:49,318 --> 00:48:50,847
TALIESIN: I knew you were going to ask that.

639
00:48:50,847 --> 00:48:54,943
LAURA: (gasps) Oh my gosh, you're so smart. Look
at this guy, he knows everything!

640
00:48:54,943 --> 00:48:57,348
TALIESIN: I'm going to sit down at the table.

641
00:48:57,348 --> 00:49:01,963
MATT: Okay. He goes and sits down at this table,
finishing his presentation. One of the barmaids

642
00:49:01,963 --> 00:49:06,253
comes up to you, and looks up. You're standing
almost a solid seven inches taller than her.

643
00:49:06,253 --> 00:49:09,936
"Miss, can I get you a drink?"

644
00:49:09,936 --> 00:49:12,403
ASHLEY: (deadpan) Yes could I have a drink,
please. Just some ale.

645
00:49:12,403 --> 00:49:15,828
MATT: "Coming right up. Any preferences for the
family? Baumbauch?"

646
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:17,835
LAURA: Stay clear of Baumbauch. They're dicks.

647
00:49:17,835 --> 00:49:19,390
MARISHA: That's kind of true.

648
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:20,718
ASHLEY: Just a big.

649
00:49:20,718 --> 00:49:23,598
MATT: "Husseldorf, then. All right. Be right
back." And she wanders off.

650
00:49:23,598 --> 00:49:28,970
TALIESIN: Well. Who has coin for a fortune?

651
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:30,835
LAURA: Do you know my name?

652
00:49:30,835 --> 00:49:33,069
TALIESIN: What is your name?

653
00:49:33,069 --> 00:49:34,152
LAURA: Jester.

654
00:49:34,152 --> 00:49:35,323
TALIESIN: I know your name now!

655
00:49:35,323 --> 00:49:37,118
LAURA and TALIESIN: (laugh)

656
00:49:37,118 --> 00:49:38,410
LAURA: What is your name?

657
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:41,958
TALIESIN: Oh, my name is Molly to my friends, and
we're friends, now, aren't we? Pleasure.

658
00:49:41,958 --> 00:49:44,099
LAURA: Molly. Look at this guy.

659
00:49:44,099 --> 00:49:47,182
TALIESIN: Mollymauk. Molly for short. This is
Yasha, she's a charm.

660
00:49:47,182 --> 00:49:49,110
ASHLEY: Hello.

661
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:52,679
MARISHA: Yasha. Yasha.

662
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:55,294
TALIESIN: Now. Would anyone like a fortune read?

663
00:49:55,294 --> 00:49:56,479
LAURA: I would love one.

664
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:57,780
TALIESIN: Do you have coin?

665
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,476
LAURA: Yes. How much do you want?

666
00:49:59,476 --> 00:50:00,573
TALIESIN: Two copper.

667
00:50:00,573 --> 00:50:02,663
LAURA: Two copper, okay, I just got some copper.
Here you go.

668
00:50:02,663 --> 00:50:05,502
MATT: Mark down your two copper. (laughs)

669
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:14,984
TALIESIN: I am taking this in. All right. (sighs)
I'm going to try and do this.

670
00:50:14,984 --> 00:50:17,402
LAURA: Oh my gosh, really?

671
00:50:17,402 --> 00:50:27,866
MATT: So, as he pulls out a small set of cards and
begins to shuffle them, go ahead and roll an

672
00:50:27,866 --> 00:50:29,625
insight check.

673
00:50:29,625 --> 00:50:34,082
ASHLEY: (deadpan) He's really quite good, you
all should line up and get your fortunes told.

674
00:50:34,229 --> 00:50:36,141
(laughter)

675
00:50:36,141 --> 00:50:38,332
TALIESIN: Let's do a 16 there.

676
00:50:38,332 --> 00:50:43,773
MATT: Okay, so you get a brief conversation here,
you get a pretty solid read: the excitability, the

677
00:50:43,773 --> 00:50:49,836
eagerness, and the exuberant interest in just
getting in your face that this person wants-- any

678
00:50:49,836 --> 00:50:54,235
fortune you tell will probably suffice. Go ahead
and roll a sleight-of-hand check as well.

679
00:50:54,235 --> 00:50:57,084
SAM: Look at this fucking game!

680
00:50:57,084 --> 00:50:59,271
(laughter)

681
00:50:59,271 --> 00:51:00,671
TALIESIN: Also 16.

682
00:51:00,671 --> 00:51:08,713
MATT: Yeah. And you feel pretty confident that her
eyes are locked onto your eyes at the moment and

683
00:51:08,713 --> 00:51:13,265
not the deck, as you set up a proper reading. And
the cards are shuffled, set, you place them before

684
00:51:13,265 --> 00:51:15,016
you, and you may give your fortune.

685
00:51:15,016 --> 00:51:19,952
SAM: I'm going to just keep my eyes open for any
tricks of the hand, sleight-of-hand-y-type tricks.

686
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:21,233
MATT: Make a perception check.

687
00:51:21,233 --> 00:51:25,519
SAM: Okay. Perception. 14.

688
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:28,171
MATT: 14. All right. Everything seems pretty
above-board.

689
00:51:28,171 --> 00:51:37,027
TALIESIN: Your first card, the Silver Dragon. This
is good. You're pure, you're virtue, you are a

690
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:41,823
worthwhile and wonderful human being, obviously,
or creature of some repute.

691
00:51:41,823 --> 00:51:43,886
LAURA: That's what everyone always tells me.

692
00:51:43,886 --> 00:51:47,790
TALIESIN: It's true. And heading towards the
Anvil.

693
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:49,566
LAURA: What is that?

694
00:51:49,566 --> 00:51:51,109
TALIESIN: That is a destiny forged.

695
00:51:51,109 --> 00:51:53,150
ASHLEY: (deadpan) Ohh.

696
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:56,504
TALIESIN: There is something bright and
adventurous in your future.

697
00:51:56,504 --> 00:52:04,061
LAURA: Wow! You know, we did just defeat a really
big snake? So maybe there's even bigger things

698
00:52:04,061 --> 00:52:05,619
coming up, you know?

699
00:52:05,619 --> 00:52:07,085
TALIESIN: Can I make another roll?

700
00:52:07,085 --> 00:52:08,204
MATT: Sure.

701
00:52:08,204 --> 00:52:10,587
SAM: Ashley confirmed worst hype-man ever.

702
00:52:10,587 --> 00:52:13,163
(laughter)

703
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:14,413
TALIESIN: 19.

704
00:52:14,413 --> 00:52:18,447
MATT: Yeah, easy enough. Even with discerning eyes
at the table, you are at the top of your game.

705
00:52:18,447 --> 00:52:20,645
TALIESIN: The Serpent card appears. Of course you
did.

706
00:52:20,645 --> 00:52:24,752
LAURA: (gasps) Oh my gosh! Look at that! How did
you even do that?

707
00:52:24,752 --> 00:52:27,954
TALIESIN: That's all the cards. I'm simply a
vessel for higher powers.

708
00:52:27,954 --> 00:52:35,250
LIAM: While everybody's watching this shit happen,
may I cast Detect Magic?

709
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:43,038
MATT: You may. You lean back and subtly begin a brief
muttering of an incantation, your fingers wash

710
00:52:43,038 --> 00:52:51,849
through the air, a faint silver gleam across your
fingertips. Nothing magical shows up in the

711
00:52:51,849 --> 00:52:53,717
immediate vicinity.

712
00:52:53,717 --> 00:52:57,051
LAURA: Will you ask the cards if I'm going to find
him?

713
00:52:57,051 --> 00:53:01,126
TALIESIN: If you're going to find her?

714
00:53:01,126 --> 00:53:02,424
LAURA: Him.

715
00:53:02,424 --> 00:53:06,408
TALIESIN: Give me a little bit more. Who's this
'him' that you're looking for?

716
00:53:06,408 --> 00:53:08,360
LAURA: I'm looking for my dad.

717
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,764
TALIESIN: 14.

718
00:53:09,764 --> 00:53:14,255
MATT: You fumble for a second, but the card still
finds its way through without issue.

719
00:53:14,255 --> 00:53:25,776
TALIESIN: Pushing through, pushing through. The
Eye card pulls up. You've already found the clue

720
00:53:25,776 --> 00:53:27,916
you're looking for. You just don't know what it is
yet.

721
00:53:27,916 --> 00:53:29,398
LAURA: Really?

722
00:53:29,398 --> 00:53:33,017
TALIESIN: Apparently. Well, it's what the cards
are saying. It's right in front of you.

723
00:53:33,017 --> 00:53:35,845
LAURA: Wow. Does it say how long ago I found it?
Because that's--

724
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:38,183
TALIESIN: Sadly, I don't have that sort of
specifics. That's much more expensive.

725
00:53:38,183 --> 00:53:41,515
LAURA: That's going to take a lot of thinking.

726
00:53:41,515 --> 00:53:45,824
TALIESIN: Well, you find us at the show, you'll
find my tent and I'd be happy to give you a more

727
00:53:45,824 --> 00:53:47,023
complicated reading.

728
00:53:47,023 --> 00:53:48,565
LAURA: I can't wait! It's going to be so much
fun.

729
00:53:48,565 --> 00:53:49,682
TALIESIN: So much fun.

730
00:53:49,682 --> 00:53:54,469
MATT: Yasha, at this point, the barmaid, Adelaine,
comes up and hands you the ordered ale.

731
00:53:54,469 --> 00:53:57,034
ASHLEY: Thank you, my lady.

732
00:53:57,034 --> 00:53:59,153
MATT: "On the house."

733
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:00,706
TALIESIN: On the house!

734
00:54:00,706 --> 00:54:02,882
ASHLEY: That's very kind of you.

735
00:54:02,882 --> 00:54:05,192
MARISHA: Do you perform in the circus, too?

736
00:54:05,192 --> 00:54:10,997
ASHLEY: No. I do not. I just-- I put it up.

737
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:13,236
MARISHA: Oh, cool.

738
00:54:13,236 --> 00:54:15,428
TRAVIS: The tent.

739
00:54:15,428 --> 00:54:18,597
LAURA: It's a big tent. It would take a lot of
work.

740
00:54:18,597 --> 00:54:25,523
ASHLEY: I put up the stage, I move things around.
I'm very strong. But I don't do anything in the show.

741
00:54:25,523 --> 00:54:29,823
TALIESIN: Some of our acts are a little
complicated, with performers who are not of the

742
00:54:29,823 --> 00:54:34,689
traditional variety. Can make some of the locals
get a little shifty, if you know what I mean, and

743
00:54:34,689 --> 00:54:38,409
it's good to have a few people around who are
capable of keeping issues contained.

744
00:54:38,409 --> 00:54:43,109
MARISHA: Is that why it says 'No admittance to the
elderly'? You don't want to deal with those riley

745
00:54:43,109 --> 00:54:49,278
elderly. Or the ill, yeah. Why no elderly, though?
Ill kind of makes sense, but elderly?

746
00:54:49,278 --> 00:54:52,882
TALIESIN: We cannot be held responsible for
anything that may happen to someone who is ill or

747
00:54:52,882 --> 00:54:58,029
infirm. It is such an exciting, impressive show.

748
00:54:58,029 --> 00:55:03,086
ASHLEY: We've had people die watching it.
Yeah. It's just that exciting. Just from

749
00:55:03,086 --> 00:55:04,140
excitement.

750
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,044
TRAVIS: Did they die in the show, or from watching
it?

751
00:55:06,044 --> 00:55:08,926
ASHLEY: Yeah, just like heart attack. Just from
getting so excited, I guess.

752
00:55:08,926 --> 00:55:12,044
MARISHA: We gotta get so wasted.

753
00:55:12,044 --> 00:55:15,964
LAURA: When is it? How long is it? When is it?

754
00:55:15,964 --> 00:55:19,869
MATT: It is actually the day of Grissen, and your
first show is today.

755
00:55:19,869 --> 00:55:21,411
TALIESIN: First show is tonight.

756
00:55:21,411 --> 00:55:23,472
LAURA: Well, we have plans tonight!

757
00:55:23,472 --> 00:55:24,768
MARISHA: Yay!

758
00:55:24,768 --> 00:55:27,772
LAURA: Do you stinky people want to come with us?

759
00:55:27,772 --> 00:55:35,300
SAN: I-- Caleb, we don't have any plans tonight. I
guess we could go along. I wouldn't mind seeing it.

760
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,224
MARISHA: It'll be fun!

761
00:55:37,224 --> 00:55:40,962
TALIESIN: Or you could stay here and buy beer for
the people who do see the shows, and you can hear

762
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,594
all about it and pay more.

763
00:55:42,594 --> 00:55:44,339
LIAM: Yeah, we can go.

764
00:55:44,339 --> 00:55:46,410
LAURA: It's going to be so much fun.

765
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:49,845
SAM: Yeah, yeah, it sounds like a good night.
Yeah.

766
00:55:49,845 --> 00:55:53,771
LAURA: Look at all these friends we're making
here. This is a good city.

767
00:55:53,771 --> 00:55:57,066
SAM: Yeah, it is.

768
00:55:57,066 --> 00:55:58,498
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

769
00:55:58,498 --> 00:56:05,661
TALIESIN: You are all the most charming people I've
met in-- yes. I finish my beer. (sighs) Well, we'd

770
00:56:05,661 --> 00:56:06,954
better be getting on.

771
00:56:06,954 --> 00:56:10,331
ASHLEY: Yep, nice to meet you all. You're so, uh,
wonderful.

772
00:56:10,331 --> 00:56:14,928
TALIESIN: Charm. Pure charm. See you tonight!

773
00:56:14,928 --> 00:56:22,477
MATT: And as they leave you, Yasha just downs her
entire ale, slams it on the table, and they both

774
00:56:22,477 --> 00:56:27,756
walk out, passing a couple more flyers at off
tables, and then exit out to the rest of the day's

775
00:56:27,756 --> 00:56:29,790
sun beyond your sight.

776
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:32,219
MARISHA: She was awesome.

777
00:56:32,219 --> 00:56:33,758
TRAVIS: She didn't say much.

778
00:56:33,758 --> 00:56:35,570
MARISHA: That's why I liked her.

779
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:40,008
LAURA: She was really, really cool. Did you see
that cool thing she had going on with her chin?

780
00:56:40,008 --> 00:56:43,091
That's interesting. I wish I would have thought of
something like that.

781
00:56:43,091 --> 00:56:45,796
MARISHA: Yeah, I mean, you could maybe do
something like that in time. Just wait until

782
00:56:45,796 --> 00:56:46,881
maybe--

783
00:56:46,881 --> 00:56:48,575
LAURA: So she doesn't know I copied. I can't do it
tonight.

784
00:56:48,575 --> 00:56:49,845
MARISHA: No, no.

785
00:56:49,845 --> 00:56:55,785
LAURA: Wow. Cool. What do you guys want to do
now?

786
00:56:55,785 --> 00:56:57,786
(laughter)

787
00:56:57,786 --> 00:56:59,151
TRAVIS: Was he using magic?

788
00:56:59,151 --> 00:57:00,926
LAURA: I don't know.

789
00:57:00,926 --> 00:57:04,891
MARISHA: Are you-- you're superstitious. Yeah?

790
00:57:04,891 --> 00:57:06,025
LAURA: No.

791
00:57:06,025 --> 00:57:07,276
MARISHA: Okay.

792
00:57:07,276 --> 00:57:09,265
LAURA: No, I'm not superstitious at all.

793
00:57:09,265 --> 00:57:10,928
MARISHA: You-- sure.

794
00:57:10,928 --> 00:57:12,183
LAURA: Why?

795
00:57:12,183 --> 00:57:25,346
MARISHA: I mean, what he was working in was-- he
was doing a little like-- he-- he's a smart guy.

796
00:57:25,346 --> 00:57:26,551
He's a smart guy.

797
00:57:26,551 --> 00:57:27,896
LAURA: By the way, did you open your Christmas
present from me?

798
00:57:27,896 --> 00:57:28,881
TALIESIN: No, not yet, no.

799
00:57:28,881 --> 00:57:31,706
LAURA: You should go open it! Yes! Go grab the
bag!

800
00:57:31,706 --> 00:57:34,345
TALIESIN: On the break. On the break, I'll grab
it.

801
00:57:34,345 --> 00:57:41,768
SAM: Hey, Matt. Dungeon master. They're wearing
what they described. They're not wearing any

802
00:57:41,768 --> 00:57:44,169
cloaks or anything right now, are they?

803
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:48,478
MATT: Both of them have small cloaks over the
shoulders, Beau has a--

804
00:57:48,478 --> 00:57:49,887
SAM: Do I recognize those cloaks?

805
00:57:49,887 --> 00:57:52,395
MATT: No, you do not.

806
00:57:52,395 --> 00:57:55,932
LAURA: What? Why would you recognize the cloaks?

807
00:57:55,932 --> 00:57:59,992
SAM: Maybe I saw something. I don't know.

808
00:57:59,992 --> 00:58:02,757
MATT: No, you do not.

809
00:58:02,757 --> 00:58:04,376
SAM: I didn't see them last night?

810
00:58:04,376 --> 00:58:05,205
MATT: No.

811
00:58:05,205 --> 00:58:08,756
SAM: Okay. Interesting.

812
00:58:08,756 --> 00:58:10,697
MARISHA: Mysteries.

813
00:58:10,697 --> 00:58:18,691
LIAM: Also, for the record, there was nothing
magic about that. Maybe he's good at reading

814
00:58:18,691 --> 00:58:22,275
people, but that was not magic.

815
00:58:22,275 --> 00:58:27,534
SAM: Caleb knows everything about magic. He's been
even teaching me some. He's real good. You should

816
00:58:27,534 --> 00:58:28,622
see him--

817
00:58:28,622 --> 00:58:29,762
LIAM: Nott--

818
00:58:29,762 --> 00:58:31,931
LAURA: Caleb, are you going to go the Academy?

819
00:58:31,931 --> 00:58:34,798
LIAM: (strained laugh) That's silly.

820
00:58:34,798 --> 00:58:40,300
SAM: He could if he wanted to. He's really good at
magic. He can make a cat appear and disappear

821
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:41,569
whenever he wants.

822
00:58:41,569 --> 00:58:43,575
LAURA: Really? A cat?

823
00:58:43,575 --> 00:58:44,744
LIAM: (snaps)

824
00:58:44,744 --> 00:58:50,104
MATT: You watch as just beneath the table, this
orange patchy tabby leaps up.

825
00:58:50,104 --> 00:58:54,967
MARISHA: Oh, shit! What's his name?

826
00:58:54,967 --> 00:58:56,798
LAURA: Or her name!

827
00:58:56,798 --> 00:59:02,249
LIAM: Well, it is a he. This is my cat Frumpkin.
Frumpkin, yes.

828
00:59:02,249 --> 00:59:05,043
LAURA: Aw! Can I call him Lumpy?

829
00:59:05,043 --> 00:59:07,955
LIAM: You can call him Frumpkin.

830
00:59:07,955 --> 00:59:13,596
LAURA: Look at this Lumpy! Made in England.

831
00:59:13,596 --> 00:59:16,935
(laughter)

832
00:59:16,935 --> 00:59:19,784
LIAM: That was a little show gift from Marisha, so
this is Frumpkin.

833
00:59:19,784 --> 00:59:21,709
LAURA: That's so great.

834
00:59:21,709 --> 00:59:26,206
SAM: That's not all he can do. Caleb, tell them all
the stuff you can do. It's really impressive!

835
00:59:26,206 --> 00:59:28,523
LIAM: You know, sometimes less is more.

836
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:30,254
LAURA: I can do things, too.

837
00:59:30,254 --> 00:59:31,622
SAM: With magic?

838
00:59:31,622 --> 00:59:32,685
LAURA: Yeah.

839
00:59:32,685 --> 00:59:33,860
SAM: Like what?

840
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:34,952
LAURA: Like--

841
00:59:34,952 --> 00:59:36,365
SAM: Not to me, not to me!

842
00:59:36,365 --> 00:59:44,620
LAURA: Like-- oh, gosh. Okay. I'm going to use
Thaumaturgy and I'm going to make all the windows

843
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:47,651
in the place open up really fast, like crash
open.

844
00:59:47,651 --> 00:59:54,202
MATT: Okay. You watch as four of the nearby
windows slam open with a sudden burst of wind, and

845
00:59:54,202 --> 00:59:57,934
all the various bits of torchlight that light the
deeper and more shadowed corners of the room

846
00:59:57,934 --> 01:00:08,853
suddenly darken and flicker. The music suddenly
comes to a stop. Everyone holds their position and

847
01:00:08,853 --> 01:00:11,102
glances over at the table where you're all sitting.

848
01:00:11,102 --> 01:00:14,792
TRAVIS: Jester, don't you remember us talking
about keeping a low profile?

849
01:00:14,849 --> 01:00:18,959
LAURA: You're right. I'm sorry. I use Thaumaturgy
and I close all the windows.

850
01:00:18,959 --> 01:00:20,961
(laughter)

851
01:00:20,961 --> 01:00:26,661
MATT: They all slam shut a second time. The light
flickers and then brightens back to its normal place.

852
01:00:26,661 --> 01:00:28,823
LAURA: Ta-da!

853
01:00:28,823 --> 01:00:33,847
MARISHA: Yeah! Yeah!

854
01:00:33,847 --> 01:00:37,672
LAURA: Come see me tonight at the carnival! I'm
really good!

855
01:00:37,672 --> 01:00:45,377
MATT: One really crotchety-looking guy in his
early 50s with a super underbite, probably missing

856
01:00:45,377 --> 01:00:46,940
most of his teeth, just goes--

857
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:50,728
(laughter)

858
01:00:50,728 --> 01:00:57,210
LIAM: I telepathically tell Frumpkin to jump up
and sit in the lap of the woman in the monk's

859
01:00:57,210 --> 01:01:01,998
robes who just made a big scene and hopefully keep
her occupied with being cute.

860
01:01:01,998 --> 01:01:06,171
MATT: Okay. As soon as you sit down, Frumpkin
leaps into your lap and starts purring and rubbing

861
01:01:06,171 --> 01:01:07,491
up against your hand.

862
01:01:07,491 --> 01:01:16,503
MARISHA: Hey, buddy. Look at this kitty! I think
he likes me.

863
01:01:16,503 --> 01:01:18,820
LIAM: Sure, right now he likes you.

864
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:21,215
MARISHA: Is this a real cat? Or is this a fake
cat?

865
01:01:21,215 --> 01:01:22,657
LIAM: What do you mean, a fake cat?

866
01:01:22,657 --> 01:01:24,088
MARISHA: Like a magic cat.

867
01:01:24,088 --> 01:01:26,195
LIAM: He's both a real cat and a magic cat.

868
01:01:26,195 --> 01:01:27,823
MARISHA: Is he an illusion cat?

869
01:01:27,823 --> 01:01:30,795
LIAM: Do you feel him?

870
01:01:30,795 --> 01:01:33,033
TRAVIS: Could you put him over there?

871
01:01:33,033 --> 01:01:36,101
MARISHA: Are you allergic to Frumpkins? Oh no!

872
01:01:36,101 --> 01:01:39,537
LAURA: But he's a magic cat. How can you be
allergic to magic cats?

873
01:01:39,537 --> 01:01:41,673
TRAVIS: I'm pretty sure he's a real fucking cat.

874
01:01:41,673 --> 01:01:44,241
MARISHA: He's one of those hypoallergenic magic
cats.

875
01:01:44,241 --> 01:01:46,856
LIAM: I don't know what the Fifth Edition rules
are--

876
01:01:46,856 --> 01:01:49,093
LAURA: --for cat dander?

877
01:01:49,093 --> 01:01:53,915
MATT: As far as you know right now? Yeah, he's
having an actual allergic attack. A minor one.

878
01:01:53,915 --> 01:01:56,366
MARISHA: I walk away a little bit from Fjord.

879
01:01:56,366 --> 01:01:58,163
LIAM: Shit.

880
01:01:58,163 --> 01:02:03,979
(laughter)

881
01:02:04,041 --> 01:02:09,097
SAM: Well, you're both magic-users, then. And so
is the larger fellow?

882
01:02:09,097 --> 01:02:11,628
TRAVIS: Well, I mean, a little.

883
01:02:11,628 --> 01:02:14,038
LAURA: Yeah, I mean, he's learning. He's getting
really good at it.

884
01:02:14,038 --> 01:02:15,620
TRAVIS: Trying to learn more.

885
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:18,668
LAURA: Yeah, you should have seen him. He
disguised himself the other day, and it was like,

886
01:02:18,668 --> 01:02:19,937
(clicks tongue).

887
01:02:19,937 --> 01:02:23,478
TRAVIS: Thanks, Jester. She's better at it than I
am. We're trying to make our way up to the Academy

888
01:02:23,478 --> 01:02:26,323
to get a little bit more learning done.

889
01:02:26,323 --> 01:02:29,017
LAURA: Well, he's going to learn. I'm not going to
go to the Academy.

890
01:02:29,017 --> 01:02:31,510
MARISHA: Man, this Academy place keeps getting
brought up.

891
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:34,061
TRAVIS: Well yeah, it's the place to be.

892
01:02:34,061 --> 01:02:35,680
MARISHA: Okay.

893
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:39,978
SAM: I'm sorry, what Academy are we talking
about?

894
01:02:39,978 --> 01:02:41,656
TRAVIS: Solstryce Academy. You know.

895
01:02:41,656 --> 01:02:44,291
MATT: Soltryce.

896
01:02:44,291 --> 01:02:46,093
LAURA: Yeah, that one.

897
01:02:46,093 --> 01:02:47,761
SAM: The Soul Train Academy.

898
01:02:47,761 --> 01:02:51,044
LIAM: It's a very fancy place.

899
01:02:51,044 --> 01:02:52,683
TRAVIS: You know it.

900
01:02:52,683 --> 01:02:54,415
LIAM: I have heard of it.

901
01:02:54,415 --> 01:02:58,028
TRAVIS: And you have arcane talents as well.

902
01:02:58,028 --> 01:02:59,040
LIAM: Yeah.

903
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:02,010
LAURA: How long have you had yours?

904
01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:14,176
LIAM: That's a tricky question. I studied when I
was younger, and then I gave it up for a while. I

905
01:03:14,176 --> 01:03:18,367
picked it up again recently. It's all
book-learned.

906
01:03:18,367 --> 01:03:20,544
LAURA: Wow, that's cool.

907
01:03:20,544 --> 01:03:23,173
MARISHA: This was a good way to go for your
first.

908
01:03:23,173 --> 01:03:24,938
LAURA: A frickin' cat!

909
01:03:24,938 --> 01:03:32,480
MARISHA: This is kind of therapeutic. Making me
feel better, just about life in general.

910
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:33,431
TRAVIS: (sneezes)

911
01:03:33,431 --> 01:03:34,814
MARISHA: All right.

912
01:03:34,814 --> 01:03:42,150
SAM: He reads lots of books, Caleb does. He's very
smart. In fact, should we go looking for more

913
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:43,574
right now?

914
01:03:43,574 --> 01:03:46,468
LIAM: Maybe in a little while.

915
01:03:46,468 --> 01:03:48,376
LAURA: Can I see one of your books?

916
01:03:48,376 --> 01:03:57,297
LIAM: Well-- and I pull apart the lapels of my
coat. I have books in what modern-day people like

917
01:03:57,297 --> 01:03:59,898
to think of as holster-straps, but there's a book
hanging here.

918
01:03:59,898 --> 01:04:03,191
SAM: I think ancient people would call it a
holster as well.

919
01:04:03,191 --> 01:04:09,920
LIAM: Bap-bap-bap. The books are right here. I
have these, but these are heirlooms, family

920
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:19,645
heirlooms, so I don't share those, but-- no, I
like to read. That's all. And I'm a bit of a

921
01:04:19,645 --> 01:04:30,209
self-starter, so I have to find-- I mean, good
luck at the Academy. That's rough, I hear.

922
01:04:30,209 --> 01:04:35,143
TRAVIS: Do you know anything about it? We're just
going up. Beginner's luck.

923
01:04:35,143 --> 01:04:39,435
LAURA: We know it's rich people that go there. We
have to find a way to get you in.

924
01:04:39,435 --> 01:04:41,982
LIAM: All I know is how hard it is to get into.

925
01:04:41,982 --> 01:04:44,384
SAM: You don't have a lot of money, then?

926
01:04:44,384 --> 01:04:45,782
LAURA: Well.

927
01:04:45,782 --> 01:04:46,976
TRAVIS: No.

928
01:04:46,976 --> 01:04:48,739
LAURA: We had more.

929
01:04:48,739 --> 01:04:52,140
MARISHA: But then we lost it, but then we got it
back.

930
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:53,964
TRAVIS: Somebody has a gambling problem.

931
01:04:53,964 --> 01:04:56,103
SAM: Oh. Which one?

932
01:04:56,103 --> 01:04:58,406
LAURA: What's the name of it again?

933
01:04:58,406 --> 01:05:02,330
MATT: It is the Crick-Queen's Call.

934
01:05:02,330 --> 01:05:05,267
LAURA: Have you played it?

935
01:05:05,267 --> 01:05:06,914
SAM: No, I haven't.

936
01:05:06,914 --> 01:05:10,357
LAURA: I'll teach you someday. It's so much fun.

937
01:05:10,357 --> 01:05:11,569
SAM: It's a game?

938
01:05:11,569 --> 01:05:12,655
LAURA: Yes.

939
01:05:12,655 --> 01:05:16,799
SAM: Cards? All right. I might like to know that.

940
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:20,964
LAURA: I mean, I can teach you, if you want.

941
01:05:20,964 --> 01:05:22,941
SAM: Yes, I would like to know that.

942
01:05:22,941 --> 01:05:25,220
LAURA: Okay, I'll deal!

943
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:26,308
SAM: Oh, right now?

944
01:05:26,308 --> 01:05:27,945
LAURA: Yes, sure, this will be fun.

945
01:05:27,945 --> 01:05:29,104
SAM: Is this okay?

946
01:05:29,104 --> 01:05:34,966
LIAM: Listen, I would not be sitting here if it
were not for you. Do whatever you like.

947
01:05:34,966 --> 01:05:39,586
LAURA: Okay. You draw three cards. Well, I give
you three cards. So you use 3d6.

948
01:05:39,586 --> 01:05:41,077
SAM: 3d6.

949
01:05:41,077 --> 01:05:42,407
LAURA: Yeah.

950
01:05:42,407 --> 01:05:47,210
SAM: Got one. I'm not you. I have one of each
dice.

951
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:50,139
(laughter)

952
01:05:50,139 --> 01:05:55,173
LAURA: Okay. So hide your roll from me, because we
can't know. So first you have to ante up. How much

953
01:05:55,173 --> 01:05:56,965
coin do you want to put in?

954
01:05:56,965 --> 01:05:58,168
SAM: I'm out.

955
01:05:58,168 --> 01:06:00,185
(laughter)

956
01:06:00,185 --> 01:06:05,013
LIAM: It's all right. I will front some coin for
you to play this game.

957
01:06:05,013 --> 01:06:06,615
LAURA: Oh, great! How much do you want to front
him?

958
01:06:06,615 --> 01:06:11,129
LIAM: I will give you a silver piece.

959
01:06:11,129 --> 01:06:13,799
LAURA: A silver. Okay, this is great.

960
01:06:13,799 --> 01:06:15,480
SAM: Thank you, Caleb. Thank you.

961
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:16,869
LIAM: Wish I had more.

962
01:06:16,869 --> 01:06:19,662
LAURA: Okay. Am I doing this right?

963
01:06:19,662 --> 01:06:20,815
MATT: So far.

964
01:06:20,815 --> 01:06:30,551
LAURA: Now I'm going to give us three cards, so we
both roll, but we can't see. That's good. Okay.

965
01:06:30,551 --> 01:06:32,583
MARISHA: Don't say 'that's good'.

966
01:06:32,583 --> 01:06:35,162
LAURA: Bluffing. How do you know I wasn't?

967
01:06:35,162 --> 01:06:39,097
SAM: I'm going to try to change one of my cards.

968
01:06:39,097 --> 01:06:42,187
LAURA: No, wait, there's rules!

969
01:06:42,187 --> 01:06:44,654
SAM: Without you seeing.

970
01:06:44,654 --> 01:06:46,199
MATT: Make a sleight-of-hand check.

971
01:06:46,199 --> 01:06:50,178
SAM: 12 plus eight, so that's 20.

972
01:06:50,178 --> 01:06:54,224
MATT: Make a perception check.

973
01:06:54,224 --> 01:06:59,431
LAURA: No, he totally did it. She totally did it.
This is really hard, Sam.

974
01:06:59,431 --> 01:07:01,283
LIAM: You're only an hour and a half in.

975
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:03,099
SAM: This is my only skill, guys.

976
01:07:03,099 --> 01:07:07,994
LAURA: But, you know, that's my skill, too.

977
01:07:07,994 --> 01:07:09,230
SAM: Oh, shit.

978
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:12,565
LAURA: So I'm going to try to do it as well,
'cause that's my skill as well.

979
01:07:12,565 --> 01:07:14,714
MATT: Well, first, what'd you roll for--

980
01:07:14,714 --> 01:07:16,383
LAURA: I did not notice him doing it.

981
01:07:16,383 --> 01:07:18,386
MATT: Okay, yeah, so you only get to reroll one of
the dice.

982
01:07:18,386 --> 01:07:21,220
LAURA: Okay, so I'm going to try to reroll one of
my three, too.

983
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:25,060
MATT: Go ahead. So make a sleight-of-hand check.

984
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:29,190
LAURA: Oh, right. Oh, shit.

985
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:30,398
SAM: Do I notice her?

986
01:07:30,398 --> 01:07:31,703
MATT: Well, roll a perception check.

987
01:07:31,703 --> 01:07:32,832
SAM: Nope.

988
01:07:32,832 --> 01:07:33,846
LAURA: 13?

989
01:07:33,846 --> 01:07:36,963
SAM: No, I rolled three.

990
01:07:36,963 --> 01:07:48,544
LAURA: Okay. So the best hand you can get is three
of a kind. Then, after that, it's a straight. A

991
01:07:48,544 --> 01:07:56,533
high straight. Then a low straight. Then it's if
you get all evens, or if you get all odds, then

992
01:07:56,533 --> 01:08:02,627
it's two of a kind, then it's nothing, it's just
high card. Okay, but now we put in a second

993
01:08:02,627 --> 01:08:07,822
amount, because you can up the ante, and you get
one more card.

994
01:08:07,822 --> 01:08:09,098
SAM: I'm out.

995
01:08:09,098 --> 01:08:15,215
LAURA: No, but wait, wait, wait. You can put in
more money, and then I deal you a different card.

996
01:08:15,215 --> 01:08:18,887
You get to give a card back, and then I deal you
another card.

997
01:08:18,887 --> 01:08:21,056
SAM: Should I? Caleb, do you have any more?

998
01:08:21,056 --> 01:08:26,378
LIAM: Because you saved my life yesterday, you may
have one more silver piece.

999
01:08:26,378 --> 01:08:30,660
LAURA: One more silver. Okay, I'll keep it low,
too, because you're only doing the one. So I only

1000
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:32,427
put in one silver, too.

1001
01:08:32,427 --> 01:08:33,906
MATT: That's a four-silver pot.

1002
01:08:33,906 --> 01:08:38,912
LAURA: Yes. And now give one of your dice back,
whichever one you don't want, and roll it again.

1003
01:08:38,912 --> 01:08:40,877
MATT: So you get to reroll.

1004
01:08:40,877 --> 01:08:41,959
SAM: Okay, got it.

1005
01:08:41,959 --> 01:08:44,142
MATT: And you get to reroll one as well.

1006
01:08:44,142 --> 01:08:49,699
LAURA: I don't want to reroll any. Okay. Now you
show what you got and we'll see who wins.

1007
01:08:49,699 --> 01:08:51,773
SAM: I got a pair of fours.

1008
01:08:51,773 --> 01:08:53,366
LAURA: I got three fives.

1009
01:08:53,366 --> 01:08:57,281
SAM: I draw my shortsword.

1010
01:08:57,281 --> 01:08:59,728
(laughter)

1011
01:08:59,728 --> 01:09:01,932
MARISHA: I immediately grapple him.

1012
01:09:01,932 --> 01:09:08,446
MATT: Make an athletics check. You make an
acrobatics check.

1013
01:09:08,446 --> 01:09:11,817
SAM: Acrobatics? 24.

1014
01:09:11,817 --> 01:09:14,318
MARISHA: 14.

1015
01:09:14,318 --> 01:09:21,533
MATT: So the female goblin draws a shortsword. You
reach out to grab, and she slips out of your grasp

1016
01:09:21,533 --> 01:09:23,596
and is now holding the blade at the edge of the
table.

1017
01:09:23,596 --> 01:09:25,479
SAM: You're cheating. Somehow you're cheating.

1018
01:09:25,479 --> 01:09:31,364
LIAM: Nott, Nott, that's fine. That's fine. She
won my two silver pieces. We'll just leave it at that.

1019
01:09:31,364 --> 01:09:33,245
SAM: I'm sorry.

1020
01:09:33,245 --> 01:09:38,871
LIAM: That's okay. She's very jumpy sometimes. You
can understand; we've been living in the woods for

1021
01:09:38,871 --> 01:09:43,846
a long time. Every time we come near any place
like this, we're attacked, jumped, followed. So I

1022
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,217
apologize on behalf of--

1023
01:09:45,217 --> 01:09:47,442
SAM: That was stupid. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
done that. I'm sorry.

1024
01:09:47,442 --> 01:09:52,781
LAURA: No, it's okay. Just don't do it again. But
I'm sorry I took all this money from your friend.

1025
01:09:52,781 --> 01:09:54,340
LIAM: That's making it worse.

1026
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:56,505
TRAVIS: Maybe you could give some of it back.

1027
01:09:56,505 --> 01:10:00,070
LAURA: Why, though? But I won it.

1028
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:01,501
SAM: Your Laura is showing.

1029
01:10:01,501 --> 01:10:06,800
(laughter)

1030
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:12,906
LAURA: Tell you what. I'll give you-- none of it
back, I can't! Okay, here's one silver back--

1031
01:10:12,906 --> 01:10:14,203
LIAM: No, I insist.

1032
01:10:14,203 --> 01:10:21,532
LAURA: Okay, but I insist, all the money back. All
right, fine, it's mine, thank you. Yay.

1033
01:10:21,532 --> 01:10:23,502
SAM: I need another drink.

1034
01:10:23,502 --> 01:10:27,562
LIAM: A round of Trosts for both our tables,
please.

1035
01:10:27,562 --> 01:10:29,155
LAURA: See? Isn't that the most fun?

1036
01:10:29,155 --> 01:10:30,557
SAM: It's fun.

1037
01:10:30,557 --> 01:10:34,176
MATT: Yorda looks over and goes, "Any preference
of family?"

1038
01:10:34,176 --> 01:10:36,619
LIAM: Not Baumbauch.

1039
01:10:36,619 --> 01:10:38,280
MATT: "Von Brandt it is."

1040
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:43,726
MARISHA: I'm impressed that you stuck to taking a
guy's money in a training game.

1041
01:10:43,726 --> 01:10:46,517
LAURA: Right? Oh, wait, is that bad?

1042
01:10:46,517 --> 01:10:47,751
MARISHA: Meh.

1043
01:10:47,751 --> 01:10:51,938
LAURA: Well, I only learned last night, you guys.

1044
01:10:51,938 --> 01:10:53,766
LIAM: What is a training game?

1045
01:10:53,766 --> 01:10:56,380
MARISHA: Just meaning when she was teaching.

1046
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:58,832
LAURA: People took my money when I was learning.

1047
01:10:58,832 --> 01:11:02,652
LIAM: It's fine. It's water under the bridge. It's
fine. It's all right.

1048
01:11:02,652 --> 01:11:08,520
MATT: Another round is brought to your table. You
guys can share a solemn post-game drink amongst

1049
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:09,900
yourselves.

1050
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:11,944
LIAM: If you feel slightly worse, there's a drink
on me.

1051
01:11:11,944 --> 01:11:15,938
LAURA: Oh jeez, now I'm definitely giving you your
two silver back. Don't worry about it, man.

1052
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:19,277
(laughter)

1053
01:11:19,277 --> 01:11:21,710
SAM: She's just a couple of wild and crazy guys
over here.

1054
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:25,879
(laughter)

1055
01:11:25,879 --> 01:11:31,194
LAURA: Have my baked goods come out yet?

1056
01:11:31,194 --> 01:11:35,598
MATT: They have. Your meal's been presented for a
while now. You've had the opportunity to eat most

1057
01:11:35,598 --> 01:11:36,745
of your meal.

1058
01:11:36,745 --> 01:11:37,897
SAM: That's real.

1059
01:11:37,897 --> 01:11:41,814
MATT: That is actually real. That's the power of
imagination, Sam. That wasn't there a second ago.

1060
01:11:41,814 --> 01:11:43,152
TALIESIN: Bangarang!

1061
01:11:43,152 --> 01:11:44,900
(laughter)

1062
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:46,710
TALIESIN: Right there for you.

1063
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:54,441
MATT: So you all finish your independent meals and
decide to continue your conversations or go about

1064
01:11:54,441 --> 01:11:56,217
your business for the day.

1065
01:11:56,217 --> 01:11:58,267
LAURA: I just want to go to the carnival.

1066
01:11:58,267 --> 01:12:00,649
LIAM: That's later tonight, though, isn't it?

1067
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:03,793
MATT: If you have no other business, we can wait
until dusk.

1068
01:12:03,793 --> 01:12:09,231
SAM: Well, there's that board on the wall. Has
anything new been posted on the board?

1069
01:12:09,231 --> 01:12:18,682
MATT: You go ahead and take a look at it. There is
one sheet that pertains to somebody in the Hills

1070
01:12:18,682 --> 01:12:25,542
Ward looking for folks to go ahead and do an
extermination run near the southern portion of the

1071
01:12:25,542 --> 01:12:30,614
Ustaloch. It looks like there's what looks to be
a vole infestation.

1072
01:12:30,614 --> 01:12:33,549
TRAVIS: What the fuck is a vole?

1073
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:35,281
MATT: It's a small rat.

1074
01:12:35,281 --> 01:12:37,536
LAURA: Should we do it?

1075
01:12:37,536 --> 01:12:42,904
MARISHA: I mean, we have to kill Rodents of
Unusual Size.

1076
01:12:42,904 --> 01:12:44,830
SAM: That doesn't sound interesting to me at all.

1077
01:12:44,830 --> 01:12:47,463
TRAVIS: What else is there?

1078
01:12:47,463 --> 01:12:52,631
MATT: Currently, it looks like there was another
sheet that looks like most has been torn off. The

1079
01:12:52,631 --> 01:12:54,347
rest of the board is pretty empty at the moment.

1080
01:12:54,347 --> 01:12:56,018
LIAM: DM, did I tear that? I can't remember.

1081
01:12:56,018 --> 01:12:57,560
MATT: You did, yes.

1082
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:04,163
SAM: Wasn't it a delivery thing?

1083
01:13:04,163 --> 01:13:06,804
LIAM: That was what it was, yeah.

1084
01:13:06,804 --> 01:13:12,742
MATT: It was to help move and load crates at one
of the local breweries.

1085
01:13:12,742 --> 01:13:13,989
SAM: Fuck that.

1086
01:13:13,989 --> 01:13:17,484
LAURA: We've done that. It sucked so much.

1087
01:13:17,484 --> 01:13:18,617
SAM: You did that?

1088
01:13:18,617 --> 01:13:20,072
LAURA: Well, by mistake.

1089
01:13:20,072 --> 01:13:22,526
MARISHA: We played D&D and we moved crates for
eight hours.

1090
01:13:22,526 --> 01:13:24,199
(laughter)

1091
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:25,557
TRAVIS: We did, yeah.

1092
01:13:25,557 --> 01:13:26,781
MATT: Welcome to level two.

1093
01:13:26,781 --> 01:13:29,020
SAM: We said no to that job, thank you.

1094
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:31,431
TRAVIS: We get bored pretty easily.

1095
01:13:31,431 --> 01:13:38,571
MARISHA: We did, however, then gamble with the
other workers and then Jester-- yeah. Jester--

1096
01:13:38,571 --> 01:13:40,390
LAURA: Well, I lost it, but he made so much.

1097
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:44,227
TRAVIS: Maybe not out loud say that. Just a
thought.

1098
01:13:44,227 --> 01:13:47,040
MARISHA: Oh, that's right. We probably shouldn't.
We didn't make any money.

1099
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:50,232
LAURA: Do you guys want company? Do you want us to
come and hang out with you today?

1100
01:13:50,232 --> 01:13:53,181
SAM: I don't know about that. That sounds risky, I
don't know.

1101
01:13:53,181 --> 01:14:00,787
LIAM: Do you know something? I, shockingly, think
that's not a bad idea.

1102
01:14:00,787 --> 01:14:03,618
SAM: To have these weirdos with us?

1103
01:14:03,618 --> 01:14:05,722
LAURA: I can hear you.

1104
01:14:05,722 --> 01:14:08,970
LIAM: Yesterday was a very bad day.

1105
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:17,320
SAM: Yes. Well, I suppose if we surrounded
ourselves with weirdos, then maybe it would take

1106
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,978
some of heat off of me.

1107
01:14:18,978 --> 01:14:22,472
LIAM: Well, yes. Bottom line: can you hang with
the goblin?

1108
01:14:22,472 --> 01:14:28,721
LAURA: Bottom line-- and I touch Nott's shoulder,
and I cast Blessing of the Trickster.

1109
01:14:28,721 --> 01:14:31,424
SAM: Oh, Jesus, she's going to kill me right now.

1110
01:14:31,424 --> 01:14:32,976
(laughter)

1111
01:14:32,976 --> 01:14:36,463
SAM: Any magic kills a goblin instantly. Yeah,
instantly.

1112
01:14:36,463 --> 01:14:39,568
(laughter)

1113
01:14:39,568 --> 01:14:42,643
LAURA: That would be the worst character choice
ever.

1114
01:14:42,643 --> 01:14:45,294
(laughter)

1115
01:14:45,294 --> 01:14:50,938
LIAM: We will mourn her. Tschuss.

1116
01:14:50,938 --> 01:15:02,607
MATT: Okay, so there's a slight sense of warmth
that emanates from under her hand, and for a

1117
01:15:02,607 --> 01:15:07,931
moment, you look over and glance instinctively,
ready to almost draw your sword again. But it

1118
01:15:07,931 --> 01:15:12,869
seems to quicken your reflexes. You have this
surge of adrenaline that doesn't quite fade.

1119
01:15:12,869 --> 01:15:16,425
LAURA: You have advantage on all your stealth
checks.

1120
01:15:16,425 --> 01:15:17,854
MATT: For the next hour.

1121
01:15:17,854 --> 01:15:21,140
SAM: Thank you. That's very nice.

1122
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:27,214
TRAVIS: I don't have a problem with goblins, but
you guys aren't in any trouble, are you? No one's

1123
01:15:27,214 --> 01:15:28,711
after you?

1124
01:15:28,711 --> 01:15:31,571
LAURA: Because she is all kinds of trouble.

1125
01:15:31,571 --> 01:15:33,836
SAM: No one is after me!

1126
01:15:33,836 --> 01:15:36,366
TRAVIS: Can I make an insight check?

1127
01:15:36,366 --> 01:15:37,498
MATT: You may.

1128
01:15:37,498 --> 01:15:41,357
(laughter)

1129
01:15:41,357 --> 01:15:43,762
TRAVIS: 13.

1130
01:15:43,762 --> 01:15:48,817
MATT: 13. If you want to go ahead and try and
lie.

1131
01:15:48,817 --> 01:15:54,936
SAM: That's a 14, except negative three to
performance.

1132
01:15:54,936 --> 01:16:01,099
TALIESIN: I've been waiting for this for so long.

1133
01:16:01,099 --> 01:16:04,274
SAM: So 11.

1134
01:16:04,274 --> 01:16:06,410
MATT: So, are you lying?

1135
01:16:06,410 --> 01:16:11,635
SAM: I am lying. I am definitely on the run from
someone.

1136
01:16:11,635 --> 01:16:14,602
TRAVIS: Good to know.

1137
01:16:14,602 --> 01:16:25,662
MARISHA: So. Mask. I'm just fascinated by the
mask. Looks well-made. Did you make it?

1138
01:16:25,662 --> 01:16:29,229
SAM: That's a good fucking question. Did I make
it?

1139
01:16:29,229 --> 01:16:31,571
(laughter)

1140
01:16:31,571 --> 01:16:33,520
SAM: I don't make things.

1141
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:36,969
MATT: No, I presume-- and we discussed this a
little bit-- we presume it may have been scavenged

1142
01:16:36,969 --> 01:16:38,568
from a porcelain doll.

1143
01:16:38,568 --> 01:16:42,362
SAM: Oh, that's cool. Cool and gross, cool and
gross.

1144
01:16:42,362 --> 01:16:45,789
LAURA: What's her name? The creepy doll?

1145
01:16:45,789 --> 01:16:48,049
TRAVIS: Annabelle.

1146
01:16:48,049 --> 01:16:52,510
(laughter)

1147
01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:55,272
LAURA: No, don't say that. I don't want to see art
with you with Annabelle's face.

1148
01:16:55,272 --> 01:16:56,835
SAM: Too late.

1149
01:16:56,835 --> 01:16:58,398
MATT: The internet's running with that now.

1150
01:16:58,398 --> 01:17:00,109
SAM: Check your Twitter.

1151
01:17:00,109 --> 01:17:03,839
TRAVIS: It seems we have all day. What were your
plans?

1152
01:17:03,839 --> 01:17:12,343
LIAM: Not much. We were going to sample the
different Trosts, and I wanted to maybe do some

1153
01:17:12,343 --> 01:17:14,566
book browsing. Nothing major.

1154
01:17:14,566 --> 01:17:15,896
LAURA: What's a Trost?

1155
01:17:15,896 --> 01:17:17,429
MARISHA: Brewery tour!

1156
01:17:17,429 --> 01:17:18,677
SAM: It's ale.

1157
01:17:18,677 --> 01:17:21,393
LAURA: We just can't go by the Baumbauch ale.

1158
01:17:21,393 --> 01:17:23,466
SAM: What happened with the Baumbauchs?

1159
01:17:23,466 --> 01:17:25,183
LIAM: There are two others to choose from, here.

1160
01:17:25,183 --> 01:17:29,922
MARISHA: They're who we loaded crates for, and
then we kind of swindled their employee.

1161
01:17:29,922 --> 01:17:31,623
TRAVIS: Didn't leave on the best of terms.

1162
01:17:31,623 --> 01:17:37,761
LIAM: DM, which one is the one that everybody
knows has got the blessing of Fryda Langer?

1163
01:17:37,761 --> 01:17:41,777
MATT: No, that is actually the Baumbauch.

1164
01:17:41,777 --> 01:17:42,959
LIAM: Shit.

1165
01:17:42,959 --> 01:17:46,724
MATT: Yeah, the Starosta is kind of tied with the
Baumbauch family.

1166
01:17:46,724 --> 01:17:49,004
TALIESIN: We're imaginary beer snobs now.

1167
01:17:49,004 --> 01:17:50,752
LAURA: Is that the one you need?

1168
01:17:50,752 --> 01:17:55,853
LIAM: No, I'm just saying the one that you
swindled, it's got the blessing of the big cheese here.

1169
01:17:55,853 --> 01:18:02,277
LAURA: Oh. Well. Why do you need it?

1170
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:08,891
LIAM: We don't need it. It's just pleasurable to
have a Trost, is what they say. She kind of needs it.

1171
01:18:08,891 --> 01:18:10,752
SAM: I need it a little bit.

1172
01:18:10,752 --> 01:18:12,343
LAURA: You need a beer?

1173
01:18:12,343 --> 01:18:19,406
SAM: Well, I prefer the harder stuff, but I'll
take what I can get at this point. Yeah, I'm

1174
01:18:19,406 --> 01:18:21,986
sticking with this fucking accent for the next two
years.

1175
01:18:21,986 --> 01:18:28,364
(laughter)

1176
01:18:28,364 --> 01:18:30,480
TRAVIS: Laryngitis every Friday.

1177
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:35,189
(laughter)

1178
01:18:35,189 --> 01:18:42,469
MARISHA: So beer tour, then circus?

1179
01:18:42,469 --> 01:18:48,763
LAURA: I've got to say, I miss those two people we
ran into at the carnival.

1180
01:18:48,763 --> 01:18:50,845
TRAVIS: I might just wait for the carnival,
actually.

1181
01:18:50,845 --> 01:18:58,700
MARISHA: Well, if we just montage through a beer
tour, we'll quickly get to the circus. To the

1182
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:04,186
carnival!

1183
01:19:04,186 --> 01:19:06,003
MATT: You can totally do that.

1184
01:19:06,003 --> 01:19:11,257
LIAM: Can we just bring my book-browsing down to a
single roll to see if anything of use--

1185
01:19:11,257 --> 01:19:14,972
MATT: Yeah, we can do that. We'll say, if you guys
decide to go ahead and travel, the five of you,

1186
01:19:14,972 --> 01:19:20,401
you make your way through the town for the day,
you coast around the Husseldorf family brewery,

1187
01:19:20,401 --> 01:19:29,448
you meet Voss and June, who are the two very nice
ladies who run the facility. The Husseldorf

1188
01:19:29,448 --> 01:19:37,698
family. You avoid the Baumbauch, but can acquire
Baumbauch ale from other taverns in the town, of

1189
01:19:37,698 --> 01:19:43,953
course. And the von Brandt family brewery. All of them, as
soon as you say 'Trost', they correct you and say

1190
01:19:43,953 --> 01:19:50,480
the family name. They're very intent on getting
rid of the name 'Trost' as an overall, discussion

1191
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:54,914
of Trost-brand brews, and trying to make it their
family name. There's an offense, to the point

1192
01:19:54,914 --> 01:19:56,565
where you're like, "Oh, Jesus. I didn't realize."

1193
01:19:56,565 --> 01:19:58,986
TALIESIN: Like Kleenex and tissue paper? All
right.

1194
01:19:58,986 --> 01:20:02,336
MATT: But you manage to get nice and sauced
throughout the day.

1195
01:20:02,336 --> 01:20:09,002
LIAM: I take it easy. I have one more in the first
half of the day, and one in the second half.

1196
01:20:09,002 --> 01:20:09,859
MATT: Okay.

1197
01:20:09,859 --> 01:20:11,064
LAURA: I don't have very much either.

1198
01:20:11,064 --> 01:20:11,986
MATT: Okay.

1199
01:20:11,986 --> 01:20:13,444
SAM: I'm going to have tons.

1200
01:20:13,444 --> 01:20:14,527
MARISHA: I get sauced.

1201
01:20:14,527 --> 01:20:16,082
MATT: All right, well, that being the case--

1202
01:20:16,082 --> 01:20:18,944
LIAM: --you are poisoned.

1203
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:21,324
MATT: No, make a constitution saving throw.

1204
01:20:21,324 --> 01:20:25,457
SAM: Well, that was crazy. 12.

1205
01:20:25,457 --> 01:20:33,225
MATT: 12, okay. You get a little woozy for a
while, and as the sun begins to crawl towards the

1206
01:20:33,225 --> 01:20:40,154
distant horizon, you do not manage to allow your
meal to usurp your control.

1207
01:20:40,154 --> 01:20:41,962
LAURA: Aw, it's like Ren Faire.

1208
01:20:41,962 --> 01:20:44,110
MATT: Yeah. Don't remind me.

1209
01:20:44,110 --> 01:20:46,351
MARISHA: Good times, good times.

1210
01:20:46,351 --> 01:20:53,823
MATT: So as the day comes to a close, you're
fairly tipsy, you're not fully intoxicated. For

1211
01:20:53,823 --> 01:20:57,958
your trip, you wanted to head to the Hillsbrook
Parchment and Binding.

1212
01:20:57,958 --> 01:21:02,330
LIAM: Is that where I went the last time? Except
not as myself. So I'll go as myself.

1213
01:21:02,330 --> 01:21:04,051
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an investigation
check.

1214
01:21:04,051 --> 01:21:09,055
LIAM: All right. Don't fuck me, Vax. That is--

1215
01:21:09,055 --> 01:21:12,434
LAURA: That's Vax. That's Vax's dice.

1216
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:17,220
LIAM: Yeah, the thing about even a light German
accent is that when you say "Vex" and "Vax", it's

1217
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:18,703
the same shit.

1218
01:21:18,703 --> 01:21:20,803
(laughter)

1219
01:21:20,803 --> 01:21:23,601
LIAM: That is a 12.

1220
01:21:23,601 --> 01:21:30,097
MATT: 12. You take the better part of 30 minutes
or so, and you find there's a lot of books on

1221
01:21:30,097 --> 01:21:37,384
farming techniques. There's a lot of books about
how to grow, care for different types of

1222
01:21:37,384 --> 01:21:45,141
vegetation, plants, various beasts of burden. You
find books on the different seasons and what's

1223
01:21:45,141 --> 01:21:53,151
best for different types of grain and wheats. You
manage to pull through and find a couple of books

1224
01:21:53,151 --> 01:22:00,584
that deal with discussion of the Menagerie Coast
that talk about what's called the Clovis Concord.

1225
01:22:00,584 --> 01:22:05,767
It's more of a discussion of the political
structure that maintains all the city-states there.

1226
01:22:05,767 --> 01:22:10,853
LIAM: And the person who ran this place was an
older man, right? Just sipping tea.

1227
01:22:10,853 --> 01:22:12,411
MATT: Yeah, Sheenah, yeah.

1228
01:22:12,411 --> 01:22:20,366
LIAM: I'm sorry. You have a nice selection here.
Do you mind if I ask-- I haven't seen any other

1229
01:22:20,366 --> 01:22:28,955
booksellers of any kind in town. I'm not really
looking for anything on farming, so much. Is there

1230
01:22:28,955 --> 01:22:32,235
anywhere else I could look into?

1231
01:22:32,235 --> 01:22:40,801
MATT: "If you're looking for some sort of a
library, your best bet is to go to Zadash up north."

1232
01:22:40,801 --> 01:22:42,664
LIAM: Zadash.

1233
01:22:42,664 --> 01:22:48,116
MATT: "That's where the Library of the Cobalt Soul
resides. They have all the information you could

1234
01:22:48,116 --> 01:22:55,485
"hope for. A bit pricey to peruse their interior,
unless you have proper coverage, but unfortunately

1235
01:22:55,485 --> 01:23:01,376
"if what we have isn't what you're looking for, I
can't help you."

1236
01:23:01,376 --> 01:23:08,413
LIAM: No, it's a fine selection. Sorry. How much
for this book on hoe technique?

1237
01:23:08,413 --> 01:23:16,299
MATT: "Oh! Jamieson's Hoedown, yes, quite. That
will be two silver pieces."

1238
01:23:16,299 --> 01:23:23,342
LIAM: Oh. I'm very embarrassed, I'm sorry, I gave
away my last two silver pieces.

1239
01:23:23,342 --> 01:23:24,905
LAURA: No, I gave it back to you, remember?

1240
01:23:24,905 --> 01:23:32,729
LIAM: I gave away my last two silver pieces, so.
Maybe I can earn it back and come back later this week.

1241
01:23:32,729 --> 01:23:35,196
MATT: "Please do. Do you want me to hold it for
you?"

1242
01:23:35,196 --> 01:23:36,456
LIAM: Yes.

1243
01:23:36,456 --> 01:23:38,128
MATT: "What's your name?"

1244
01:23:38,128 --> 01:23:41,187
LIAM: My name is Caleb Widogast.

1245
01:23:41,187 --> 01:23:46,231
MATT: "All right. I will keep it here under the
shelf. Thank you so much."

1246
01:23:46,231 --> 01:23:48,343
LIAM: Okay, good day, thank you.

1247
01:23:48,343 --> 01:23:49,882
LAURA: Is this a big shop?

1248
01:23:49,882 --> 01:23:55,584
MATT: It's a boutique. It's designed almost like a
cross. There's two cross-sections of hallways that

1249
01:23:55,584 --> 01:24:00,014
have books across the walls, and there's a window
at the end of each and then a door at the far back.

1250
01:24:00,014 --> 01:24:06,036
LAURA: While he was talking to the shopkeeper, I'm
going to take out as many books as I can and move

1251
01:24:06,036 --> 01:24:10,818
them around on the shelves, and then take some of
them and turn them around to where their binding

1252
01:24:10,818 --> 01:24:12,467
is facing the inside.

1253
01:24:12,467 --> 01:24:14,768
MATT: Go ahead and make a sleight-of-hand check.

1254
01:24:14,768 --> 01:24:18,308
LAURA: Natural 20!

1255
01:24:18,308 --> 01:24:23,169
MATT: Over the period of him searching and
distracting this man, you have completely

1256
01:24:23,169 --> 01:24:31,503
rearranged the interior of this bookstore, to the
point where even in the far corner, you

1257
01:24:31,503 --> 01:24:35,508
Ghostbusters stack them in the center of the room,
floor-to-ceiling, with him not even noticing it.

1258
01:24:35,508 --> 01:24:38,301
LIAM: You little fucking poltergeist.

1259
01:24:38,301 --> 01:24:45,281
MATT: You feel confident and happy and a sensation
of approval washes over you. All right, so.

1260
01:24:45,281 --> 01:24:47,160
LAURA: I skip out the door.

1261
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:51,692
MATT: Okay. You turn around from having this
conversation and notice the interior is not as you

1262
01:24:51,692 --> 01:24:56,174
last saw it, and a bit of nerves begin to brew up
under you.

1263
01:24:56,174 --> 01:24:58,500
LIAM: Frumpkin, come on.

1264
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:00,518
MATT: (meows) Frumpkin follows behind.

1265
01:25:00,518 --> 01:25:04,323
LIAM: Oh yes! Matt's got to make cat sounds now!

1266
01:25:04,323 --> 01:25:09,307
MATT: I didn't even think about that until now.
God damn it. All right, so as you guys have

1267
01:25:09,307 --> 01:25:16,893
gathered at this point, the oranges and the pinks
of dusk begin to peek through the quite-cloudy

1268
01:25:16,893 --> 01:25:22,762
sky, the chilled air of the coming night sky
signalling the Crown's Guard to begin lighting the

1269
01:25:22,829 --> 01:25:27,282
hanging lanterns that line the streets of
Trostenwald. A renewed energy takes the streets as

1270
01:25:27,282 --> 01:25:34,694
the sound of a fiddle seems to creep through the
night air.

1271
01:25:34,694 --> 01:25:36,615
SAM: My god, Ashley's a master fiddler, isn't
she?

1272
01:25:36,615 --> 01:25:37,698
ASHLEY: Beedle-deedle.

1273
01:25:37,698 --> 01:25:40,215
(laughter)

1274
01:25:40,215 --> 01:25:44,060
TRAVIS: I love how your fiddle noises were
"beedle-deedle".

1275
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:48,975
ASHLEY: That's the sound for all instruments,
right?

1276
01:25:48,975 --> 01:25:51,998
SAM: Drums.

1277
01:25:51,998 --> 01:25:59,392
LIAM: By the way, DM, can I ask-- sometime in the
entire day, when Nott was getting wasted, could I

1278
01:25:59,392 --> 01:26:04,045
have spent an hour using Arcane Recovery to gain
back that one spell slot I used this morning?

1279
01:26:04,045 --> 01:26:12,231
MATT: Sure, yeah. I'll allow that. All right.
Folks begin to prod their heads out into the open

1280
01:26:12,231 --> 01:26:17,605
air, curious about the source of this unusual din,
and you find your vision capturing a small

1281
01:26:17,605 --> 01:26:23,626
procession of flamboyantly dressed people parading
through the central road. A lanky man of some

1282
01:26:23,626 --> 01:26:29,823
obvious elven descent leads the pack, his long,
ashy-brown hair curling ever-so-slightly past his

1283
01:26:29,823 --> 01:26:36,851
mid-back, his long coat and tails knocking around
by his skipping step. Two halfling women in purple

1284
01:26:36,851 --> 01:26:43,022
and green bodysuits dance from side to side,
handing flowers to children and flyers to adults,

1285
01:26:43,022 --> 01:26:50,049
as a bald man in a neck-frilled frock coat of
bright red, his face adorned in vibrant orange

1286
01:26:50,049 --> 01:26:55,629
makeup to look like the setting sun behind him,
plays the violin that you heard earlier in an

1287
01:26:55,629 --> 01:27:03,193
upbeat, jovial manner. A tall half-orc masculine
man with a well-groomed handlebar mustache that

1288
01:27:03,193 --> 01:27:08,448
curves out to the side, billowing white silk shirt
and black trousers, follows behind with a big drum

1289
01:27:08,448 --> 01:27:16,098
slung over his shoulder, going (drumming) along with the
fiddle. The tiefling man of lavender skin that you

1290
01:27:16,098 --> 01:27:23,518
saw earlier walks along with a grin, juggling two
curved scimitars as he walks in place, almost

1291
01:27:23,518 --> 01:27:28,097
loses one and catches it, continues to go.
Families are beginning to gather out to see this

1292
01:27:28,097 --> 01:27:37,261
display. The two dancers part, and then a woman of
short, fiery red hair and dark skin walking

1293
01:27:37,261 --> 01:27:42,838
between them, lifting a small candle before--
fwoosh! A giant burst, a gout of flame emerges

1294
01:27:42,838 --> 01:27:46,764
from the front of her mouth, brightens the
vicinity, and everyone collectively gasps and

1295
01:27:46,764 --> 01:27:54,289
begins cheering and clapping as they continue the
walk. There, to the back of it, you see the rather

1296
01:27:54,289 --> 01:28:00,490
burly-looking pale woman, arms crossed, just
following behind and keeping an eye like a

1297
01:28:00,490 --> 01:28:06,675
security guard to ensure that no business gets out
of hand. The gasps and the cheers begin to follow,

1298
01:28:06,675 --> 01:28:11,377
and as the procession continues down its way, the
families and civilians begin to gather and follow

1299
01:28:11,377 --> 01:28:19,173
behind. As the last bit of the sun sets behind the
mountain range, the torches glowing, the

1300
01:28:19,173 --> 01:28:24,697
procession curves through the center of the Loch
Ward to the edge of the Ustaloch itself. Through

1301
01:28:24,697 --> 01:28:28,297
the fishing village, more folks begin to gather.
Do you all follow?

1302
01:28:28,297 --> 01:28:30,456
ALL: Yeah.

1303
01:28:30,456 --> 01:28:33,741
LAURA: And I cast Blessing of the Trickster on you
again, just in case.

1304
01:28:33,741 --> 01:28:35,284
SAM: Thank you.

1305
01:28:35,284 --> 01:28:40,205
MATT: People following the parade, you see faces,
eager for this fresh form of entertainment.

1306
01:28:40,205 --> 01:28:44,947
Children laugh and chatter excitedly, while the
Crown's Guard in their familiar bronze and

1307
01:28:44,947 --> 01:28:50,560
vermilion uniform try to maintain order between
themselves being quite curious or visibly

1308
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:57,028
mistrusting of these hooligans that suddenly have
usurped the evening air. The procession continues

1309
01:28:57,028 --> 01:29:04,174
towards the eastern side, out along the southern
edge of this Loch Ward, to the Ustaloch's

1310
01:29:04,174 --> 01:29:11,500
southern place, towards the new, completely
constructed, large, dark blue tent. Lengthy

1311
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:17,402
streamers of white and silver flap with the cold
winds from the top of the structure. As you guys

1312
01:29:17,402 --> 01:29:23,660
walk, you watch as the horned tiefling you had
approached earlier slowly saunters up to your

1313
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:26,346
side, you recognizing these individuals you had
spoken with earlier.

1314
01:29:26,346 --> 01:29:28,352
MARISHA: I go, Molly! Molly, hey!

1315
01:29:28,352 --> 01:29:30,211
TALIESIN: Oh, it's my favorites. Hello.

1316
01:29:30,211 --> 01:29:32,139
LAURA: We came!

1317
01:29:32,139 --> 01:29:35,380
TALIESIN: I'm so glad you all came to see the
show. It's going to be great tonight.

1318
01:29:35,380 --> 01:29:37,729
ASHLEY: (deadpan) It's going to blow you away.

1319
01:29:37,729 --> 01:29:39,828
(laughter)

1320
01:29:39,828 --> 01:29:41,324
SAM: The hype continues.

1321
01:29:41,324 --> 01:29:45,052
ASHLEY: You're going to love it.

1322
01:29:45,052 --> 01:29:49,504
TALIESIN: First show of a round's always the best.
Without fail.

1323
01:29:49,504 --> 01:29:52,179
MARISHA: Where are the best seats?

1324
01:29:52,179 --> 01:29:58,133
TALIESIN: Well, I'm always partial to the front.
Then you're right in it, if something goes wrong,

1325
01:29:58,133 --> 01:30:04,248
it's nothing between you and whatever terrible,
bloody mess is going to happen. It's just the best.

1326
01:30:04,248 --> 01:30:05,810
MARISHA: What?

1327
01:30:05,810 --> 01:30:07,245
TALIESIN: Nothing, nothing, you're fine.

1328
01:30:07,245 --> 01:30:11,992
ASHLEY: It's going to be great, but before you go
in, I do have to give you guys a pat-down, 'cause

1329
01:30:11,992 --> 01:30:13,651
you can't go in with any weapons.

1330
01:30:13,651 --> 01:30:20,013
MATT: At this point, a voice rings out behind you,
you see as the carnival master Gustav glances over

1331
01:30:20,013 --> 01:30:24,141
your shoulder and goes, "You two, skip ahead,
quick. We need to go ahead and set up. Looks like

1332
01:30:24,141 --> 01:30:28,753
"we're already having quite a few people excited to
come here, so at the door, interior to set up.

1333
01:30:28,753 --> 01:30:32,312
"Meet us at the front. Actually, you know what?
You'll be on card duty. We need a little extra

1334
01:30:32,312 --> 01:30:33,687
"change on the side."

1335
01:30:33,687 --> 01:30:35,084
TALIESIN: Card duty it is.

1336
01:30:35,084 --> 01:30:39,447
MATT: "All right. Folks, excited for your
patronage." As he spins around and addresses the

1337
01:30:39,447 --> 01:30:44,833
whole crowd now and says, "Enjoy the night air.
Walk slowly. We need just a moment to set up." And

1338
01:30:44,833 --> 01:30:49,606
the half-elf man bows and tips his large-- it
looks almost like a top hat that gets floppy

1339
01:30:49,606 --> 01:30:54,141
towards the top and flops forward, and he puts it
back on top and begins sauntering, continuing the

1340
01:30:54,141 --> 01:30:58,316
music, but picking up their pace to get ahead of
the crowd as they draw you all slowly towards the

1341
01:30:58,316 --> 01:31:02,532
exterior tent. And that's where we're going to go
ahead and take our break.

1342
01:31:02,532 --> 01:31:04,635
(yelling)

1343
01:31:04,635 --> 01:31:06,904
TRAVIS: Face is on fire.

1344
01:31:06,904 --> 01:31:10,886
LAURA: Am I the only one going, do we really have
to give up our weapons? I don't feel okay with this.

1345
01:31:10,886 --> 01:31:15,869
SAM: Ashley, I'll do whatever you want, but if you
take my weapons I might kill you.

1346
01:31:15,869 --> 01:31:18,102
ASHLEY: I'd like to see you try.

1347
01:31:18,102 --> 01:31:20,549
(yelling)

1348
01:31:20,549 --> 01:31:24,944
MATT: All right, so. We'll be back here in a few
minutes. We're going to take a quick break. We

1349
01:31:24,944 --> 01:31:30,184
have our weekly giveaway from our friends at
Wyrmwood. We have a white oak complete dice tower

1350
01:31:30,184 --> 01:31:35,846
system that's a three-piece set. That's going to
be given away to one of you there in the chat. The

1351
01:31:35,846 --> 01:31:48,075
password, if I recall, is 'beginnings'. Yeah. This
one. If you're in the Twitch chat, if you want to

1352
01:31:48,075 --> 01:31:51,563
be part of this, when you're prompted there, go
ahead and enter the word 'beginnings' once. If you

1353
01:31:51,563 --> 01:31:56,940
enter it more than once, you'll get disqualified,
so be careful with that. Otherwise, it gets this

1354
01:31:56,940 --> 01:32:01,705
spamming spree of chaos. So the word is
'beginnings'. When prompted, go ahead and enter

1355
01:32:01,705 --> 01:32:04,865
that, and we'll come back from the break with the
winner of that. Regardless, guys, welcome to the

1356
01:32:04,865 --> 01:32:06,603
beginning of the new campaign.

1357
01:32:06,603 --> 01:32:08,081
(yelling)

1358
01:32:08,081 --> 01:32:09,582
MATT: We'll see you here in a few minutes.

1359
01:32:09,582 --> 01:32:10,442
LIAM: Magic!

1360
01:32:10,442 --> 01:32:11,302
LAURA: Magic!

1361
01:32:11,302 --> 01:49:06,701
[break]

1362
01:49:06,701 --> 01:49:10,388
MATT: Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. Guys!
Wow!

1363
01:49:10,388 --> 01:49:13,570
LIAM: Grenade lobbed in by Foster at the last
second.

1364
01:49:13,570 --> 01:49:18,793
MATT: I know. Welcome back. So, first and
foremost, we have our winner of the white oak

1365
01:49:18,793 --> 01:49:27,433
complete dice tower from our friends at Wyrmwood.
The winner is GTDevoto. Congratulations. Denova

1366
01:49:27,433 --> 01:49:29,801
will reach out to you and get your contact
information. Everyone else, thank you for

1367
01:49:29,801 --> 01:49:33,298
entering. We'll have more with each future episode
of Critical Role, thanks to our friends at

1368
01:49:33,298 --> 01:49:37,059
Wyrmwood Gaming. Also, as a heads-up for those who
aren't familiar and for those who may be, we have

1369
01:49:37,059 --> 01:49:45,555
a Tuesday aftershow of this called Talks Machina
where our friend W. Brian Foster Esq., just mixing

1370
01:49:45,555 --> 01:49:51,438
up all of his names-- you guys know him, Brian W.
Foster, friend of the show, is the host of the

1371
01:49:51,438 --> 01:49:56,699
show, and he'll be there Tuesday talking about
this episode tonight with some of the cast. 7PM

1372
01:49:56,699 --> 01:50:00,476
Pacific time on Tuesday. So. Anyway.

1373
01:50:00,476 --> 01:50:07,175
(laughter)

1374
01:50:07,175 --> 01:50:08,658
MATT: Bringing us back.

1375
01:50:08,658 --> 01:50:10,238
TRAVIS: Bring that ass back.

1376
01:50:10,238 --> 01:50:14,875
SAM: Five dragons swoop down.

1377
01:50:14,875 --> 01:50:16,842
(laughter)

1378
01:50:16,842 --> 01:50:25,575
MATT: It's so hackneyed. As you guys begin to
approach the outside of this large, dark navy

1379
01:50:25,575 --> 01:50:31,435
tent, people are being inspected and ushered
through by the well-groomed half-orc on one side,

1380
01:50:31,435 --> 01:50:37,624
and the pale woman, Yasha, you met for a second
time approaching the outskirts of this carnival,

1381
01:50:37,624 --> 01:50:43,844
with entry fees being collected by both as people
begin to pass into this large structure. A few

1382
01:50:43,844 --> 01:50:49,642
feet off to the side, you see a small crowd
gathered around Mollymauk, who is sitting atop a

1383
01:50:49,642 --> 01:50:55,109
small blanket and has cards splayed before him, a
similar set that you saw Jester toying with

1384
01:50:55,109 --> 01:51:02,634
earlier, and a farmer sits across from him,
listening intently. "All right, so what can you

1385
01:51:02,634 --> 01:51:04,734
"tell me about this here cough?"

1386
01:51:04,734 --> 01:51:10,082
TALIESIN: How long have you had it?

1387
01:51:10,082 --> 01:51:14,584
MATT: "Oh, going on like three, four months."
(coughs)

1388
01:51:14,584 --> 01:51:21,187
TALIESIN: It looks like it's getting better. Oh
yes. Does it feel like it's getting better?

1389
01:51:21,187 --> 01:51:24,112
MATT: "Oh, right now? Yeah."

1390
01:51:24,112 --> 01:51:33,564
TALIESIN: Yeah, look at that. I would maybe
breathe a tincture or something. Let's-- yeah,

1391
01:51:33,564 --> 01:51:35,506
maybe you should get that looked at.

1392
01:51:35,506 --> 01:51:38,991
MATT: "From who? What do the cards tell me?"

1393
01:51:38,991 --> 01:51:44,465
TALIESIN: Some sort of physician, perhaps.

1394
01:51:44,465 --> 01:51:52,051
MATT: "Right! Of course! Oh, thank you so much."
And he places a--

1395
01:51:52,051 --> 01:51:54,441
TALIESIN: Platinum Dragon be with you. Thank you.

1396
01:51:54,441 --> 01:51:58,125
MATT: Stands up. "Dear, a physician!" And he walks
off.

1397
01:51:58,125 --> 01:52:01,174
(laughter)

1398
01:52:01,174 --> 01:52:04,532
MARISHA: What happened to 'no sick people'?

1399
01:52:04,532 --> 01:52:07,021
TALIESIN: This is outside the tent.

1400
01:52:07,021 --> 01:52:10,864
MATT: Yeah, he doesn't enter the tent. He goes off
to the side.

1401
01:52:10,864 --> 01:52:12,945
MARISHA: Fair.

1402
01:52:12,945 --> 01:52:16,600
TALIESIN: It's good to see you all here, though.

1403
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:25,504
LAURA: Here's the thing. Some of us have weapons
that we don't want to pass away to other people,

1404
01:52:25,504 --> 01:52:31,389
so how much of a chance is it that we could get
through without having to do that, you know?

1405
01:52:31,389 --> 01:52:36,491
ASHLEY: Well, you can't see the show if you have a
weapon on you.

1406
01:52:36,491 --> 01:52:44,313
LAURA: Right. And we really want to see the show.
But, you know, we are really good at security,

1407
01:52:44,313 --> 01:52:51,242
like all of us are really strong, and we could
fight things that came up, too, so maybe it would

1408
01:52:51,242 --> 01:52:53,740
be best if you don't take our weapons, and then we
could help.

1409
01:52:53,740 --> 01:53:02,040
MARISHA: Actually, here's a deal. We'll make you a
good deal. You waive our entry fee and if anyone

1410
01:53:02,040 --> 01:53:07,411
needs to be kicked out, or any security needs to
happen, we'll help you out.

1411
01:53:07,411 --> 01:53:09,527
SAM: Like deputy bouncers?

1412
01:53:09,527 --> 01:53:11,415
MARISHA: Like deputy bouncers.

1413
01:53:11,415 --> 01:53:15,378
ASHLEY: Well, see, funny thing about that, though,
is that's my job. So.

1414
01:53:15,378 --> 01:53:17,206
LAURA: So do you want to hire us?

1415
01:53:17,206 --> 01:53:18,385
ASHLEY: No.

1416
01:53:18,385 --> 01:53:23,666
MARISHA: You would be like our boss. Have you ever
wanted to be a boss? Like, in charge?

1417
01:53:23,666 --> 01:53:25,350
ASHLEY: Well, I am.

1418
01:53:25,350 --> 01:53:27,829
LAURA: We could ask you for days off sometimes.

1419
01:53:27,829 --> 01:53:34,814
MATT: A heavy greenish-grey-skinned mitt slaps
onto Beau's shoulder, as you glance over to see

1420
01:53:34,814 --> 01:53:43,952
the large, well-groomed half-orc man standing
there. "I'm terribly sorry, but we've got it taken

1421
01:53:43,952 --> 01:53:48,739
"care of. If you wish to pay entry, you can, but
the rules are the rules. So sorry."

1422
01:53:48,739 --> 01:53:52,433
LIAM: Do they get stored in some sort of locker or
something?

1423
01:53:52,433 --> 01:53:57,190
ASHLEY: I hold them. And if you want, I can stand
right next to you guys. You can keep your eye on

1424
01:53:57,190 --> 01:53:58,958
me the whole time.

1425
01:53:58,958 --> 01:54:00,494
TALIESIN: She's very trustworthy.

1426
01:54:00,494 --> 01:54:02,422
LIAM: That seems fair-ish to me.

1427
01:54:02,422 --> 01:54:05,462
MATT: "Yasha, does that seem-- all right."

1428
01:54:05,462 --> 01:54:12,770
MARISHA: I look at him as I take his hand off.
What's your name, by the by?

1429
01:54:12,770 --> 01:54:14,590
MATT: "Bo."

1430
01:54:14,590 --> 01:54:18,181
MARISHA: Good name.

1431
01:54:18,181 --> 01:54:20,528
MATT: "Thank you."

1432
01:54:20,528 --> 01:54:22,868
LIAM: Well, that's funny, because your name is
also Beau.

1433
01:54:22,868 --> 01:54:25,027
MATT: "Really?"

1434
01:54:25,027 --> 01:54:31,237
MARISHA: You didn't have to-- maybe let me choose
when to tell people--

1435
01:54:31,237 --> 01:54:33,624
MATT: "No, no, I'm curious about this. How do you
spell your name?"

1436
01:54:33,624 --> 01:54:38,321
MARISHA: Well, it's short for Beauregard.

1437
01:54:38,321 --> 01:54:40,097
MATT: "Oh, mine's just B-O."

1438
01:54:40,097 --> 01:54:46,357
MARISHA: That's unfortunate. I mean, it's great.
Did kids make fun-- never mind.

1439
01:54:46,357 --> 01:54:50,317
MATT: "It's not inaccurate." And he flicks the
side of his mustache.

1440
01:54:50,317 --> 01:54:53,381
(laughter)

1441
01:54:53,381 --> 01:54:58,804
LAURA: Like, is his mustache especially B.O.-y?
Like, what? That's really gross.

1442
01:54:58,804 --> 01:55:00,180
MATT: Make a perception check.

1443
01:55:00,180 --> 01:55:05,879
LAURA: Ew. I don't want to perceive this. I'm glad
I didn't roll very well.

1444
01:55:05,879 --> 01:55:08,639
MARISHA: Can I make an insight check? Is he a
creep or is he just--

1445
01:55:08,639 --> 01:55:13,559
MATT: Make an insight check. Eight? Thankfully,
you're not in proximity enough to catch a whiff of

1446
01:55:13,559 --> 01:55:14,901
his mustache.

1447
01:55:14,901 --> 01:55:17,305
MARISHA: Natural 20.

1448
01:55:17,305 --> 01:55:25,212
MATT: Okay. Interestingly enough, he seems very
well put-together. And he seems like he's just

1449
01:55:25,212 --> 01:55:30,717
fucking with you. He's having fun, and he's
messing with you, and he's just casual and

1450
01:55:30,717 --> 01:55:37,841
competent and actually pretty well-groomed. He
doesn't smell. And he seems more just enjoying the

1451
01:55:37,841 --> 01:55:39,360
discourse.

1452
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:45,601
MARISHA: It's funny, see, my name's Beau because
my parents wanted a son.

1453
01:55:45,601 --> 01:55:56,111
MATT: "Well. If it helps with any other confusion,
call me the Breaker. Well, if you see the rest of

1454
01:55:56,111 --> 01:55:58,304
"the show, perhaps you'll see why I got my name."

1455
01:55:58,304 --> 01:55:59,892
LAURA: Are you in the show, too?

1456
01:55:59,892 --> 01:56:02,071
MATT: And he cracks his arms. "I am. Towards the
end."

1457
01:56:02,071 --> 01:56:04,490
TRAVIS: Now I want to see the show.

1458
01:56:04,490 --> 01:56:09,933
MATT: "Well then. May I?" You can see now the
crowd's starting to queue up behind you pretty

1459
01:56:09,933 --> 01:56:14,796
heavily. "Besides, if you're going to enter, we've
got to get through the rest of this riff-raff. Do

1460
01:56:14,796 --> 01:56:16,742
"you wish to join in?"

1461
01:56:16,742 --> 01:56:21,876
LIAM: I pull-- all I have is a dagger, but I just
hand it to Yasha.

1462
01:56:21,876 --> 01:56:23,347
LAURA: Just one dagger?

1463
01:56:23,347 --> 01:56:25,735
ASHLEY: I promise you I will give it back.

1464
01:56:25,735 --> 01:56:27,523
LIAM: Yes, here you go.

1465
01:56:27,523 --> 01:56:29,690
ASHLEY: I promise you I will give you all of your
weapons back.

1466
01:56:29,690 --> 01:56:32,138
LAURA: Pinky-swear me, Yasha.

1467
01:56:32,138 --> 01:56:34,393
ASHLEY: Ugh. I don't like--

1468
01:56:34,393 --> 01:56:38,249
LAURA: Yeah! Now we're best friends. Here's my
sickle.

1469
01:56:38,249 --> 01:56:46,741
MARISHA: I have a staff, but I also use it as a
walking stick, so I like to keep it on me.

1470
01:56:46,741 --> 01:56:49,359
TALIESIN: Can you not walk around without it or
something?

1471
01:56:49,359 --> 01:56:50,714
LAURA: She has a really bad limp.

1472
01:56:50,714 --> 01:56:55,057
MARISHA: Sometimes I get a little twinge, a little
disc issue.

1473
01:56:55,057 --> 01:56:58,609
TALIESIN: Can you hand me your staff so I can
watch this? I want to see this limp of yours.

1474
01:56:58,609 --> 01:57:00,773
Purely for my own entertainment.

1475
01:57:00,773 --> 01:57:04,347
MARISHA: Are you patronizing me, Mollymauk?

1476
01:57:04,347 --> 01:57:06,762
TALIESIN: No, I'm hoping that you're going to
patronize us.

1477
01:57:06,762 --> 01:57:09,290
(laughter)

1478
01:57:09,290 --> 01:57:12,596
MARISHA: Can I keep my stick?

1479
01:57:12,596 --> 01:57:15,443
(laughter)

1480
01:57:15,443 --> 01:57:20,007
ASHLEY: How about this? I'll take it, and I can
just carry you to your seat.

1481
01:57:20,007 --> 01:57:22,271
MARISHA: Deal.

1482
01:57:22,271 --> 01:57:26,251
LAURA: How are you carrying all of these weapons?

1483
01:57:26,251 --> 01:57:28,764
ASHLEY: Because I'm really fucking strong.

1484
01:57:28,764 --> 01:57:31,775
(laughter)

1485
01:57:31,775 --> 01:57:37,057
ASHLEY: You. Can I give him a pat-down, because
you're--

1486
01:57:37,057 --> 01:57:43,282
MATT: Sure, roll an investigation check. I'll give
you advantage because you're really good at this.

1487
01:57:43,282 --> 01:57:45,692
LIAM: I open up the coat just so she can see the
books.

1488
01:57:45,692 --> 01:57:57,277
ASHLEY: I don't think I find anything. 12.

1489
01:57:57,277 --> 01:58:02,654
MATT: You find two books and a modicum of change
and nothing else on him. He's actually pretty

1490
01:58:02,654 --> 01:58:07,147
sparse as far as collectibles and keepsakes.

1491
01:58:07,147 --> 01:58:12,124
ASHLEY: I just thought your chest looked rather
square, so I wanted to see what was happening.

1492
01:58:12,124 --> 01:58:16,368
LIAM: I'm practically concave. Is it concave or
convex, I forget?

1493
01:58:16,368 --> 01:58:17,752
ALL: Concave.

1494
01:58:17,752 --> 01:58:19,120
MARISHA: Convex would be funny.

1495
01:58:19,120 --> 01:58:25,886
(laughter)

1496
01:58:25,886 --> 01:58:30,715
SAM: I'll hand her my shortsword, but not my
little crossbow.

1497
01:58:30,715 --> 01:58:33,619
MATT: Okay, make a sleight-of-hand check to try
and hide that.

1498
01:58:33,619 --> 01:58:39,603
SAM: Four. Oh, wait. 12.

1499
01:58:39,603 --> 01:58:42,871
MATT: You have advantage on that, technically,
right? Dexterity checks?

1500
01:58:42,871 --> 01:58:45,399
SAM: Well, did you give me dexterity or just
stealth? How does that work?

1501
01:58:45,399 --> 01:58:48,062
LAURA: I think it's just stealth checks with the
blessing.

1502
01:58:48,062 --> 01:58:50,005
MATT: Let me double-check that real fast.

1503
01:58:50,005 --> 01:58:53,139
ALL: Going to the book.

1504
01:58:53,139 --> 01:58:54,887
MATT: What the heck!

1505
01:58:54,887 --> 01:58:58,265
SAM: We're playing First Edition, right?

1506
01:58:58,265 --> 01:59:00,521
MATT: No, it is stealth. You're correct. Yeah.

1507
01:59:00,521 --> 01:59:04,523
LAURA: Sorry, I wish I wouldn't have said it and
then you could have had advantage just then, but

1508
01:59:04,523 --> 01:59:06,198
I'm not a cheater.

1509
01:59:06,198 --> 01:59:07,531
SAM: No, you're not.

1510
01:59:07,531 --> 01:59:09,143
LIAM: Out of game.

1511
01:59:09,143 --> 01:59:11,675
MATT: You see him slowly pocketing this crossbow.

1512
01:59:11,675 --> 01:59:16,376
ASHLEY: No, no, no. Little girl.

1513
01:59:16,376 --> 01:59:17,791
SAM: I'm just a little girl.

1514
01:59:17,791 --> 01:59:18,987
ASHLEY: Give me your other weapon.

1515
01:59:18,987 --> 01:59:25,698
SAM: This is a toy for little children. All right,
here. I'm sorry.

1516
01:59:25,698 --> 01:59:29,675
LAURA: Are you keeping track of what goes with
what person? Because it's a lot.

1517
01:59:29,675 --> 01:59:30,907
TALIESIN: She's very good at this.

1518
01:59:30,907 --> 01:59:32,107
ASHLEY: I'm very good.

1519
01:59:32,107 --> 01:59:37,886
LIAM: I just drag Nott five feet over. That is two
strikes against you. I think we should really just

1520
01:59:37,886 --> 01:59:40,138
sort of enjoy the show tonight.

1521
01:59:40,138 --> 01:59:42,356
SAM: All right. But what if someone attacks us?

1522
01:59:42,356 --> 01:59:45,526
LIAM: Well, I'll handle that for you, okay?

1523
01:59:45,526 --> 01:59:46,768
SAM: All right.

1524
01:59:46,768 --> 01:59:49,076
MARISHA: Also, little girls don't tend to tell
people they're little girls.

1525
01:59:49,076 --> 01:59:50,827
SAM: This is my first time.

1526
01:59:50,827 --> 01:59:52,983
(laughter)

1527
01:59:52,983 --> 02:00:00,472
LIAM: When someone is a goblin in the middle of a
town where people hate goblins--

1528
02:00:00,472 --> 02:00:03,839
LAURA: Stop saying the word 'goblin'. People are
going to hear you.

1529
02:00:03,839 --> 02:00:07,005
SAM: I mean, she's kind of right.

1530
02:00:07,059 --> 02:00:08,819
(laughter)

1531
02:00:08,819 --> 02:00:13,206
LIAM: Technically, I dragged her away, but you
know, D&D is funny with what is known and not.

1532
02:00:13,206 --> 02:00:14,923
TALIESIN: I heard you over the earring.

1533
02:00:14,923 --> 02:00:16,416
ALL: Aww.

1534
02:00:16,416 --> 02:00:18,056
LIAM: RIP.

1535
02:00:18,056 --> 02:00:20,200
ASHLEY: Wait, I didn't get your weapon.

1536
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:21,938
TRAVIS: Hah.

1537
02:00:21,938 --> 02:00:30,206
ASHLEY: Do you want to stare at me all day, or do
you want to give me the weapon so you can go watch

1538
02:00:30,206 --> 02:00:31,582
the show?

1539
02:00:31,582 --> 02:00:33,161
TRAVIS: That's an interesting choice.

1540
02:00:33,161 --> 02:00:34,918
ASHLEY: It's not really a choice.

1541
02:00:34,918 --> 02:00:37,906
TRAVIS: Sure.

1542
02:00:37,906 --> 02:00:40,621
MATT: What do you pull out?

1543
02:00:40,621 --> 02:00:41,950
TRAVIS: My falchion.

1544
02:00:41,950 --> 02:00:42,928
SAM: Your what?

1545
02:00:42,928 --> 02:00:48,510
MATT: A falchion, a large, curved sword, emerges
from a sheath on his back.

1546
02:00:48,510 --> 02:00:49,772
SAM: What is that?

1547
02:00:49,772 --> 02:00:51,484
ALL: It's a large, curved sword.

1548
02:00:51,484 --> 02:00:54,040
(laughter)

1549
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:57,824
ASHLEY: I twist it around a little. Play with it.
This is nice.

1550
02:00:57,824 --> 02:01:00,151
TALIESIN: Very nice.

1551
02:01:00,151 --> 02:01:01,625
ASHLEY: I like it.

1552
02:01:01,625 --> 02:01:04,673
SAM: It's a falchion!

1553
02:01:04,673 --> 02:01:07,512
LAURA: You're going to hang out with us the whole
night?

1554
02:01:07,512 --> 02:01:09,307
ASHLEY: I'll hang out beside you so you can
watch.

1555
02:01:09,307 --> 02:01:12,497
MATT: Make a perception check.

1556
02:01:12,497 --> 02:01:15,983
TRAVIS: 11.

1557
02:01:15,983 --> 02:01:21,319
MATT: 11, that's enough. As she spins the falchion
around, you notice that, affixed to her back, in

1558
02:01:21,319 --> 02:01:28,954
uncharacteristically clean leather towards the
rest of her outfit, what appears to be a

1559
02:01:28,954 --> 02:01:36,464
slung-over sheath and a very large bladed weapon,
larger than your falchion, affixed to her back.

1560
02:01:36,464 --> 02:01:39,489
MARISHA: I just like how everyone says
'falchion'.

1561
02:01:39,489 --> 02:01:42,947
LIAM: It's pronounced 'felching'.

1562
02:01:42,947 --> 02:01:44,996
(laughter)

1563
02:01:44,996 --> 02:01:49,388
TALIESIN: I'm going to pick up my cards in a very
specific order very quickly and start stacking the deck.

1564
02:01:49,388 --> 02:01:56,079
ASHLEY: All right, well. If you want to follow me,
I'll take you to your seats and I'll stand beside

1565
02:01:56,079 --> 02:01:57,374
you the whole time.

1566
02:01:57,374 --> 02:01:59,199
TRAVIS: Fucking lead the way.

1567
02:01:59,199 --> 02:02:05,504
TALIESIN: Hey, Jester. Before you go. Tiefling to
tiefling, and thank you for keeping this rabble in check.

1568
02:02:05,504 --> 02:02:07,625
LAURA: Of course, you know, they're a lot to
handle.

1569
02:02:07,625 --> 02:02:11,713
TALIESIN: One on the house. And I pull two cards.

1570
02:02:11,713 --> 02:02:14,868
LAURA: Yes? What are you telling me?

1571
02:02:14,868 --> 02:02:23,191
TALIESIN: I pull the Moon and I pull the Shadow.
Does this mean anything to you?

1572
02:02:23,191 --> 02:02:25,910
LAURA: Oh, yes.

1573
02:02:25,910 --> 02:02:28,120
TALIESIN: Well, think about it. Put it away.

1574
02:02:28,120 --> 02:02:32,911
ASHLEY: Beau.

1575
02:02:32,911 --> 02:02:35,653
MATT: Both her and the half-orc turn to you.

1576
02:02:35,653 --> 02:02:45,547
ASHLEY: Little one. I just go over and I
fireman-style over my shoulder. Since you can't walk.

1577
02:02:45,547 --> 02:02:47,818
MARISHA: Oh.

1578
02:02:47,818 --> 02:02:50,223
(laughter)

1579
02:02:50,223 --> 02:02:51,882
MATT: Just carries her right in. Perfect.

1580
02:02:51,882 --> 02:02:55,653
MARISHA: I turn back to the rest of them.

1581
02:02:55,653 --> 02:02:58,907
TALIESIN: Such grace! Such form! Such dignity!

1582
02:02:58,907 --> 02:03:01,500
TRAVIS: The birds are out already.

1583
02:03:01,500 --> 02:03:07,573
MATT: At which point, the other Bo, Bo the
Breaker, goes ahead and collects five copper from

1584
02:03:07,573 --> 02:03:12,416
each of you as you pass through, so mark off five
copper, except for the two of you, you guys are

1585
02:03:12,416 --> 02:03:13,965
part of it.

1586
02:03:13,965 --> 02:03:19,500
LAURA: If I skip around, will I be part of the
show and then I don't have to pay?

1587
02:03:19,500 --> 02:03:25,103
TALIESIN: Weirdly, being part of the show means
you strangely pay more. I'm not entirely sure how

1588
02:03:25,103 --> 02:03:26,655
that works.

1589
02:03:26,655 --> 02:03:28,333
LIAM: Nott, do you have five copper?

1590
02:03:28,333 --> 02:03:30,728
SAM: For you, Caleb, I do.

1591
02:03:30,728 --> 02:03:33,525
LIAM: No, I'm not asking. I was going to help you,
but if you have it, you're good.

1592
02:03:33,525 --> 02:03:36,352
SAM: No, you've been spotting me all day, I'll
take care of both of us.

1593
02:03:36,352 --> 02:03:41,074
ASHLEY: Mollymauk. That Jester's adorable.

1594
02:03:41,074 --> 02:03:43,190
TALIESIN: I know. Highly entertained.

1595
02:03:43,190 --> 02:03:44,614
ASHLEY: I like her.

1596
02:03:44,614 --> 02:03:46,122
TALIESIN: I do too.

1597
02:03:46,122 --> 02:03:55,309
MATT: So, stepping into the interior of the tent,
the rocky floor filled with grass and dirt and

1598
02:03:55,309 --> 02:04:02,584
various flattened groundscape on the outskirts of
the Ustaloch, you can see a thick, heavy

1599
02:04:02,584 --> 02:04:11,770
tarp-like material hitting the very edge where the
heavy dark blue cloth hangs from the sides of the

1600
02:04:11,770 --> 02:04:17,686
tent you're within. You can see where the seating is
guided across the floor, and there, already in a

1601
02:04:17,686 --> 02:04:23,342
very packed room, you see a few dozen townsfolk
that have begun to gather in a semicircle. There

1602
02:04:23,342 --> 02:04:27,248
is the entrance flap of the tent where you guys
are walking in. As soon as you walk in, you can

1603
02:04:27,248 --> 02:04:34,678
see a central pillar, a heavy column of wood, a
tree that has been completely rounded off on all

1604
02:04:34,678 --> 02:04:40,999
sides, held aloft to carry the top of the canopy
of the tent itself. And across the way, you can

1605
02:04:40,999 --> 02:04:44,481
see a larger flap tent that is currently closed
that appears to be probably the performers'

1606
02:04:44,481 --> 02:04:51,764
entrance. You can see above you four hanging
lanterns that glow with what seems like a flicker

1607
02:04:51,764 --> 02:04:59,384
of light, but the pattern to them is consistent,
meaning it's not probably natural flame. Children

1608
02:04:59,384 --> 02:05:05,187
and people are beginning to mash around the sides,
and the space along the edges of the interior of

1609
02:05:05,187 --> 02:05:08,558
this tent is starting to get a little cramped.
Where do you guide them, Yasha?

1610
02:05:08,558 --> 02:05:11,148
ASHLEY: Did you guys want to sit in the front
row?

1611
02:05:11,148 --> 02:05:14,266
SAM: That's what we were told is the best seat in
the house.

1612
02:05:14,266 --> 02:05:16,048
ASHLEY: We want to sit in the front row.

1613
02:05:16,048 --> 02:05:22,094
MATT: So there's-- if you consider a semicircle
pattern here, there's-- if you're entering, you

1614
02:05:22,094 --> 02:05:26,319
can go front to the right, front to the left,
front to the center, anywhere in between. Where

1615
02:05:26,319 --> 02:05:28,407
would you like to be currently sitting?

1616
02:05:28,407 --> 02:05:30,653
ASHLEY: Front and center? Or do you want to be on
the sides?

1617
02:05:30,653 --> 02:05:31,916
LAURA: Front and center!

1618
02:05:31,916 --> 02:05:33,657
ASHLEY: I take them to the front and center.

1619
02:05:33,657 --> 02:05:35,398
MATT: Front and center, okay.

1620
02:05:35,398 --> 02:05:38,825
LIAM: I'm going to keep my hand on my meager purse
for the evening.

1621
02:05:38,825 --> 02:05:40,133
MATT: Okay.

1622
02:05:40,133 --> 02:05:44,868
LAURA: As soon as I sit down, I'm going to pull
out my sketchbook and draw the moon and the shadow

1623
02:05:44,868 --> 02:05:47,406
card that Molly showed me.

1624
02:05:47,406 --> 02:05:58,507
MARISHA: As we're walking over, I say, hey, Yasha,
'cause I was totally on your shoulder, heard you

1625
02:05:58,507 --> 02:06:01,347
talking about my friend, Jester.

1626
02:06:01,347 --> 02:06:02,727
ASHLEY: Ah, shit.

1627
02:06:02,727 --> 02:06:04,069
MARISHA: Yeah.

1628
02:06:04,069 --> 02:06:07,245
ASHLEY: I didn't mean anything by it. I just--

1629
02:06:07,245 --> 02:06:12,452
MARISHA: No, dude. No, she's never mentioned a
significant other, so, I mean.

1630
02:06:12,452 --> 02:06:17,693
ASHLEY: Oh, I'm not looking for anything, I
just--

1631
02:06:17,693 --> 02:06:19,717
MARISHA: Will you hold me through the show?

1632
02:06:19,717 --> 02:06:23,883
(laughter)

1633
02:06:23,883 --> 02:06:29,090
MARISHA: Like, cradle me?

1634
02:06:29,090 --> 02:06:32,138
ASHLEY: That's an extra charge. We do do that,
though.

1635
02:06:32,138 --> 02:06:34,917
MARISHA: How much?

1636
02:06:34,917 --> 02:06:40,648
ASHLEY: Well, it's an extra five gold pieces.

1637
02:06:40,648 --> 02:06:43,139
MARISHA: Five gold?

1638
02:06:43,139 --> 02:06:46,125
ASHLEY: These arms are worth a lot.

1639
02:06:46,125 --> 02:06:50,628
TALIESIN: It's a very swaddling hug. You've never
experienced anything like it.

1640
02:06:50,628 --> 02:06:59,040
ASHLEY: It's the best way to see the show, if
that's how you want it.

1641
02:06:59,040 --> 02:07:09,214
MARISHA: I'll give you five silver just to have
your shrug to sit on so my butt's not on the floor.

1642
02:07:09,214 --> 02:07:13,782
ASHLEY: I don't take off my shrug.

1643
02:07:13,782 --> 02:07:15,995
MARISHA: Oh, sorry.

1644
02:07:15,995 --> 02:07:22,600
ASHLEY: How about you just keep your money and
I'll put you in a chair and I'll just watch over

1645
02:07:22,600 --> 02:07:24,133
your weapons.

1646
02:07:24,133 --> 02:07:25,446
MARISHA: Okay.

1647
02:07:25,446 --> 02:07:30,222
MATT: So she places you on the ground, as there
are no chairs.

1648
02:07:30,222 --> 02:07:33,710
ASHLEY: On the ground, I mean, because there's no
chairs.

1649
02:07:33,710 --> 02:07:40,817
LAURA: Oh, there's no chairs? Aw. I was picturing
benches. That's okay.

1650
02:07:40,817 --> 02:07:42,612
TRAVIS: There's no benches? Oh, fuck.

1651
02:07:42,612 --> 02:07:44,783
MATT: Where are they going to transport benches
from place to place?

1652
02:07:44,783 --> 02:07:46,225
ASHLEY: That's a good point.

1653
02:07:46,225 --> 02:07:49,841
TRAVIS: Carnival? I don't know.

1654
02:07:49,841 --> 02:07:52,971
(laughter)

1655
02:07:52,971 --> 02:07:55,366
MATT: Well, sorry, you have Fletching and Moondrop
to deal with.

1656
02:07:55,366 --> 02:07:57,513
TALIESIN: Bring a cushion from home like a regular
person.

1657
02:07:57,513 --> 02:08:02,589
MATT: So, as the music has died down and everyone
begins to crowd in and whisper to themselves,

1658
02:08:02,589 --> 02:08:09,914
eventually it begins to quiet a bit, everyone
having their seats. The familiar sound of the

1659
02:08:09,914 --> 02:08:18,700
fiddle begins to play, and everyone quickly gets
quiet, down to a hush. The music seems sourceless

1660
02:08:18,700 --> 02:08:26,102
in the interior of the tent. Everyone begins to
look around to see where it may come from. You

1661
02:08:26,102 --> 02:08:30,692
hear points of hushed "look"s, pointing off in
different areas, and at the top of the tent, you

1662
02:08:30,692 --> 02:08:39,033
see, seeming to stretch and fall, like a slow drop
of water, the man in red you saw earlier descends

1663
02:08:39,033 --> 02:08:44,939
from the top of the tent, but now dressed
head-to-toe in a matching deep blue outfit and

1664
02:08:44,939 --> 02:08:55,818
full makeup, to where he appears out of the canopy
of the tent. He hangs from a rope by one foot,

1665
02:08:55,818 --> 02:09:03,069
it's wrapped around and clutched as his foot
catches the edge. Playing his violin

1666
02:09:03,069 --> 02:09:10,601
ever-so-slowly as he carefully descends, and then
at the last moment releases the rope and lands on

1667
02:09:10,639 --> 02:09:19,721
his feet, continuing the music he's playing. He
slowly spins as the longer-haired elf leader of

1668
02:09:19,721 --> 02:09:24,690
the earlier parade that you saw, the one that had
marked back briefly to your two new friends over

1669
02:09:24,690 --> 02:09:29,719
here, enters the tent from the distant flaps, the
performers' entrance, his head now sporting that

1670
02:09:29,719 --> 02:09:35,963
same tall hat, flopping backwards at the apex. He
extends his arms, removing the hat, and takes a

1671
02:09:35,963 --> 02:09:38,346
deep bow as the crowd begins to clap.

1672
02:09:38,346 --> 02:09:42,905
(applause)

1673
02:09:42,905 --> 02:09:52,199
MATT: "Ladies and gentlemen of Trostenwald, I am
Carnival Master Gustav Fletching, and allow me to

1674
02:09:52,199 --> 02:09:59,005
"welcome you to the Fletching and Moondrop's
Traveling Carnival of Curiosities."

1675
02:09:59,005 --> 02:10:01,757
(applause)

1676
02:10:01,757 --> 02:10:08,061
MATT: "I ask you, each and every one of you--" You
hear some children giggle as he makes eye contact.

1677
02:10:08,061 --> 02:10:17,591
"--grant us your imaginations this eve but a
trifle bit of time, and allow us to reveal a realm

1678
02:10:17,591 --> 02:10:28,993
"of laughter, mystery, danger, and beauty. I see
you've already met Desmond." And he gestures

1679
02:10:28,993 --> 02:10:35,716
towards the man in all blue who's playing the
fiddle. "He'll be part of our story tonight, so

1680
02:10:35,716 --> 02:10:46,827
"keep a wily eye for the shifting fool. But first,
I tell you a tale of two sisters of the Fey." And

1681
02:10:46,827 --> 02:10:53,983
as Desmond slowly leaves the tent, you see two
armored guards by where he is now have entered,

1682
02:10:53,983 --> 02:11:01,111
two of the Crown's Guard are stepping by the
entrance where he walked in, watch him pass. "Lost

1683
02:11:01,111 --> 02:11:10,620
"without form into the mazes of the underworld.
There, where the body would break, they found a

1684
02:11:10,620 --> 02:11:22,449
"teacher in a mystical serpent, and the gift they
received was the ability to bend with this maze

1685
02:11:22,449 --> 02:11:31,321
"that captured them and slither their way back to
the surface to reclaim their place in the world.

1686
02:11:31,321 --> 02:11:42,175
"May I present to you Mona and Yuli, the Knot
Sisters." As he slowly backs through the

1687
02:11:42,175 --> 02:11:49,178
performers' entrance, the two halfling dancers you
saw earlier, in the full bodysuits, emerge from

1688
02:11:49,178 --> 02:11:57,244
behind the Carnival Master as he discreetly exits.
They sport serpentine makeup, scales affixed to

1689
02:11:57,244 --> 02:12:06,025
the sides of their face and arms. Approaching the
central spire, the pole that holds the tent up,

1690
02:12:06,025 --> 02:12:12,218
one immediately leaps onto the shoulders of the
other, bending her back a near-impossible amount,

1691
02:12:12,218 --> 02:12:19,096
creating this humanoid sculpture that you see the
front row cringe at the idea of the pain that

1692
02:12:19,096 --> 02:12:24,854
would cause an average individual. But these
halflings are very nimble and able to create

1693
02:12:24,854 --> 02:12:32,602
almost a single form out of two bodies. Their
rigid form becomes fluid to the eye as they move

1694
02:12:32,602 --> 02:12:37,698
and shift to the music, the violin now sourceless
once again, not seeing where this Desmond is

1695
02:12:37,698 --> 02:12:41,795
placed, but they seem to move as it picks up
speed.

1696
02:12:41,795 --> 02:12:43,994
LAURA: (whispers) It's like the serpent we fought,
you guys!

1697
02:12:43,994 --> 02:12:47,291
SAM: I was expecting more Ringling Brothers,
actually.

1698
02:12:47,291 --> 02:12:49,593
(laughter)

1699
02:12:49,593 --> 02:12:54,279
MATT: Suddenly, the top one folds over and slams
into the ground, tumbling across the center in a

1700
02:12:54,279 --> 02:13:00,512
wild display of physical control. The two of them
begin to tangle and wrap like two battling snakes,

1701
02:13:00,512 --> 02:13:08,362
their bodies seemingly disconnecting from the
rigid halfling forms you had seen, and you swear,

1702
02:13:08,362 --> 02:13:16,305
for a moment, becoming serpentine-like as they
intertwine around the base of this pole. It's

1703
02:13:16,305 --> 02:13:20,737
beautiful and violent at the same time. It's
off-putting. And watch as they curl around the

1704
02:13:20,737 --> 02:13:27,645
base of this pole, the lights above begin to
become a dull greenish-blue, and get darker and

1705
02:13:27,645 --> 02:13:34,833
darker, presenting this imagery of the underworld.
One by one, they silently tell a tale of struggle,

1706
02:13:34,833 --> 02:13:43,763
crawling across one, then the other, one at a
time, using their serpentine-like forms as an

1707
02:13:43,763 --> 02:13:49,596
extending ladder, folding over each other as they
use every muscle in their body to cling around

1708
02:13:49,596 --> 02:13:59,019
this pole and ladder-step up like a snake. It's a
very strange but alluring sight, and you can't

1709
02:13:59,019 --> 02:14:04,901
help but notice that you forget that these are two
halfling girls, and you find yourself pulled into

1710
02:14:04,901 --> 02:14:12,841
this wordless story they tell of climbing back to
their place, to the surface, towards the dark sky

1711
02:14:12,841 --> 02:14:18,705
of lightless blue cloth. As the baubles that
contain the interior light of the tent begin to

1712
02:14:18,705 --> 02:14:24,342
glow brighter and brighter, their climbing becomes
more fevered. The two of them, arm into arm, leg

1713
02:14:24,342 --> 02:14:29,516
into leg, rolling up and swirling, until
eventually at the apex they grab each other's arms

1714
02:14:29,516 --> 02:14:36,039
around the pole before spinning downward,
back-to-back, legs outward, with a rapid pace, the

1715
02:14:36,039 --> 02:14:43,804
music coming to a full crescendo. Like a Maypole,
they both curl and twirl and then tumble to the

1716
02:14:43,804 --> 02:14:49,272
ground before the audience with a flourish, arms
in the air, and the audience erupts in applause.

1717
02:14:49,272 --> 02:14:52,232
(applause)

1718
02:14:52,232 --> 02:14:58,616
MATT: As they both begin to back away, smiles on
their faces, nodding to each other, Gustav emerges

1719
02:14:58,616 --> 02:15:05,300
once more from the performers' flap. The fool
appears at the back entrance again, taking an

1720
02:15:05,300 --> 02:15:13,773
ominous tune with his violin this time, his outfit
no longer blue but deepset black. The hanging

1721
02:15:13,773 --> 02:15:24,204
lights darken once again as Gustav takes the
center stage. "In a flash, beyond the ash, the

1722
02:15:24,204 --> 02:15:35,683
"gods all went and gone. The darkness came to
grasp, reclaim, and suffocate the dawn." Suddenly,

1723
02:15:35,683 --> 02:15:43,898
out of the darkness behind him, a burst of flame
lights the room. "But from that night, a burning

1724
02:15:43,898 --> 02:15:53,083
"light doth keep back shadows' bane. The strength
to fight will set alight the morning sun again.

1725
02:15:53,083 --> 02:16:01,174
"Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you Ornna the
fire fairy." And Gustav leaves the tent once more.

1726
02:16:01,174 --> 02:16:09,349
As you watch, a pair of metallic fans, alight with
flame, now frame the beautiful woman of short red

1727
02:16:09,349 --> 02:16:16,639
hair you had seen before in the procession. Gustav
slinks into the darkness and vanishes as Ornna

1728
02:16:16,639 --> 02:16:21,932
spins in hypnotic twirl, her simple dress of golds
and reds almost glowing in the firelight around

1729
02:16:21,932 --> 02:16:26,335
her, the flickering of the flames giving her the
visage of a warrior-goddess battling the dark that

1730
02:16:26,335 --> 02:16:31,101
surrounds. The frenzied fiddle of the fool picks
up as she twirls the fans in her grasp, her face

1731
02:16:31,101 --> 02:16:36,258
stoic and graceful simultaneously. The hushed awe
of the audience fills the air, watching this

1732
02:16:36,258 --> 02:16:41,045
magnificent warrior strike at the shadows, the
lights above flickering brighter with each spin

1733
02:16:41,045 --> 02:16:46,281
and dive, banishing the shadows from the room. She
matches the pace of the music, drawing to a

1734
02:16:46,281 --> 02:16:50,504
crescendo, and leaps, and barrel-turns and
climaxes with her striking a powerful pose as the

1735
02:16:50,504 --> 02:16:55,662
lights rocket to a victorious luminescence. Once
again, the crowd goes crazy.

1736
02:16:55,662 --> 02:16:58,664
(applause)

1737
02:16:58,664 --> 02:17:01,399
LAURA: This is really different than most
carnivals that I've gone to.

1738
02:17:01,399 --> 02:17:03,299
SAM: It's very artistic, yeah.

1739
02:17:03,299 --> 02:17:18,431
MATT: Gustav enters as she exits with a bow, the
fans flickering out. He enters clapping at Ornna. A

1740
02:17:18,431 --> 02:17:27,349
low drumbeat begins to beat in the distance as the
fiddle grows tense once more. "Even as the sun

1741
02:17:27,349 --> 02:17:38,527
"would rise anew, bellowing roars will quake the
lands of Xhorhas and beyond. Terrible beasts, now

1742
02:17:38,527 --> 02:17:51,248
"freed from their dark masters, scattered into our
world." (roars) A terrible, guttural roar shakes

1743
02:17:51,248 --> 02:17:57,470
the room, followed by the sounds of grinding and
dragged chains. From behind the performers' flap,

1744
02:17:57,470 --> 02:18:04,146
the half-orc, Bo, who you'd met earlier, the
Breaker, and the fool, who is now still playing

1745
02:18:04,146 --> 02:18:10,807
the fiddle, yet the bow of it continues to go on
its own as he drags the other chain with his arm,

1746
02:18:10,807 --> 02:18:18,597
wrapped around his forearm. The two of them pull
something through the flap. It swells, and from

1747
02:18:18,597 --> 02:18:26,449
beneath it is revealed an enormous creature of
green scales, slimy-looking skin, and a corpulent

1748
02:18:26,449 --> 02:18:33,891
form, large toad-like legs frame a rotund torso,
and muscular arms that are manacled and pulling

1749
02:18:33,891 --> 02:18:39,847
him in. It fights and wrestles against the taut
chains as it's pulled further and further towards

1750
02:18:39,847 --> 02:18:47,372
the center of the tent, but is held in place by
the two men. It roars a second time. (roars) The

1751
02:18:47,372 --> 02:18:52,080
front row immediately pulling back and screaming.
You hear kids begin to cry. A handful of townsfolk

1752
02:18:52,080 --> 02:18:55,788
shoot to their feet, grasping the children in
fear, preparing to run.

1753
02:18:55,788 --> 02:18:57,902
LAURA: Have we ever seen anything like this
before?

1754
02:18:57,902 --> 02:18:59,130
MARISHA: Yeah, what's it look like?

1755
02:18:59,130 --> 02:19:02,726
LAURA: Well, he just described what it looked
like.

1756
02:19:02,726 --> 02:19:05,126
MARISHA: By name.

1757
02:19:05,126 --> 02:19:12,288
MATT: You have not seen this creature. Gustav
continues, seemingly unflinched by its approach.

1758
02:19:12,288 --> 02:19:20,684
"The devil-toad crawls hungrily--"

1759
02:19:20,684 --> 02:19:23,297
SAM: But what does it look like?

1760
02:19:23,297 --> 02:19:25,089
(laughter)

1761
02:19:25,089 --> 02:19:33,221
MATT: "--into the land of the free folk, lording
over nightmares as they say, and what truth lies

1762
02:19:33,221 --> 02:19:39,730
"behind the eyes of this beast? What would be
learned when the guiding heart of innocence

1763
02:19:39,730 --> 02:19:48,364
"pierces the hateful soul and brings it to see
beauty for the first time? I present to you the

1764
02:19:48,364 --> 02:19:57,317
"vivid voice of Toya." And as Gustav backs away,
the devil-toad struggling against the chains, a

1765
02:19:57,317 --> 02:20:03,317
soft, faint voice begins to slowly emanate from
the air--

1766
02:20:03,317 --> 02:20:05,445
(a voice appears in the background music)

1767
02:20:05,445 --> 02:20:09,675
(exclamations)

1768
02:20:09,675 --> 02:20:17,554
MATT: Eyes previously locked on the frightening
creature now seek a source and find, atop a

1769
02:20:17,554 --> 02:20:27,888
platform within the chamber, high up on a small
platform set against the apex of the pole, a young

1770
02:20:27,888 --> 02:20:37,193
dwarven girl, maybe 12 years of age, her braided
golden hair clasped and her hands at her side, a

1771
02:20:37,193 --> 02:20:46,574
white dress obscuring her feet. She sings with a
mystifying, mature voice that pierces your hearts

1772
02:20:46,574 --> 02:20:56,877
with joy, unexpectedly and uncontrollably. The
crowd audibly gasps as one, the entrancing song of

1773
02:20:56,877 --> 02:21:04,378
this girl bringing every person into this music.
The devil-toad stops struggling against the

1774
02:21:04,378 --> 02:21:11,533
chains, seemingly caught by the sound of her
voice. Its face drops into a soft smile as it

1775
02:21:11,533 --> 02:21:20,571
slowly walks towards the base of the pole and
sits. The half-orc and the fool drop the chains and

1776
02:21:20,571 --> 02:21:28,121
back away, leaving the beast free in its rapture.
Her voice almost begins to summon a chorus from

1777
02:21:28,121 --> 02:21:40,069
the ether, magical in nature, as there are no
others but her joining into this piece. Her smile

1778
02:21:40,069 --> 02:21:46,889
is infectious, and you can't tear your eyes away.
You only now realize the tears down your cheeks,

1779
02:21:46,889 --> 02:21:56,296
but you cannot break your gaze. From the front row
of the audience, on the left, a man stands up, his

1780
02:21:56,296 --> 02:22:03,872
arms outstretched towards her. His dirtied cloak
falls away, his face and skin wracked with age.

1781
02:22:03,872 --> 02:22:14,612
You see his legs shaking as he stands, his cheeks
wet with tears. He shouts (exclaims). His arms

1782
02:22:14,612 --> 02:22:23,457
drop and clutch his chest. Gurgles a burst of vocal pain
once more, and folks nearest to him begin to lean

1783
02:22:23,457 --> 02:22:37,259
away as he begins to shake. You glance over as the
old man yells out once more, as the skin on his

1784
02:22:37,259 --> 02:22:45,940
arms suddenly begins to tear, the bones splitting
from the flesh, writhing, cracking. Dust and blood

1785
02:22:45,940 --> 02:22:50,802
shake from his wounds as his form swells. Screams
begin to ring out from the audience around him,

1786
02:22:50,802 --> 02:22:55,836
people rising up and running for the exit. Chaos
breaks into the room around you. Toya's song

1787
02:22:55,836 --> 02:22:59,991
abruptly ends, the little girl looking down with
fright in her eyes, the devil-toad glancing about

1788
02:22:59,991 --> 02:23:05,175
worriedly, the half-orc and the fool rushing up
beside him to look at the transforming man. The

1789
02:23:05,175 --> 02:23:11,431
half-orc yells, escorting patrons to the exit,
"Everyone! Leave the tent now! Kylre--" As he

1790
02:23:11,431 --> 02:23:16,327
points to the devil-toad. "--get her to safety."
The devil-toad glances up and leaps with a sudden

1791
02:23:16,327 --> 02:23:22,299
gust of strength to the top and grabs the center
pole of the room as it begins to almost quiver to

1792
02:23:22,299 --> 02:23:27,653
his weight. He grabs the little girl safely under
his arm and leaps back down. What are you all doing?

1793
02:23:27,653 --> 02:23:29,248
LAURA: I invoke Duplicity.

1794
02:23:29,248 --> 02:23:36,082
MATT: You watch as her form suddenly dissipates
into multiple seemingly copies of her form as

1795
02:23:36,082 --> 02:23:36,969
Jester.

1796
02:23:36,969 --> 02:23:38,948
TRAVIS: Yasha? We're going to need those weapons
back.

1797
02:23:38,948 --> 02:23:46,169
MARISHA: I turn to Mollymauk and go, man, I
thought it was kind of lame at first, but this is

1798
02:23:46,169 --> 02:23:47,427
awesome!

1799
02:23:47,427 --> 02:23:48,867
TALIESIN: Everyone get out right now.

1800
02:23:48,867 --> 02:23:50,225
MARISHA: This isn't part of the show?

1801
02:23:50,225 --> 02:23:51,407
TRAVIS: Not part of the show.

1802
02:23:51,407 --> 02:23:53,532
SAM: It's too artsy.

1803
02:23:53,532 --> 02:24:02,742
MATT: The old man's body stops quaking, his flesh
now grey and mangled like an ancient tree trunk.

1804
02:24:02,742 --> 02:24:10,081
He turns, his eyes blood-red and bulging, his lips
curled into a horrifying grimace. The two Crown's

1805
02:24:10,081 --> 02:24:13,272
Guard begin to try and make their way through the
panicked crowd, but the people, like a wave of

1806
02:24:13,272 --> 02:24:16,787
chaos, are keeping them at bay. I need everyone to
roll initiative.

1807
02:24:16,787 --> 02:24:19,321
(yelling)

1808
02:24:19,321 --> 02:24:23,861
LIAM: The miniatures come out, guys!

1809
02:24:23,861 --> 02:24:25,904
TRAVIS: First map!

1810
02:24:25,904 --> 02:24:28,715
(yelling)

1811
02:24:28,715 --> 02:24:31,204
MARISHA: I rolled a natural one.

1812
02:24:31,204 --> 02:24:34,124
SAM: That bodes well.

1813
02:24:34,124 --> 02:24:38,288
MATT: So you guys, this guy is actually over here.
You guys are all up here in the front.

1814
02:24:38,288 --> 02:24:46,016
LAURA: Oh yeah, we were right in the fucking front
row. Look at us! We're so cute!

1815
02:24:46,016 --> 02:24:50,506
TALIESIN: Oh my god, it's so pretty.

1816
02:24:50,506 --> 02:24:52,882
SAM: We're all going to die.

1817
02:24:52,882 --> 02:24:56,044
LIAM: Probably. But then the third campaign
begins.

1818
02:24:56,044 --> 02:24:57,908
LAURA: Yay.

1819
02:24:57,908 --> 02:25:03,099
SAM: I like the tents and donkeys outside.
Amazing.

1820
02:25:03,099 --> 02:25:08,368
MARISHA: Look, Taliesin, it's a bardo. Oh my god!

1821
02:25:08,368 --> 02:25:15,997
TALIESIN: No, go for it. Oh boy.

1822
02:25:15,997 --> 02:25:19,917
MATT: All right, so. 20 to 15?

1823
02:25:19,917 --> 02:25:21,514
LAURA: 21.

1824
02:25:21,514 --> 02:25:26,289
MATT: All right.

1825
02:25:26,289 --> 02:25:28,143
LAURA: Oh, wait, 22.

1826
02:25:28,143 --> 02:25:31,523
MATT: Nice. 15 to ten?

1827
02:25:31,523 --> 02:25:33,846
TALIESIN: Ten.

1828
02:25:33,846 --> 02:25:34,518
SAM: Ten.

1829
02:25:34,518 --> 02:25:35,381
TRAVIS: 12.

1830
02:25:35,381 --> 02:25:36,047
ASHLEY: 13.

1831
02:25:36,047 --> 02:25:36,998
LIAM: 11.

1832
02:25:36,998 --> 02:25:51,127
MATT: So 13 and then ten and ten? Sorry, 12. So
Yasha got 13, then we have Fjord. And then 11. And

1833
02:25:51,127 --> 02:25:59,731
then we have Nott at ten. And what'd you get?

1834
02:25:59,731 --> 02:26:03,296
MARISHA: Five. Rolled terribly.

1835
02:26:03,296 --> 02:26:13,685
MATT: There we go. Okay, so. Top of the round, as
this creature turns and glares about in the area,

1836
02:26:13,685 --> 02:26:21,035
this swollen form over here to the side, that's
what remains of the old man who had stood up in

1837
02:26:21,035 --> 02:26:23,899
the center of the chamber. Jester, you're up
first.

1838
02:26:23,899 --> 02:26:30,641
LAURA: Okay. Well, I'm just going to go for it,
all right? I'm going to cast Guiding Bolt on the

1839
02:26:30,641 --> 02:26:33,648
monster that just appeared.

1840
02:26:33,648 --> 02:26:36,944
MATT: Okay, as it turns towards you. It's a saving
throw, correct?

1841
02:26:36,944 --> 02:26:42,162
LAURA: Let's find out. You make a ranged spell
attack.

1842
02:26:42,162 --> 02:26:44,043
MATT: Go ahead and roll on that.

1843
02:26:44,043 --> 02:26:45,278
LAURA: Okay, okay.

1844
02:26:45,278 --> 02:26:47,055
SAM: Magic, you're using magic.

1845
02:26:47,055 --> 02:26:51,061
LAURA: Well, it's cocked. It was 20 and then it
rolled.

1846
02:26:51,061 --> 02:26:53,489
SAM: You said cocked.

1847
02:26:53,489 --> 02:26:54,967
LIAM: You're a cock.

1848
02:26:54,967 --> 02:27:01,317
LAURA: That's 11 plus-- what do I add to my--
Guiding Bolt, plus five. So 16.

1849
02:27:01,317 --> 02:27:02,877
MATT: 16 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

1850
02:27:02,877 --> 02:27:04,629
LAURA: Yay. 4d6.

1851
02:27:04,629 --> 02:27:06,681
MATT: Yasha, you're almost on deck.

1852
02:27:06,681 --> 02:27:19,539
LAURA: Ten, 16, 18, and then any attacks in the
future-- the next attack has advantage.

1853
02:27:19,539 --> 02:27:21,373
MATT: How much damage was that? 2d6, 18?

1854
02:27:21,373 --> 02:27:23,334
SAM: 4d6, you said.

1855
02:27:23,334 --> 02:27:38,826
LAURA: Yeah, it was 4d6 radiant damage. So yeah,
it was 18. And then I'm going to run the opposite

1856
02:27:38,826 --> 02:27:42,894
direction away from him, but I'm going to keep my
duplicate up there.

1857
02:27:42,894 --> 02:27:46,151
MATT: Okay, which, for your duplicate, I should
go ahead and grab something.

1858
02:27:46,151 --> 02:27:52,046
TALIESIN: Oh, you've got toys.

1859
02:27:52,046 --> 02:27:54,273
LAURA: That backpack's almost as big as my dice
bag.

1860
02:27:54,273 --> 02:27:57,075
MATT: Almost. I was like, that's right, you can do
this, so I need to pull out-- we'll say for the

1861
02:27:57,075 --> 02:28:07,862
purposes of this, you're-- we'll put you-- this
will be your duplicate, wherever you want to move

1862
02:28:07,862 --> 02:28:10,530
it from where you are, so she moves there.

1863
02:28:10,530 --> 02:28:18,878
LAURA: So she's going to stay here. I can't reach
that far, but. Oh, shit, sorry.

1864
02:28:18,878 --> 02:28:20,871
MATT: Just let me know where. There?

1865
02:28:20,871 --> 02:28:24,452
LAURA: Sorry, I didn't realize it was--

1866
02:28:24,452 --> 02:28:25,913
MATT: You can get there.

1867
02:28:25,913 --> 02:28:27,141
LAURA: Okay, sounds good.

1868
02:28:27,141 --> 02:28:32,570
MATT: Okay, so that ends your turn. At the top of
your turn, this creature closest to one of the

1869
02:28:32,570 --> 02:28:39,554
people nearby screaming, this young woman who's
trying to back away, it just turns toward her and

1870
02:28:39,554 --> 02:28:48,104
grabs and tries to tear into her with two strikes.
The first one, that is actually going to miss. She

1871
02:28:48,104 --> 02:28:53,653
ducks out of the way and begins crawling across
the ground as it goes for a second attack. That,

1872
02:28:53,653 --> 02:29:01,863
however, does hit, it's a 16. That'll do it. So
with eight points of bludgeoning damage, it

1873
02:29:01,863 --> 02:29:07,177
reaches down and slams its fist into her chest,
and as it does, she gives out this horrible yelp

1874
02:29:07,177 --> 02:29:12,707
as it rips into her and begins gnawing into her
flesh and pulls away with a mouthful of it and

1875
02:29:12,707 --> 02:29:19,634
stands up, its eyes scanning the room for the next
possible victim. It's going to begin to stalk

1876
02:29:19,634 --> 02:29:26,126
forward, coming up to that guy. All right, Yasha,
your turn.

1877
02:29:26,126 --> 02:29:31,790
ASHLEY: Okay. How close am I to them-- I want to
give them their weapons.

1878
02:29:31,790 --> 02:29:35,034
MATT: You're right there. You'd have to-- You're
pretty close to everybody. You could distribute--

1879
02:29:35,034 --> 02:29:39,519
you could use your action to toss the weapons out
to everybody this turn, I'll say.

1880
02:29:39,519 --> 02:29:42,506
ASHLEY: Okay. I'll pass my weapons out this turn.

1881
02:29:42,506 --> 02:29:48,872
MATT: Okay, so you'll spend your action throwing
them out to the individuals. So your shortsword

1882
02:29:48,872 --> 02:29:52,648
and crossbow clatter to the ground, and you
quickly scramble to grab them. Caleb's dagger

1883
02:29:52,648 --> 02:29:58,282
falls at his foot. Your staff gets tossed quickly
from behind you. Your falchion meets your arm.

1884
02:29:58,282 --> 02:30:00,304
SAM and MARISHA: Falchion.

1885
02:30:00,304 --> 02:30:03,642
MATT: All right. That ends Yasha's turn. Fjord,
you're up.

1886
02:30:03,642 --> 02:30:09,482
TRAVIS: Can I run up with the falchion within
melee?

1887
02:30:09,482 --> 02:30:19,640
MATT: You actually rush through Jester's form. You
watch the image dissipate as you charge through it

1888
02:30:19,640 --> 02:30:27,119
and meet up, face-to-face, with this large,
gnarled, horrible-looking creature. What are you doing?

1889
02:30:27,119 --> 02:30:29,597
TRAVIS: Ripping the falchion, can I swing it into
the creature?

1890
02:30:29,597 --> 02:30:31,132
MATT: You may.

1891
02:30:31,132 --> 02:30:33,781
LAURA: And you get advantage.

1892
02:30:33,781 --> 02:30:40,428
TRAVIS: I do? Thank god, because that was a one.
18.

1893
02:30:40,428 --> 02:30:42,164
MATT: 18 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

1894
02:30:42,164 --> 02:30:43,364
TRAVIS: Nice.

1895
02:30:43,364 --> 02:30:46,017
SAM: It's a real fight!

1896
02:30:46,017 --> 02:30:47,167
MATT: Yeah.

1897
02:30:47,167 --> 02:30:48,603
TRAVIS: 11.

1898
02:30:48,603 --> 02:30:52,076
SAM: We've got like a dozen hit points, we'll be
okay.

1899
02:30:52,076 --> 02:31:00,342
MATT: All righty. That ends your turn? All right,
you're done. That brings us to Caleb.

1900
02:31:00,342 --> 02:31:05,151
LIAM: I would like to use my movement to push as
far into the crowd as I can.

1901
02:31:05,151 --> 02:31:06,910
MATT: Okay, going through the crowd is--

1902
02:31:06,910 --> 02:31:11,239
LIAM: Half-movement? That's fine, sure. I just
want people in front of me.

1903
02:31:11,239 --> 02:31:13,871
MATT: Push through to about there. You end up
pushing a kid out of the way.

1904
02:31:13,871 --> 02:31:19,390
LIAM: That's great. That's exactly fine with me
and I will pull out the diamond and cast Chromatic

1905
02:31:19,390 --> 02:31:29,090
Orb, and I will send a ball of cold at the
creature that Fee-ord-- Fjord--

1906
02:31:29,090 --> 02:31:32,396
MATT: All right, go ahead and make a spell
attack.

1907
02:31:32,396 --> 02:31:33,852
LIAM: Yes, here it comes.

1908
02:31:33,852 --> 02:31:35,973
SAM: Watch out for Fee-ord.

1909
02:31:35,973 --> 02:31:40,504
(laughter)

1910
02:31:40,504 --> 02:31:43,163
LIAM: My goodness. That is a 17.

1911
02:31:43,163 --> 02:31:44,916
MATT: 17 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

1912
02:31:44,916 --> 02:31:47,715
LAURA: Isn't Chromatic Orb like a really strong
spell?

1913
02:31:47,715 --> 02:31:48,793
LIAM: No.

1914
02:31:48,793 --> 02:31:54,377
MATT: There's Prismatic Spray. Chromatic is the
starter version.

1915
02:31:54,377 --> 02:31:55,747
LIAM: That is nine.

1916
02:31:55,747 --> 02:32:00,350
ALL: Nein!

1917
02:32:00,350 --> 02:32:02,135
MATT: (German accent) All right, very well done,
Caleb.

1918
02:32:02,135 --> 02:32:04,661
LIAM: (thicker German accent) Now is the part
where we dance.

1919
02:32:04,661 --> 02:32:09,696
MATT: So as you push the child out of the way,
turn, putting your pocketed diamond out in front

1920
02:32:09,696 --> 02:32:14,746
of you, you focus and you watch as this beam of
light blue energy streaks past, just barely

1921
02:32:14,746 --> 02:32:19,518
coasting between a few heads. It slams into this
creature, as crystals form where the

1922
02:32:19,518 --> 02:32:26,592
wound and impact was. It cracks back into place
where it was. End of your turn? All right. Nott,

1923
02:32:26,592 --> 02:32:27,755
you're up.

1924
02:32:27,755 --> 02:32:36,173
SAM: Okay. Having seen the beautiful dwarven--
girl, was it? Who sang and soothed a monster

1925
02:32:36,173 --> 02:32:44,760
earlier in the show, I'm going to attempt to sing
and soothe this monster. So I step forward and I

1926
02:32:44,760 --> 02:32:56,083
open my mouth, and I sing, (singing badly) And I
will always soothe you!

1927
02:32:56,083 --> 02:33:00,673
LAURA: Can I shoot an arrow at Nott?

1928
02:33:00,673 --> 02:33:03,406
LIAM: He's killing the memory of Scanlan.

1929
02:33:03,406 --> 02:33:06,375
MARISHA: I know, can't let that go.

1930
02:33:06,375 --> 02:33:07,983
MATT: Make a performance check.

1931
02:33:07,983 --> 02:33:14,760
SAM: Performance check. Ooh, it's really good. 18,
minus three, so that's 15.

1932
02:33:14,760 --> 02:33:19,634
MATT: Okay. As you're singing out this discordant
sound, folks nearby are covering their ears and

1933
02:33:19,634 --> 02:33:24,830
glancing back and looking in surprise at this
strange creature giving off this--

1934
02:33:24,830 --> 02:33:26,130
SAM: Does it die?

1935
02:33:26,130 --> 02:33:31,739
MATT: No. However, it now, after taking a few hits
nearby, its red eyes-- or at least one red eye

1936
02:33:31,739 --> 02:33:36,097
slips over to look in your direction. That's as
much of an effect.

1937
02:33:36,097 --> 02:33:37,275
SAM: Fuck!

1938
02:33:37,275 --> 02:33:39,044
(laughter)

1939
02:33:39,044 --> 02:33:40,363
MATT: Do you want to move, or are you going to
stay there?

1940
02:33:40,363 --> 02:33:46,017
SAM: Yes, I'm going to move, and I'm going to dash
behind somebody in the crowd, some weak-looking

1941
02:33:46,017 --> 02:33:47,437
individual.

1942
02:33:47,437 --> 02:33:52,655
MATT: Okay. You can get behind there. Okay. All
right, that ends your turn?

1943
02:33:52,655 --> 02:33:54,573
LIAM: That's our M.O., baby!

1944
02:33:54,573 --> 02:33:55,813
MATT: Beau, you're up.

1945
02:33:55,813 --> 02:34:05,177
MARISHA: Oh shit, okay. To RP my tragic one on the
first fucking battle a little bit, I'll turn to

1946
02:34:05,177 --> 02:34:13,953
everybody and go, guys, no, it's part of the show.
Molly said that people die. She was just a claque.

1947
02:34:13,953 --> 02:34:26,023
Okay. And then I run and I'm going to tackle the
zombie guy. Can I see if I can grapple him?

1948
02:34:26,023 --> 02:34:30,580
MATT: You can certainly, on the first attack. Go
for it. Make an athletics check.

1949
02:34:30,580 --> 02:34:37,171
MARISHA: Just straight athletics. Oh god. Do I
keep that? It's not good.

1950
02:34:37,171 --> 02:34:39,585
(laughter)

1951
02:34:39,585 --> 02:34:40,898
MARISHA: Seven.

1952
02:34:40,898 --> 02:34:45,754
MATT: 17. You attempt with your first strike, and
the creature just breaks away. Its strength is far

1953
02:34:45,754 --> 02:34:49,564
more than you imagined it would be from what was
originally an elderly-looking frame.

1954
02:34:49,564 --> 02:34:56,765
MARISHA: I go, oh, fuck that. I don't know if
that's true, and I'm going to do a flurry of blows

1955
02:34:56,765 --> 02:35:03,318
and do two, pop-pop. That's unarmed, right?
Pop-pop.

1956
02:35:03,318 --> 02:35:06,360
MATT: That is correct.

1957
02:35:06,360 --> 02:35:09,522
MARISHA: I do two, right?

1958
02:35:09,522 --> 02:35:11,207
MATT: Yes, if you're using your ki point to do
that, yes.

1959
02:35:11,207 --> 02:35:18,152
MARISHA: Yes, I am. So first one, it's plus six?
Okay. First one is 19. No, 20. First one is 20

1960
02:35:18,152 --> 02:35:20,974
total, and then the second one is 15 total.

1961
02:35:20,974 --> 02:35:22,764
MATT: Both hit. Roll damage for each.

1962
02:35:22,764 --> 02:35:28,115
MARISHA: Okay. Not great.

1963
02:35:28,115 --> 02:35:29,612
SAM: What are those dice?

1964
02:35:29,612 --> 02:35:39,573
MARISHA: They're d4s, they're just fancy d4s.
Yeah. That is four, eight, 11 points of damage.

1965
02:35:39,573 --> 02:35:45,873
MATT: Between both? Great. So after the grapple
fails and it pushes you away, you go ahead and

1966
02:35:45,873 --> 02:35:49,859
pull back and then leap, kick it in the chest and
then uppercut it in the chin.

1967
02:35:49,859 --> 02:35:51,239
MARISHA: Yeah, that's cool.

1968
02:35:51,239 --> 02:35:58,598
MATT: Looks back towards you. So that would be
putting you up base-to-base with it there. All

1969
02:35:58,598 --> 02:36:02,833
righty. Ending your turn? Okay, at that point, the
crowd is now screaming and begins to swell and

1970
02:36:02,833 --> 02:36:09,136
push in this direction. These folks all begin to
run back and around this way. This crowd begins to

1971
02:36:09,136 --> 02:36:15,227
push, the guards are trying to push forward, and they
can only get a little ways forward to there and

1972
02:36:15,227 --> 02:36:19,057
there. Everyone just shifts out this direction.

1973
02:36:19,057 --> 02:36:21,593
LAURA: God, somebody's going to get trampled.

1974
02:36:21,593 --> 02:36:24,362
SAM: It's really a hazard. They should have had
more exits.

1975
02:36:24,362 --> 02:36:26,234
LAURA: I mean, it's a fire hazard, for sure.

1976
02:36:26,234 --> 02:36:30,749
MATT: Caleb and Nott, I need you both to make
dexterity saving throws.

1977
02:36:30,749 --> 02:36:35,788
SAM: 15.

1978
02:36:35,788 --> 02:36:41,988
LIAM: Oh, pretty good. That is 17 for me.

1979
02:36:42,044 --> 02:36:46,675
MATT: All right. You both manage to just bob and
weave through the crowd to prevent being trampled

1980
02:36:46,675 --> 02:36:50,811
and backing away from the chaos as people are
pushing through. The entrance is too small for

1981
02:36:50,811 --> 02:36:53,823
everyone to leave, and there's now a giant
bottleneck that's beginning to push up as people

1982
02:36:53,823 --> 02:36:58,403
are now screaming and trying to get out. They're
crying, and the chaos is just swelling into this

1983
02:36:58,403 --> 02:37:06,402
absolute cacophony. As soon as that finishes, the
devil-toad carrying the dwarven girl, who was

1984
02:37:06,402 --> 02:37:13,436
given a decree, exits out back with her to get her
to safety. These two begin to slowly back away,

1985
02:37:13,436 --> 02:37:18,176
seeing that things seem to be handled? And the
guards making their way in are looking scared at

1986
02:37:18,176 --> 02:37:23,522
each other, not really knowing what to make of the
current chaos. At that point, you watch as the

1987
02:37:23,522 --> 02:37:27,059
woman whose chest was torn into by this creature
suddenly--

1988
02:37:27,059 --> 02:37:30,049
(groaning)

1989
02:37:30,049 --> 02:37:31,911
MATT: --snaps up into place.

1990
02:37:31,911 --> 02:37:37,476
LAURA: Oh, shit. Okay, we have to keep them from
being dead.

1991
02:37:37,476 --> 02:37:40,462
MATT: Top of the round. Jester, you're up.

1992
02:37:40,462 --> 02:37:42,056
LAURA: Oh, god.

1993
02:37:42,056 --> 02:37:45,661
MATT: What was your initiative again?

1994
02:37:45,661 --> 02:37:46,976
TALIESIN: Ten.

1995
02:37:46,976 --> 02:37:52,350
MATT: Ten, oh, shit. That's right, you're with
Nott, that's what happened. So Molly, you go ahead

1996
02:37:52,350 --> 02:37:54,519
and go for your turn as well. My apologies.

1997
02:37:54,519 --> 02:38:01,949
TALIESIN: I'm going to yell to the back, open the
tent wide! And I'm going to pull-- how far away am I?

1998
02:38:01,949 --> 02:38:05,487
MATT: You're right there. You're in the middle of
the crowd as it's swarming around you and Yasha.

1999
02:38:05,487 --> 02:38:15,947
TALIESIN: (sighs) I'm going to run around and see
if I can flank that creature, if I can move

2000
02:38:15,947 --> 02:38:18,359
towards flanking that creature with the other
two.

2001
02:38:18,359 --> 02:38:22,073
MATT: You can't really flank it, but you can get
next to it.

2002
02:38:22,073 --> 02:38:24,323
TALIESIN: All right. Can I get close enough to
take a shot?

2003
02:38:24,323 --> 02:38:25,415
MATT: You can, yeah.

2004
02:38:25,415 --> 02:38:27,059
TRAVIS: Take a shot?

2005
02:38:27,059 --> 02:38:28,669
SAM: You have guns?

2006
02:38:28,669 --> 02:38:30,206
TALIESIN: Well, old habit.

2007
02:38:30,206 --> 02:38:34,681
(laughter)

2008
02:38:34,681 --> 02:38:39,144
TALIESIN: As a bonus, I'm flipping it out, and I'm
going to activate the first sword.

2009
02:38:39,144 --> 02:38:44,211
MATT: Okay, so you watch as Molly pulls the
scimitar out, and as he unsheathes it, draws it

2010
02:38:44,211 --> 02:38:48,436
across the side of his exposed chest, causing a
little bit of blood to spill out, and as it does,

2011
02:38:48,436 --> 02:38:53,973
he pulls the blade out, and you watch as the edge,
suddenly, ice crystals begin to build on the outside

2012
02:38:53,973 --> 02:38:55,212
of the blade.

2013
02:38:55,212 --> 02:38:58,417
TALIESIN: And I'm taking a shot at the creature.

2014
02:38:58,417 --> 02:38:59,682
SAM: Taking a shot?

2015
02:38:59,682 --> 02:39:01,023
TALIESIN: Taking a slice.

2016
02:39:01,023 --> 02:39:02,283
LAURA: Taking a stab.

2017
02:39:02,283 --> 02:39:04,906
SAM: But with bullets.

2018
02:39:04,906 --> 02:39:09,681
TALIESIN: That's 21 to hit.

2019
02:39:09,681 --> 02:39:11,065
MATT: That hits.

2020
02:39:11,065 --> 02:39:18,879
TALIESIN: That's not bad. That's eight points of
damage and one point of ice damage.

2021
02:39:18,879 --> 02:39:20,847
MATT: Okay, so nine points of damage on the first
strike.

2022
02:39:20,847 --> 02:39:23,063
TALIESIN: No, that was my bonus.

2023
02:39:23,063 --> 02:39:26,517
MATT: That was your bonus, that's all you've got.
Okay. So one strike, you cut across, and you watch

2024
02:39:26,517 --> 02:39:31,982
as you cut this wide wound open, exposing the
fleshy organs' interior, but they're frozen where

2025
02:39:31,982 --> 02:39:35,485
the wound cut through, and it's still holding it
together. It's looking like it's starting to hurt

2026
02:39:35,485 --> 02:39:38,029
a bit and fall apart slightly.

2027
02:39:38,029 --> 02:39:40,280
SAM: This is the bigger monster?

2028
02:39:40,280 --> 02:39:41,696
MARISHA: So it's the one I'm fighting?

2029
02:39:41,696 --> 02:39:46,507
MATT: Yes. So that ends your turn, Molly? Brings
us to the top. So Jester, sorry, back to you.

2030
02:39:46,507 --> 02:39:55,567
LAURA: Oh, now I'm worried. I'm worried about
the undead. I don't know. Well, I don't think I

2031
02:39:55,567 --> 02:40:03,018
would know this, so it's okay. I'm going to say to
the air and say, dude, are you here, because this

2032
02:40:03,018 --> 02:40:12,690
is like the coolest shit we've ever seen! And then I'm
going to cast Toll the Dead on the first zombie

2033
02:40:12,690 --> 02:40:16,917
creature guy. And there's a bell that tolls.

2034
02:40:16,917 --> 02:40:21,224
MATT: Toll the Dead.

2035
02:40:21,224 --> 02:40:24,854
MARISHA: Oh, that's fucking rad, dude.

2036
02:40:24,854 --> 02:40:30,617
LAURA: He has to make a wisdom saving throw or
take 1d12 necrotic damage.

2037
02:40:30,617 --> 02:40:35,228
MATT: Natural one. Go ahead and roll a d12.

2038
02:40:35,228 --> 02:40:38,667
LAURA: Oh, three. That's lame.

2039
02:40:38,667 --> 02:40:48,276
MATT: Three points of necrotic damage. So as this
deep temple bell rings out in the air above, you

2040
02:40:48,276 --> 02:40:52,047
watch as this creature who has turned and is
beginning to just whale upon the surrounding

2041
02:40:52,047 --> 02:40:58,850
allies that are curling at its sides, it seems to
retract from the sound and cover its ears briefly

2042
02:40:58,850 --> 02:41:01,014
before angrily lashing out.

2043
02:41:01,014 --> 02:41:06,960
LAURA: And I made that sound like it was coming
from my duplicate, and my duplicate's going to run

2044
02:41:06,960 --> 02:41:11,528
back a little bit and stand next to the pole.
Yeah.

2045
02:41:11,528 --> 02:41:23,984
MATT: Cool. Is that your turn? All right. The
standing creature that's now been sliced,

2046
02:41:23,984 --> 02:41:30,267
bludgeoned, and wounded by all three of you, is
going to go ahead and make two strikes at-- roll

2047
02:41:30,267 --> 02:41:37,112
randomly to see who it goes for. That's going to
be at Beauregard. It swings at you twice, both

2048
02:41:37,112 --> 02:41:44,823
with its giant massive clawed fists, just striking
out towards you. First one is 17 to hit?

2049
02:41:44,823 --> 02:41:46,648
MARISHA: My armor class is 17.

2050
02:41:46,648 --> 02:41:53,653
MATT: Nine points of bludgeoning damage as the
first one just slams you in the chest. You feel

2051
02:41:53,653 --> 02:41:58,322
the wind knocked out of you for a brief second.
The second swing's going to come at you. That's

2052
02:41:58,322 --> 02:41:59,832
going to be a 20 to hit.

2053
02:41:59,832 --> 02:42:03,156
MARISHA: Yup, yup, that hits.

2054
02:42:03,156 --> 02:42:05,405
TRAVIS: This thing's swinging hard. Holy shit.

2055
02:42:05,405 --> 02:42:07,873
MATT: And that's going to be six points of
bludgeoning damage to you.

2056
02:42:07,873 --> 02:42:11,067
LIAM: What are you at, girl?

2057
02:42:11,067 --> 02:42:15,015
MARISHA: Don't worry about it. I'm bad.

2058
02:42:15,015 --> 02:42:19,786
MATT: It slams into you once with the fist, and
the other one grabs into your stomach, abdomen

2059
02:42:19,786 --> 02:42:25,509
region, and the claws dig in, and its jaw unhinges
and drops like a snake's.

2060
02:42:25,509 --> 02:42:33,009
MARISHA: I turn to Fjord and I go, I'm not a
claque, this show's bullshit.

2061
02:42:33,009 --> 02:42:40,504
MATT: The other one is going to rush over towards
you, Mollymauk, as you're the closest one to it,

2062
02:42:40,504 --> 02:42:43,666
and is going to take one swing at you.

2063
02:42:43,666 --> 02:42:48,059
TALIESIN: Yeah, no. I'm going to use Blood
Maladict.

2064
02:42:48,059 --> 02:42:54,876
MATT: Okay, so you're using a reaction? You don't
have to roll anything for it. He just has

2065
02:42:54,876 --> 02:42:55,991
disadvantage on the strike.

2066
02:42:55,991 --> 02:42:57,463
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right, because I'm not
doubling it up.

2067
02:42:57,463 --> 02:43:03,585
MATT: That'll do it. He rolled a 16 and then a
four. So as it swings towards you, you watch as

2068
02:43:03,585 --> 02:43:09,804
suddenly the reddish burning eyes of the second
creature go black, and it goes way too wide and

2069
02:43:09,804 --> 02:43:17,457
misses you. You easily duck out of the way of its
first strike. As it runs past, towards you this

2070
02:43:17,457 --> 02:43:21,786
way, you get an attack of opportunity as it leaves
your attack range to attempt to swing around Molly

2071
02:43:21,786 --> 02:43:23,673
for a second strike. Go for it.

2072
02:43:23,673 --> 02:43:24,953
TRAVIS: That is 16.

2073
02:43:24,953 --> 02:43:26,633
MATT: 16 hits! Go ahead and roll damage.

2074
02:43:26,633 --> 02:43:31,089
TRAVIS: Nice. That is 12 points of damage.

2075
02:43:31,089 --> 02:43:37,859
MATT: With this brief opening as it rushes past
Mollymauk, after its eyes go black, you watch as

2076
02:43:37,859 --> 02:43:44,833
it stumbles, its vision ruined. With that moment,
you swing out with your-- falchion, thank you.

2077
02:43:44,833 --> 02:43:50,135
Yeah, it's falchion, that's right-- and strike
across the back of its shoulder. You see what once

2078
02:43:50,135 --> 02:43:58,190
was this beautiful young woman is now this
swollen, horrible undead form lumbering past, and

2079
02:43:58,190 --> 02:44:01,990
you cut a heavy chunk of meat off of its shoulder.
It curves around and makes a second strike at you,

2080
02:44:01,990 --> 02:44:09,757
Mollymauk. This one without advantage. That's a
natural 19. Yeah, that's a 24 to hit. All right.

2081
02:44:09,757 --> 02:44:14,663
You take eight points of bludgeoning damage, as
the first one, you manage to move out of the way,

2082
02:44:14,663 --> 02:44:18,846
and as you spin your scimitar around, you glance
over just in time to have it clock you right

2083
02:44:18,846 --> 02:44:25,649
across the jaw. Your vision blurs and doubles for
a second. That's going to end their turn. Yasha,

2084
02:44:25,649 --> 02:44:26,766
you're up.

2085
02:44:26,766 --> 02:44:27,903
SAM: All right, Yasha!

2086
02:44:27,903 --> 02:44:41,973
ASHLEY: Can I get to the big beast? Beast number
one? Okay, so this is the first time I've done

2087
02:44:41,973 --> 02:44:48,613
this, so hopefully I won't do this wrong. 
I would like to rage.

2088
02:44:48,613 --> 02:44:52,248
(cheering)

2089
02:44:52,248 --> 02:44:56,971
ASHLEY: I'm going to workshop it, I'll make
something later. For now, it's a placeholder.

2090
02:44:56,971 --> 02:45:01,523
Okay, I would like to rage, and reckless attack?

2091
02:45:01,523 --> 02:45:03,996
MATT: Yeah, you can reckless attack any of your
attacks.

2092
02:45:03,996 --> 02:45:07,047
SAM: Is that something you can do right away? That
sounds like a later thing.

2093
02:45:07,047 --> 02:45:13,362
ASHLEY: Is that something you do later? Okay. I
didn't get a practice shot at this. Okay. So I

2094
02:45:13,362 --> 02:45:16,888
just roll.

2095
02:45:16,888 --> 02:45:18,486
MATT: You roll at advantage.

2096
02:45:18,486 --> 02:45:21,167
ASHLEY: I don't know how to play D&D anymore! I
just forgot how to do it.

2097
02:45:21,167 --> 02:45:23,806
LAURA: Okay, but roll again, you have advantage.

2098
02:45:23,806 --> 02:45:30,203
ASHLEY: Oh, reckless. Okay. 17?

2099
02:45:30,203 --> 02:45:31,651
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

2100
02:45:31,651 --> 02:45:35,222
ASHLEY: I take out my beautiful greatsword.

2101
02:45:35,222 --> 02:45:39,268
MATT: Freshly purchased. In fact, this is the
first time it's seen battle.

2102
02:45:39,268 --> 02:45:41,492
ASHLEY: It is the first time it's seen battle.

2103
02:45:41,492 --> 02:45:46,360
SAM: Google reported a weird influx of 'falchion'
searches.

2104
02:45:46,360 --> 02:45:49,002
(laughter)

2105
02:45:49,002 --> 02:45:50,897
ASHLEY: 13.

2106
02:45:50,897 --> 02:45:53,396
MATT: On the one that's already been damaged?

2107
02:45:53,396 --> 02:45:56,800
ASHLEY: Yeah. The first guy.

2108
02:45:56,800 --> 02:45:58,200
MATT: Yeah, all right.

2109
02:45:58,200 --> 02:46:00,608
ASHLEY: Get the fuck out of my tent!

2110
02:46:00,608 --> 02:46:03,794
(laughter)

2111
02:46:03,794 --> 02:46:14,733
MATT: Yeah, no, it does not make the save-- it
rolled-- yeah. So as you come down with your blade

2112
02:46:14,733 --> 02:46:20,737
and carve through its body, you watch as it curls
back, trying to reform and hold itself, but your

2113
02:46:20,737 --> 02:46:27,778
blow was too strong, and its zombie-ish form
cannot maintain a cohesive hold on its form, and

2114
02:46:27,778 --> 02:46:30,294
you watch as it just crumbles to the ground, no
longer moving.

2115
02:46:30,294 --> 02:46:32,761
(cheering)

2116
02:46:32,761 --> 02:46:34,028
SAM: Yasha!

2117
02:46:34,028 --> 02:46:37,390
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

2118
02:46:37,390 --> 02:46:44,348
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn. As you're there,
growling animalistically towards the creature.

2119
02:46:44,348 --> 02:46:46,875
ASHLEY: Ooh, that feels fun.

2120
02:46:46,875 --> 02:46:50,255
MATT: You have about five more feet of movement,
if you wanted to move.

2121
02:46:50,255 --> 02:46:55,975
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to go a little bit
closer to-- wait, how many more are left? Just

2122
02:46:55,975 --> 02:47:00,912
the other one? Yeah, so I'll get ready for the
other one. So a little bit closer to it.

2123
02:47:00,912 --> 02:47:07,440
MATT: All right. That ends your turn, Yasha.
Fjord, you're up.

2124
02:47:07,440 --> 02:47:16,518
TRAVIS: Shit. I'll turn and head towards
other tree-zombie fuck. I would like to use my

2125
02:47:16,518 --> 02:47:20,321
bonus action to cast Hex on it.

2126
02:47:20,321 --> 02:47:27,870
MATT: Okay. So you watch as Fjord lumbers towards
it, his large, armored half-orc form holding the

2127
02:47:27,870 --> 02:47:34,707
blade in his hand. Puts his hand out, and the
shadows suddenly swirl and gather around this

2128
02:47:34,707 --> 02:47:41,852
zombified woman's form and cling to it, like it's
holding it in place. So with it now hexed, what

2129
02:47:41,852 --> 02:47:43,231
would you like to do?

2130
02:47:43,231 --> 02:47:49,456
TRAVIS: I would like to use my falchion to open it
the fuck up.

2131
02:47:49,456 --> 02:47:51,252
MATT: All right, go for it.

2132
02:47:51,252 --> 02:47:53,878
TRAVIS: 21.

2133
02:47:53,878 --> 02:47:56,429
MATT: That definitely hits. Go ahead and roll
damage.

2134
02:47:56,429 --> 02:48:04,778
TRAVIS: That's 12 points of damage, plus five
points of necrotic damage.

2135
02:48:04,778 --> 02:48:06,435
MATT: 17 points of damage.

2136
02:48:06,435 --> 02:48:08,955
LIAM: Level two, that's major.

2137
02:48:08,955 --> 02:48:14,749
MATT: So, as you rush up, after the shadows gather
around it, it looks up to you, and it pulls back,

2138
02:48:14,749 --> 02:48:20,690
ready to strike, and you just shake your head, and
one large swipe of your falchion carves this giant

2139
02:48:20,690 --> 02:48:27,441
mark across its chest. Where the cloth and flesh
opens, you can see this blackened interior, where

2140
02:48:27,441 --> 02:48:32,779
the muscles are trying to move, almost like worms,
to regather and tighen. All right, that ends your

2141
02:48:32,779 --> 02:48:35,284
turn. That brings us to Caleb.

2142
02:48:35,284 --> 02:48:39,055
LIAM: All right, I know that it's restricted
movement, but I will push this way through the

2143
02:48:39,055 --> 02:48:44,217
crowd so that I have a clearer shot, as far as I
can, and then I will re-up with Chromatic Orb.

2144
02:48:44,217 --> 02:48:48,237
MATT: You can push right about there. You just
barely pull through the crowd to the front to get

2145
02:48:48,237 --> 02:48:49,208
a clear--

2146
02:48:49,208 --> 02:48:50,144
LAURA: Hi, Caleb.

2147
02:48:50,144 --> 02:48:54,424
LIAM: I certainly don't want to do that. I want to
stay in the crowd, behind people, and I will do

2148
02:48:54,424 --> 02:49:03,104
Chromatic Orb again, but this time, I'm going to set it
to acid, so see if it hit. Oh, that's not good,

2149
02:49:03,104 --> 02:49:04,089
it's 11.

2150
02:49:04,089 --> 02:49:10,857
MATT: 11 unfortunately does not hit. So as you
pull it out a second time, you're pushing through

2151
02:49:10,857 --> 02:49:13,967
the crowd and you pull up your diamond, and right
as you're about to release the spell, one of the

2152
02:49:13,967 --> 02:49:18,368
people in the crowd slams into you with her
shoulder and you get jarred off to the side. The

2153
02:49:18,368 --> 02:49:22,922
acid bolt of the Chromatic Orb flies off and
actually burns a hole through the distant tent and

2154
02:49:22,922 --> 02:49:25,438
then vanishes into the night sky.

2155
02:49:25,438 --> 02:49:27,764
LIAM: Hope that didn't hit anyone.

2156
02:49:27,764 --> 02:49:29,762
MATT: All right, that ends your turn, Caleb. Nott,
you're up.

2157
02:49:29,762 --> 02:49:35,454
SAM: Do I have eyes on the biggie? Is Fjord right
next to her?

2158
02:49:35,454 --> 02:49:38,665
MATT: Fjord and Mollymauk are both next to it,
yes.

2159
02:49:38,665 --> 02:49:45,019
SAM: All right. I'm going to peek out behind
whatever patron I'm next to, take out my little

2160
02:49:45,019 --> 02:49:48,126
crossbow and just shoot a little shot.

2161
02:49:48,126 --> 02:49:49,471
MATT: All right, go for it.

2162
02:49:49,471 --> 02:49:50,720
TRAVIS: Is it made of piano wire?

2163
02:49:50,720 --> 02:49:53,351
(laughter)

2164
02:49:53,351 --> 02:49:55,445
SAM: 16.

2165
02:49:55,445 --> 02:49:56,451
MATT: 16 hits.

2166
02:49:56,451 --> 02:49:58,174
LAURA: I like how every time you roll it comes
out.

2167
02:49:58,174 --> 02:50:05,217
SAM: It does. This is very bouncy. Okay, so 1d6,
that's a four, plus four is eight, plus I get

2168
02:50:05,217 --> 02:50:13,693
sneak attack damage, 'cause I'm a rogue. Another
four, so that's 12. Is the creature bigger than

2169
02:50:13,693 --> 02:50:17,198
me? I will use Fury of the Small.

2170
02:50:17,198 --> 02:50:19,758
(cheering)

2171
02:50:19,758 --> 02:50:24,741
SAM: To inflict another two points of damage, so
that's 14 points of damage.

2172
02:50:24,741 --> 02:50:32,745
MATT: Okay. As you pull around the corner and
release your one crossbow bolt, it hits the bottom

2173
02:50:32,745 --> 02:50:38,080
of the chin and pokes out one of the eyes. The eye
goes flying off into the distance as the bolt is

2174
02:50:38,080 --> 02:50:45,748
now jammed outside of the socket. The creature
turns, glancing your direction. It looks pretty

2175
02:50:45,748 --> 02:50:47,712
hurt, but it's still standing.

2176
02:50:47,712 --> 02:50:54,703
SAM: Can I use the rest of my
action-movement-whatever bonus to look at the

2177
02:50:54,703 --> 02:51:01,536
patron I'm next to. Do they have any baubles or
jewelry on them?

2178
02:51:01,536 --> 02:51:04,241
TRAVIS: In this moment?

2179
02:51:04,241 --> 02:51:11,686
MATT: I'll say you can use your bonus action to
just look. There's nothing you can do this turn,

2180
02:51:11,686 --> 02:51:14,602
but next turn, you could. So make a perception
check.

2181
02:51:14,602 --> 02:51:17,018
SAM: Oh, it's just nine.

2182
02:51:17,018 --> 02:51:25,435
MATT: Nine? It's hard to look. You see this what
looks to be late-30s woman dressed in some sort of

2183
02:51:25,435 --> 02:51:31,684
general workers' clothing with a loose apron, and
she's just running and scrambling to get towards

2184
02:51:31,684 --> 02:51:35,579
the exit. You don't see anything of worth on her,
unfortunately. Sorry. All right, Nott, that ends

2185
02:51:35,579 --> 02:51:37,162
your turn. Molly, you're up.

2186
02:51:37,162 --> 02:51:42,566
TALIESIN: I'm still engaged with it, right? Okay,
I'm going to take two swipes.

2187
02:51:42,566 --> 02:51:47,034
MATT: Okay, so you spin around. You pull your
second scimitar out, as part of the strike, one of

2188
02:51:47,034 --> 02:51:51,123
them encased in ice crystals. So the first
strike-- make sure you mark which one's which.

2189
02:51:51,123 --> 02:51:58,599
TALIESIN: Purple's the ice. That's-- the purple is
12 to hit?

2190
02:51:58,599 --> 02:51:59,961
MATT: 12 just barely hits.

2191
02:51:59,961 --> 02:52:07,315
TALIESIN: Ooh. So they both hit, so that's good.
So that's going to be-- or all three, then, because

2192
02:52:07,315 --> 02:52:09,755
the other one is 21 to hit.

2193
02:52:09,755 --> 02:52:11,286
MATT: That hits, yeah.

2194
02:52:11,286 --> 02:52:13,977
TALIESIN: The first one is four points of damage.

2195
02:52:13,977 --> 02:52:15,396
MATT: Four points of damage?

2196
02:52:15,396 --> 02:52:24,506
TALIESIN: I'm sorry, the magic one is six points
plus three ice, so nine points.

2197
02:52:24,506 --> 02:52:26,063
MATT: Nine points of damage, all right.

2198
02:52:26,063 --> 02:52:27,451
TALIESIN: The other one is four points of damage.

2199
02:52:27,451 --> 02:52:36,463
MATT: Okay. So the first strike hits, and as the
scimitar carves through, the body snaps and opens,

2200
02:52:36,463 --> 02:52:43,500
and it snaps back into place, the torso locking
back in. The second strike does how much damage?

2201
02:52:43,500 --> 02:52:44,711
TALIESIN: Four points of damage.

2202
02:52:44,711 --> 02:52:50,591
MATT: Yeah. The second one hits again, and you
watch as the torso spins off. It looks like only the

2203
02:52:50,591 --> 02:52:55,620
spinal column is holding it in place, but it's
managing to maintain its structure as it (snarls).

2204
02:52:55,620 --> 02:52:58,149
That ends your turn.

2205
02:52:58,149 --> 02:53:00,588
TALIESIN: Someone, anyone? Yep.

2206
02:53:00,588 --> 02:53:03,240
MATT: All right, ending Mollymauk's turn, that
brings us to Beau.

2207
02:53:03,240 --> 02:53:05,837
LAURA: Beau, you got this.

2208
02:53:05,837 --> 02:53:10,444
MARISHA: In response to him, I say, I thought you
said you didn't let in the sick!

2209
02:53:10,444 --> 02:53:12,084
TALIESIN: Just kill it!

2210
02:53:12,084 --> 02:53:16,593
MARISHA: I come up and I want to do a flying
Superman (impact).

2211
02:53:16,593 --> 02:53:20,408
MATT: Wham! Go for it.

2212
02:53:20,408 --> 02:53:23,692
MARISHA: First one. Okay. 16?

2213
02:53:23,692 --> 02:53:25,253
MATT: That'll hit. Damage.

2214
02:53:25,253 --> 02:53:30,136
MARISHA: I had my staff-- oh, I had my staff, but
I said--

2215
02:53:30,136 --> 02:53:32,532
LIAM: You said Superman punch, man.

2216
02:53:32,532 --> 02:53:38,630
MARISHA: It's fine, it's fine. Six damage.

2217
02:53:38,630 --> 02:53:45,034
MATT: Six points of damage. Natural 20. You watch
as you sock it in the face and the jaw breaks and

2218
02:53:45,034 --> 02:53:49,433
then snaps back into place. As you land, pulling
it back, you can see some of the teeth are

2219
02:53:49,433 --> 02:53:53,317
actually stuck in your fist as you pull back,
they've broken off into your knuckles.

2220
02:53:53,317 --> 02:53:58,002
MARISHA: I go, oh, come on. I'm going to use my
other ki point to do flurry of blows again, and

2221
02:53:58,002 --> 02:54:07,836
I'm going to try and punch him in the bridge with
the remainder of his teeth.

2222
02:54:07,836 --> 02:54:10,819
MATT: Her teeth, technically, this is the woman
that was killed originally.

2223
02:54:10,819 --> 02:54:13,595
MARISHA: Oh. I'll be like, you were so pretty,
too.

2224
02:54:13,595 --> 02:54:16,594
MATT: Go for it. Two more strikes.

2225
02:54:16,594 --> 02:54:24,898
MARISHA: 19 and 18. Natural. And then, okay.

2226
02:54:24,898 --> 02:54:27,044
LAURA: That's a really pretty dice.

2227
02:54:27,044 --> 02:54:31,563
MARISHA: Eight, 12, 13 damage.

2228
02:54:31,563 --> 02:54:39,220
MATT: Natural one, no. So the second punch, you
swing wide and hit the side of the head, and the neck

2229
02:54:39,220 --> 02:54:45,815
snaps, and it's now stuck in a sideways position.
As it turns, the jaw, it pulls back one of its

2230
02:54:45,815 --> 02:54:51,671
weirdly swollen clawed hands, ready to go for that
open wound in your gut, and as it does,

2231
02:54:51,671 --> 02:54:53,923
how do you want to do this?

2232
02:54:53,923 --> 02:54:56,349
(cheering)

2233
02:54:56,349 --> 02:54:58,252
TRAVIS: First one!

2234
02:54:58,252 --> 02:54:59,677
SAM: First blood.

2235
02:54:59,677 --> 02:55:06,197
MARISHA: I'll do the uppercut with the other one,
and the one that has its teeth in it, I want to go

2236
02:55:06,197 --> 02:55:12,057
right between the bridge of the nose and get the
teeth right in the eyes and break the nose bridge

2237
02:55:12,057 --> 02:55:15,145
into the brain. You know that thing? Yeah.

2238
02:55:15,145 --> 02:55:19,094
MATT: And as you do that, you slam into its face.
You watch as the skull caves in, the teeth

2239
02:55:19,094 --> 02:55:25,507
piercing both of the red, bulging eyes. And with
this horrible sucking, sighing sound, it falls

2240
02:55:25,507 --> 02:55:31,942
onto its back, no longer moving, the shadows
released.

2241
02:55:31,942 --> 02:55:40,915
MARISHA: I grab my gash and fucked-up ribs and
immediately turn over me. Can I do a perception

2242
02:55:40,915 --> 02:55:45,521
check or an insight check on any of the
ringleaders? On any of what was going on? The

2243
02:55:45,521 --> 02:55:46,807
ringleader or the jester?

2244
02:55:46,807 --> 02:55:53,258
MATT: That was your turn, unfortunately. That's
your turn. At this point, the current threats are

2245
02:55:53,258 --> 02:55:59,243
down, and the crowd is screaming and rushing. The
two members of the Crown's Guard are rushed to the

2246
02:55:59,243 --> 02:56:03,850
front, weapons ready, and they see both of these
creatures bloodied and ruined across the base of

2247
02:56:03,850 --> 02:56:09,598
this. In the midst of the chaos, one of them
points and goes, "You, you! Stay where you are!"

2248
02:56:09,598 --> 02:56:15,684
And you watch as the rest of the crowd slowly
pushes through, you see as Gustav

2249
02:56:15,684 --> 02:56:21,704
manages to make his way in. "Dear god, what's
happened here?" Looks over toward Bo the Breaker,

2250
02:56:21,704 --> 02:56:27,402
the half-orc who's now joined the rest of you.
"Sir, I don't know how he got in here." And

2251
02:56:27,402 --> 02:56:33,494
everyone looks around back at you. Bo looks at
you, Gustav looks to you, Molly. "What happened?"

2252
02:56:33,494 --> 02:56:35,948
TALIESIN: One of them turned. I don't know what
happened.

2253
02:56:35,948 --> 02:56:42,636
LAURA: There was a sick guy! There was an old sick
guy and he turned into a zombie! And I run over

2254
02:56:42,636 --> 02:56:44,956
and I cast Cure Wounds on Beau.

2255
02:56:44,956 --> 02:56:48,505
MARISHA: Oh, thank you, man. I'm really down.

2256
02:56:48,505 --> 02:56:56,225
LAURA: Are you sick too? Did you get hurt? Hold on
two seconds. I'm going to cure her and then I'll

2257
02:56:56,225 --> 02:56:57,970
cure you too.

2258
02:56:57,970 --> 02:57:00,470
TRAVIS: Yasha, have you ever seen anything like
this happen before?

2259
02:57:00,470 --> 02:57:03,677
ASHLEY: No. Never.

2260
02:57:03,677 --> 02:57:06,846
LAURA: Seven points, that's all I could cure.

2261
02:57:06,846 --> 02:57:09,870
MARISHA: That's amazing. That's great.

2262
02:57:09,870 --> 02:57:12,396
TALIESIN: I'm going to drop my sword.

2263
02:57:12,396 --> 02:57:14,347
LAURA: Oh, that's better for you, ten for you.

2264
02:57:14,347 --> 02:57:20,473
MATT: Okay. At this point, the two Crown's Guard
that are there are trying desperately to maintain

2265
02:57:20,473 --> 02:57:25,453
control. You can see they're visibly shaken, and
they glance at each other like they're a little

2266
02:57:25,453 --> 02:57:29,864
out of their depths at the moment. "Stay where you
are. Don't go anywhere."

2267
02:57:29,864 --> 02:57:32,231
TALIESIN: Oh, wherever will I go.

2268
02:57:32,231 --> 02:57:35,683
MATT: And he turns to the one who's in the front,
looks to the other one who just made his way

2269
02:57:35,683 --> 02:57:44,041
through, and goes, "Sivelmen, find someone. Bring
the rest of the guard. Please!" "Right now, sir."

2270
02:57:44,041 --> 02:57:50,216
And he pushes his way towards the back as the rest
of the crowd runs out. Now everyone in the crowd

2271
02:57:50,216 --> 02:57:55,594
has mostly pushed out of the tent, the last few
dregs pushing through. Children crying, people of

2272
02:57:55,594 --> 02:58:00,538
Trostenwald just exiting out the flaps as they
close, and you're all standing there, weapons in

2273
02:58:00,538 --> 02:58:02,336
your hands, wondering what to do.

2274
02:58:02,336 --> 02:58:04,315
TRAVIS: What are the corpses doing now that
they've fallen?

2275
02:58:04,315 --> 02:58:07,859
MATT: They're both unmoving, ruined, torn apart.

2276
02:58:07,859 --> 02:58:11,851
LAURA: Can I search the corpse of the woman?

2277
02:58:11,851 --> 02:58:16,936
MATT: You can. As you go to move to it, both of
your forms merge. The Crown's Guard goes like,

2278
02:58:16,936 --> 02:58:18,518
"Don't move."

2279
02:58:18,518 --> 02:58:20,482
LAURA: Which one?

2280
02:58:20,482 --> 02:58:26,364
MATT: "Both? Uh." He looks genuinely confused.

2281
02:58:26,364 --> 02:58:31,838
LAURA: When I'm going "which one?" I make my
second form just dart forward and start searching

2282
02:58:31,838 --> 02:58:33,232
the body.

2283
02:58:33,232 --> 02:58:39,694
MATT: Okay. It mimics searching a body. It's not
actually you. Begins rifling imaginary things out

2284
02:58:39,694 --> 02:58:41,005
of the pockets.

2285
02:58:41,005 --> 02:58:43,391
LAURA: Look at all the stuff that that one's
finding over there!

2286
02:58:43,391 --> 02:58:45,728
(laughter)

2287
02:58:45,728 --> 02:58:48,192
LAURA: Can he turn and look and I try to search
the other guy?

2288
02:58:48,192 --> 02:58:53,045
MATT: Make a deception check to try and deceive
him to glance over.

2289
02:58:53,045 --> 02:58:57,931
LAURA: Not bad. 19?

2290
02:58:57,931 --> 02:59:05,551
MATT: (laughs) He goes, "What, over there?" Looks
over as you jump over quickly and begin searching

2291
02:59:05,551 --> 02:59:08,929
through it, and you guys watch her do this, and
there's a clear line of sight. As soon as he turns

2292
02:59:08,929 --> 02:59:11,952
back, he's going to notice her rifling through the
other corpse.

2293
02:59:11,952 --> 02:59:14,045
ASHLEY: Is Gustav still in here?

2294
02:59:14,045 --> 02:59:21,219
MATT: Gustav is now walking up, and he's hands up
in the air. "I'm terribly sorry. I-- this has

2295
02:59:21,219 --> 02:59:23,502
"never happened. I don't know what happened. What
happened?!"

2296
02:59:23,502 --> 02:59:29,084
TALIESIN: We've never seen anything like it
before. He just-- he gripped his heart and fell

2297
02:59:29,084 --> 02:59:30,862
over and turned into that thing.

2298
02:59:30,862 --> 02:59:34,849
ASHLEY: It was when Toya started singing.

2299
02:59:34,849 --> 02:59:37,687
MARISHA: Yeah, what's with the dwarven girl?
Why--

2300
02:59:37,687 --> 02:59:39,048
TALIESIN: Nothing like this.

2301
02:59:39,048 --> 02:59:42,459
MATT: "She's been singing with us for over two
years, now."

2302
02:59:42,459 --> 02:59:45,206
MARISHA: How'd she come to you? She's a pretty
young girl.

2303
02:59:45,206 --> 02:59:50,726
MATT: "She had no family and she was singing in
the street for change. There was an opportunity.

2304
02:59:50,726 --> 02:59:53,664
"We seized it. We gave her a family she didn't
have."

2305
02:59:53,664 --> 02:59:55,230
TRAVIS: Put your hands down.

2306
02:59:55,230 --> 03:00:01,124
MATT: The Crown's Guard goes like (grunts). "It's
fine, just don't move."

2307
03:00:01,124 --> 03:00:04,573
LAURA: Did I find anything?

2308
03:00:04,573 --> 03:00:06,884
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2309
03:00:06,884 --> 03:00:10,909
SAM: She uses a different dice for everything,
Travis?

2310
03:00:10,909 --> 03:00:11,967
LAURA: Shut up.

2311
03:00:11,967 --> 03:00:13,433
SAM: Is that what I'm dealing with now?

2312
03:00:13,433 --> 03:00:14,825
TRAVIS: You're not even ready.

2313
03:00:14,825 --> 03:00:16,276
LAURA: 14?

2314
03:00:16,276 --> 03:00:31,420
MATT: You manage to rifle through the old man's
body, through the stringy bits of gore, and you do

2315
03:00:31,420 --> 03:00:44,331
find three pieces of silver that are just coated
in blood. A few moments pass. The rest of the

2316
03:00:44,331 --> 03:00:50,267
people are gone, and it's just this awkward quiet,
and at this point you watch as Ornna, the fire

2317
03:00:50,267 --> 03:00:55,662
fairy who had previously performed, walks in and
is like, "I'm sorry. What has happened here?"

2318
03:00:55,662 --> 03:01:01,472
LAURA: Your little dwarf girl was singing, and she
turns people into zombies.

2319
03:01:01,472 --> 03:01:04,726
TALIESIN: I feel that that was entirely
coincidental. I'm really not sure that the two

2320
03:01:04,726 --> 03:01:08,486
things were related. Something was wrong with this
man.

2321
03:01:08,486 --> 03:01:11,835
MARISHA: See, it's interesting, because I would
say the opposite. I would say it wasn't that

2322
03:01:11,835 --> 03:01:13,176
coincidental, because--

2323
03:01:13,176 --> 03:01:15,218
LIAM: I would agree, it seemed to happen with
this--

2324
03:01:15,218 --> 03:01:19,159
TALIESIN: We've seen her sing dozens, hundreds of
times. Nothing like this has ever happened. I've

2325
03:01:19,159 --> 03:01:22,500
seen people sit in the front row hundreds of
times. Nothing like this has ever happened.

2326
03:01:22,500 --> 03:01:24,670
LIAM: Have you had the elderly or the sick in
these tents before?

2327
03:01:24,670 --> 03:01:30,317
MARISHA: Yeah, you also happen to be very explicit
on your page that you don't want the sick, so.

2328
03:01:30,317 --> 03:01:31,529
TALIESIN: Gustav.

2329
03:01:31,529 --> 03:01:37,008
MATT: At this motion, Gustav goes, "It's generally
just because we want to promote a space of

2330
03:01:37,008 --> 03:01:44,365
"welcoming cleanliness. When we're working amongst
the outskirts of the Empire, we don't want to

2331
03:01:44,365 --> 03:01:47,809
"bring an element that reminds you of death and--"

2332
03:01:47,809 --> 03:01:50,779
SAM: You hate old people so much.

2333
03:01:50,779 --> 03:01:57,389
MATT: "Well, we're in entertainment. We have to be
cautious." The single Crown's Guard guy who's

2334
03:01:57,389 --> 03:02:00,808
sitting there with his weapon out, you can see him
shaking almost, he's never had to deal with

2335
03:02:00,808 --> 03:02:02,571
anyting like this before.

2336
03:02:02,571 --> 03:02:07,841
TALIESIN: Hold up. I've never seen that one
before. He looks really suspicious.

2337
03:02:07,841 --> 03:02:09,406
MATT: Towards him?

2338
03:02:09,406 --> 03:02:11,278
TALIESIN: No, the guy behind him.

2339
03:02:11,278 --> 03:02:13,829
LAURA: (gasps) He does look suspicious.

2340
03:02:13,829 --> 03:02:15,258
MATT: Make a deception check.

2341
03:02:15,258 --> 03:02:20,068
TALIESIN: Sure. Eight.

2342
03:02:20,068 --> 03:02:27,312
MATT: He goes, "Don't try that on me. I've been
doing this for over ten years."

2343
03:02:27,312 --> 03:02:29,136
ASHLEY: Oh wait, look at him!

2344
03:02:29,136 --> 03:02:32,653
LAURA: I cast Thaumaturgy and make it sound like
there's a sound coming from behind him, too.

2345
03:02:32,653 --> 03:02:36,873
MATT: Make a sleight-of-hand check to see if you
can cast this spell subtly enough or not.

2346
03:02:36,873 --> 03:02:38,933
SAM: This poor guard. Ooh!

2347
03:02:38,933 --> 03:02:42,815
(groaning)

2348
03:02:42,815 --> 03:02:44,297
LAURA: Natural one.

2349
03:02:44,297 --> 03:02:48,971
MATT: As you attempt to cast this spell, a little
bit of spittle gets caught in your windpipe, and

2350
03:02:48,971 --> 03:02:53,913
you begin to cough uncontrollably. Yeah, it just
falls away.

2351
03:02:53,913 --> 03:02:57,221
LAURA: (coughing) There was some popcorn that I
ate earlier.

2352
03:02:57,221 --> 03:03:01,756
TRAVIS: You should know that whatever happened to
that first man when he attacked the woman, she

2353
03:03:01,756 --> 03:03:03,476
caught whatever he had.

2354
03:03:03,476 --> 03:03:09,528
MATT: "And that is extremely worrying. Nobody
touch that body." And he looks back and sees you

2355
03:03:09,528 --> 03:03:16,174
coughing over the corpse, and the guy's like,
"Don't you touch that body! Are you sick?"

2356
03:03:16,174 --> 03:03:18,452
LAURA: (coughing) I have bloody fingers.

2357
03:03:18,452 --> 03:03:22,320
MATT: "Someone hold her down. If she's sick and
turns into one of these, I will not--"

2358
03:03:22,320 --> 03:03:26,044
ASHLEY: She's fine. Just calm down.

2359
03:03:26,044 --> 03:03:27,872
TALIESIN: Well, we've already killed two of them.

2360
03:03:27,872 --> 03:03:29,701
SAM: She's definitely sick.

2361
03:03:29,701 --> 03:03:31,853
MATT: Make a deception check.

2362
03:03:31,853 --> 03:03:40,347
LAURA: That was cocked, unfortunately. That was a
good one. Oh, well. 16?

2363
03:03:40,347 --> 03:03:45,736
MATT: 16? His face goes white and he goes, "Kill
the thing!" And rushes forward, blade held above.

2364
03:03:45,736 --> 03:03:51,586
ASHLEY: I take out my greatsword.

2365
03:03:51,586 --> 03:03:53,999
SAM: What, you're going to kill a guard?

2366
03:03:53,999 --> 03:03:55,940
ASHLEY: Stop, stop.

2367
03:03:55,940 --> 03:04:01,488
MATT: He holds back. He turns to you and sees you
standing a full four inches taller than him with a

2368
03:04:01,488 --> 03:04:06,936
much larger blade, with one hand, and he goes,
"Look, if she's going to become one of these

2369
03:04:06,936 --> 03:04:08,648
"things, we have to stop her now."

2370
03:04:08,648 --> 03:04:12,069
LAURA: Yasha will totally kill me. Don't worry,
you can leave.

2371
03:04:12,069 --> 03:04:18,619
MARISHA: Jester. Jokes are great until they get
you killed, man. She's joking.

2372
03:04:18,619 --> 03:04:21,580
LAURA: (weak laughter)

2373
03:04:21,580 --> 03:04:26,604
SAM: Poor guard.

2374
03:04:26,604 --> 03:04:30,236
MATT: Immediately rubs his eyes. You can see him,
now that he's closer to you, you can see he's

2375
03:04:30,236 --> 03:04:37,257
sweating, he's scared, he's generally trying the
best he can to use whatever training he's received

2376
03:04:37,257 --> 03:04:39,079
to deal with a scenario he was not trained for.

2377
03:04:39,079 --> 03:04:40,563
MARISHA: This is the King's Guard guy?

2378
03:04:40,563 --> 03:04:45,464
MATT: One of the Crown's Guard. The Crown's Guard
are all generally hired and trained militia that

2379
03:04:45,464 --> 03:04:47,146
are sent amongst all the cities to keep the
peace.

2380
03:04:47,146 --> 03:04:49,374
MARISHA: What's your name, man?

2381
03:04:49,374 --> 03:04:55,259
TALIESIN: Wow, he's really shook up.

2382
03:04:55,259 --> 03:04:56,842
SAM: Jamieson.

2383
03:04:56,842 --> 03:05:00,016
MATT: "Flynn."

2384
03:05:00,016 --> 03:05:04,023
MARISHA: Flynn. How long you been doing this, you
said ten years?

2385
03:05:04,023 --> 03:05:06,953
MATT: "Ten years two months ago."

2386
03:05:06,953 --> 03:05:16,329
MARISHA: Oh. Happy ten year-i-versary. Yeah,
congrats. Did you get a nice watch or like a

2387
03:05:16,329 --> 03:05:17,686
commemorative tankard?

2388
03:05:17,686 --> 03:05:18,945
TRAVIS: They don't have watches yet.

2389
03:05:18,945 --> 03:05:21,313
MARISHA: Shit. Did you get a commemorative
tankard? Forget the watch part.

2390
03:05:21,313 --> 03:05:24,720
MATT: "No. Don't move."

2391
03:05:24,720 --> 03:05:34,995
MARISHA: I'm not moving, man. Hey. Hey, Flynn.
Hey, man. How about first we put the swords down,

2392
03:05:34,995 --> 03:05:38,266
because we helped? Yeah.

2393
03:05:38,266 --> 03:05:44,788
SAM: Are any of us high charisma? 'Cause it don't
seem like it.

2394
03:05:44,788 --> 03:05:48,755
MATT: At this point, the flaps at the front of the
tent, the entranceway, fold in and you watch as

2395
03:05:48,755 --> 03:05:59,099
one, two, three, four, six, ten Crown's Guard
begin filtering into the chamber. You watch as one

2396
03:05:59,099 --> 03:06:07,765
man, the one who has his helmet off and under his
shoulder, he's maybe in his early 40s or so, short

2397
03:06:07,765 --> 03:06:13,449
brown hair with patches of grey. Somewhat
jaundiced skin. Molly, you've encountered this man

2398
03:06:13,449 --> 03:06:18,860
once before when you entered the city. He
approaches Gustav right now with a commanding

2399
03:06:18,860 --> 03:06:28,132
voice. "I had a gut feeling that you were nothing
but trouble when you came into our town." Gustav

2400
03:06:28,132 --> 03:06:34,954
turns around. "I guarantee to you, my friend, I
have no idea--" "What happened here?" The Crown's

2401
03:06:34,954 --> 03:06:43,351
Guard who's been shaken turns around and goes,
"Sir, Flynn. There was a creature. This carnival

2402
03:06:43,351 --> 03:06:51,167
"seemed to create some sort of terrible entity that
killed and then created a secondary beast. I

2403
03:06:51,167 --> 03:06:57,988
"watched it with my own eyes from the back row."
And the man turns back towards Gustav and the rest

2404
03:06:57,988 --> 03:07:01,421
of you. "And who else saw that?"

2405
03:07:01,421 --> 03:07:02,991
TRAVIS: We did.

2406
03:07:02,991 --> 03:07:08,433
LAURA: Well, we saw an old guy turn into a zombie.
But it's possible that he just died because he was

2407
03:07:08,433 --> 03:07:14,600
old, and then he had the zombie curse on him and
just turned, you know? Because that happens a lot.

2408
03:07:14,600 --> 03:07:19,414
TALIESIN: (deadpan) Gustav, it's no use, we've
been found out. Our terrible plot to make a zombie

2409
03:07:19,414 --> 03:07:23,920
rampage through our carnival has been discovered.
Whatever will we do now that we've been discovered

2410
03:07:23,920 --> 03:07:28,723
for our brilliant plot to make a zombie ruin our
circus. My god.

2411
03:07:28,723 --> 03:07:31,859
MATT: Flynn turns to you and goes, "Put your
weapons down or we'll arrest you immediately!"

2412
03:07:31,859 --> 03:07:34,076
TALIESIN: I'm literally holding nothing but my
hands.

2413
03:07:34,076 --> 03:07:37,867
LIAM: I mean, I'm sorry, but we're basically a
group of strangers. Most of us don't know each

2414
03:07:37,867 --> 03:07:43,533
other. We all have the same story. There was a
show, an old man became a thing, and we helped

2415
03:07:43,533 --> 03:07:46,777
destroy it. This one destroyed it. What more do
you want from us?

2416
03:07:46,777 --> 03:07:48,293
TALIESIN: It ruined our show.

2417
03:07:48,293 --> 03:07:54,675
MATT: Flynn turns back and says, "Watchmaster,
what should we do?" And the man with the helmet

2418
03:07:54,675 --> 03:07:58,536
under his arm walks forward, walks to Gustav,
gives him one look over, still a few inches

2419
03:07:58,536 --> 03:08:06,897
shorter than him. Looks at him with a sense of
purpose and social status that has a sense of

2420
03:08:06,897 --> 03:08:19,739
disinterest and disrespect. "You, sir, and your
orc, and your circus, are considered currently

2421
03:08:19,739 --> 03:08:29,629
"under arrest. Who else belongs to your merry
band?" He looks about the rest and Gustav goes,

2422
03:08:29,629 --> 03:08:43,438
"The orc." Glances back at the two of you and
goes, "The rest of them are just purveyors of our

2423
03:08:43,438 --> 03:08:50,445
"performances. He was just joking earlier, right?"
Make a deception check.

2424
03:08:50,445 --> 03:08:52,954
SAM: Oh boy.

2425
03:08:52,954 --> 03:08:57,317
TALIESIN: Nope.

2426
03:08:57,317 --> 03:09:08,006
MATT: "And you are also under arrest. The rest of
you, what are your names?"

2427
03:09:08,006 --> 03:09:09,921
LAURA: Shirley.

2428
03:09:09,921 --> 03:09:11,802
SAM: Temple.

2429
03:09:11,802 --> 03:09:14,964
(muffled laughter)

2430
03:09:14,964 --> 03:09:17,476
LIAM: Caleb Widogast.

2431
03:09:17,476 --> 03:09:21,704
MARISHA: Beau, same as him.

2432
03:09:21,704 --> 03:09:23,272
TRAVIS: Bo.

2433
03:09:23,272 --> 03:09:25,562
(laughter)

2434
03:09:25,562 --> 03:09:27,160
SAM: I am Bo!

2435
03:09:27,160 --> 03:09:31,292
TRAVIS: You pointed at me.

2436
03:09:31,292 --> 03:09:34,906
MARISHA: I meant the NPC Bo! But it works!

2437
03:09:34,906 --> 03:09:46,968
ASHLEY: Here's the thing. Oh, it's Mary by the
way, but I think I know who might know what has

2438
03:09:46,968 --> 03:09:48,719
happened here.

2439
03:09:48,719 --> 03:09:50,012
MATT: "Do you? Tell me."

2440
03:09:50,012 --> 03:09:53,761
ASHLEY: I'll have to go get her.

2441
03:09:53,761 --> 03:09:57,536
MATT: "Who is this?"

2442
03:09:57,536 --> 03:10:01,943
ASHLEY: She is the singer that made this all
happen.

2443
03:10:01,943 --> 03:10:11,269
MATT: "Flynn, escort this woman to retrieve this
individual she speaks of." Flynn nods and walks

2444
03:10:11,269 --> 03:10:12,926
over towards you.

2445
03:10:12,926 --> 03:10:18,488
LAURA: She's really shy, though, and I hear she
only talks to tieflings, so you should probably send--

2446
03:10:18,488 --> 03:10:20,196
MATT: "Stay where you are."

2447
03:10:20,196 --> 03:10:22,560
LAURA: --my brother along, because he's really good
with that stuff.

2448
03:10:22,560 --> 03:10:27,708
TALIESIN: Try not to stab any random people on
your way there, Flynn. You're doing good.

2449
03:10:27,708 --> 03:10:34,423
MATT: "My men tell me that the rest of you helped
destroy these fiends. Is that correct?"

2450
03:10:34,423 --> 03:10:36,752
ALL: Yeah.

2451
03:10:36,752 --> 03:10:41,911
MATT: "Then on behalf of the Starosta, I
appreciate your aid. But until this investigation

2452
03:10:41,911 --> 03:10:48,162
"is complete, you are all under investigation from
us. Where are you staying?"

2453
03:10:48,162 --> 03:10:51,286
TRAVIS: The Nestled Nook Inn.

2454
03:10:51,286 --> 03:10:53,863
SAM: Nested Nook.

2455
03:10:53,863 --> 03:10:57,362
MATT: Nestled. He got it right.

2456
03:10:57,362 --> 03:11:00,630
SAM: Oh, shit. One letter. God damn it.

2457
03:11:00,630 --> 03:11:03,321
TRAVIS: I have an intelligence of 14. I know what
I'm doing.

2458
03:11:03,321 --> 03:11:14,637
MATT: "Do not leave this city unless you are told
otherwise. Should you do so, I have your names,

2459
03:11:14,637 --> 03:11:22,906
"and I can have the full might of the Cerberus
Assembly track you down. You. Flynn. Free this

2460
03:11:22,906 --> 03:11:28,247
"girl." While you all stand in the tent, Flynn
approaches you and walks a little bit behind you,

2461
03:11:28,247 --> 03:11:34,956
weapon drawn but at the side. Do you lead him out
of the tent? Okay. So you walk through the

2462
03:11:34,956 --> 03:11:42,802
performer's flap, and as you walk out, you can see
backed up into the number of tents that are set

2463
03:11:42,802 --> 03:11:49,716
up, and some of the carts, other members of the
circus are hiding, and as soon as you exit out

2464
03:11:49,716 --> 03:11:54,063
the front and they see you before the Crown's
Guard, they all immediately scatter and vanish to

2465
03:11:54,063 --> 03:12:01,357
the nearby shadows, out of sight. The two of you
walk out into the center, the fire crackling in a

2466
03:12:01,357 --> 03:12:07,088
small pit off to the side. "All right, where is
this girl you speak of?"

2467
03:12:07,088 --> 03:12:09,720
ASHLEY: She's in the back in the tents.

2468
03:12:09,720 --> 03:12:11,811
MATT: "Show me."

2469
03:12:11,811 --> 03:12:13,907
ASHLEY: Follow me.

2470
03:12:13,907 --> 03:12:19,989
MATT: He follows you. Which tent do you lead him
to? Over here? Okay, there's a larger tent, as he

2471
03:12:19,989 --> 03:12:23,685
walks by your side, there's the flap that's
slightly open.

2472
03:12:23,685 --> 03:12:25,630
SAM: God, you could seduce him.

2473
03:12:25,630 --> 03:12:34,952
ASHLEY: Go get her. She won't talk to me. She's
too scared of me.

2474
03:12:34,952 --> 03:12:40,568
MATT: "All right." Gets his weapon ready and walks
into the tent.

2475
03:12:40,568 --> 03:12:43,466
ASHLEY: I close the tent and I take off.

2476
03:12:43,466 --> 03:12:53,846
MATT: Okay. There's a few moments before, in the
distance, you hear a voice say, "The tent is

2477
03:12:53,846 --> 03:13:02,426
"empty. What are you talking about? Hello?
Helloooo?"

2478
03:13:02,426 --> 03:13:04,245
(laughter)

2479
03:13:04,245 --> 03:13:08,890
MATT: And you don't look back, and you just run
into the darkness of night, into the Marrow Fields

2480
03:13:08,890 --> 03:13:11,731
and disappear.

2481
03:13:11,731 --> 03:13:13,983
SAM: But that's so mysterious.

2482
03:13:13,983 --> 03:13:21,494
LIAM: While that was happening, I'm close to the
edge of the tent, and at some point I just (snap)

2483
03:13:21,494 --> 03:13:30,026
and summoned Frumpkin. I have a 30-feet outside
the tent, so Frumpkin's out there.

2484
03:13:30,026 --> 03:13:37,595
MATT: Okay. Frumpkin keeps watch. The Watchmaster,
as you heard him notified earlier, turns to the

2485
03:13:37,595 --> 03:13:46,720
rest of you. "So. The investigation will begin. If
any information comes to light that could

2486
03:13:46,720 --> 03:13:57,381
"alleviate you of the charges brought to this
carnival, come to me and let me know. If you have

2487
03:13:57,381 --> 03:14:05,002
"no answers before we complete this investigation,
then I believe you all will fall into the judgment."

2488
03:14:05,002 --> 03:14:11,028
LAURA: Next time we don't help. That's what it
comes down to.

2489
03:14:11,028 --> 03:14:15,200
MARISHA: I know, we got paid the first time we
helped, and then we got arrested the second time.

2490
03:14:15,200 --> 03:14:16,754
I don't know what lesson to learn here.

2491
03:14:16,754 --> 03:14:18,268
SAM: Just say okay and let's leave.

2492
03:14:18,268 --> 03:14:19,690
LIAM: Yeah, yeah.

2493
03:14:19,690 --> 03:14:27,071
MATT: So the guards escort you out of the tent.
Molly, you're stuck behind with Gustav and Bo the

2494
03:14:27,123 --> 03:14:34,314
Breaker, with a guard of five Crown's Guards set
to keep watch. As the rest of you are sent to the

2495
03:14:34,314 --> 03:14:43,126
city, the Watchmaster turns once more and says,
"Remember, you flee, I'll find you."

2496
03:14:43,126 --> 03:14:45,926
And that's where we'll end tonight's session.

2497
03:14:45,926 --> 03:14:49,239
SAM: No way! What? No! I want to keep playing.

2498
03:14:49,239 --> 03:14:51,771
TALIESIN: I'm so excited, this is great.

2499
03:14:51,771 --> 03:14:53,513
LIAM: It's a good spot.

2500
03:14:53,513 --> 03:14:56,342
ASHLEY: We did it, we did it.

2501
03:14:56,342 --> 03:14:58,405
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

2502
03:14:58,405 --> 03:15:00,101
LAURA: We have to get Molly out!

2503
03:15:00,101 --> 03:15:03,142
SAM: (sighs) Everything's better with Molly.

2504
03:15:03,142 --> 03:15:07,525
(laughter)

2505
03:15:07,525 --> 03:15:09,574
TALIESIN: Truer words were never spoken.

2506
03:15:09,574 --> 03:15:16,123
MATT: Well, guys, welcome to the new campaign.
Season two, I guess.

2507
03:15:16,123 --> 03:15:17,431
LIAM: Oh my goodness.

2508
03:15:17,431 --> 03:15:19,768
MARISHA: It feels so weird.

2509
03:15:19,768 --> 03:15:24,353
SAM: Look at these cool Wyrmwood cases that we
have!

2510
03:15:24,353 --> 03:15:27,046
MATT: Fucking Sam. I swear to god.

2511
03:15:27,046 --> 03:15:31,944
MARISHA: I used 100% new dice. No repeats from
Keyleth.

2512
03:15:31,944 --> 03:15:33,703
TRAVIS: Yeah, totally new dice.

2513
03:15:33,703 --> 03:15:35,449
TALIESIN: I kept the Gil die.

2514
03:15:35,449 --> 03:15:37,065
LAURA: I used some new dice.

2515
03:15:37,065 --> 03:15:38,646
TRAVIS: What are you talking about?

2516
03:15:38,646 --> 03:15:39,936
LAURA: <i>Some</i> new dice.

2517
03:15:39,936 --> 03:15:42,107
MATT: I used this beautiful little--

2518
03:15:42,107 --> 03:15:44,429
TALIESIN: Fuck you.

2519
03:15:44,429 --> 03:15:46,620
MATT: The Snitch is mine now.

2520
03:15:46,620 --> 03:15:48,926
LIAM: Look at all the 20s Taliesin rolled
tonight.

2521
03:15:48,984 --> 03:15:57,226
MATT: I know. Oh man. I'm excited.

2522
03:15:57,226 --> 03:15:59,257
SAM: Such cool characters, guys!

2523
03:15:59,257 --> 03:16:00,956
MATT: I'm excited to see where this goes.

2524
03:16:00,956 --> 03:16:06,593
SAM: I still don't know what half of you guys are.
What's Travis?

2525
03:16:06,593 --> 03:16:09,528
MATT: Everyone did something that revealed them
tonight.

2526
03:16:09,528 --> 03:16:12,464
SAM: I don't know nothing, I don't know how to
play D&D.

2527
03:16:12,464 --> 03:16:14,869
MARISHA: Should we all say in case you're Sam and
you don't know?

2528
03:16:14,869 --> 03:16:16,313
TRAVIS: I'm a ballerina.

2529
03:16:16,313 --> 03:16:17,814
MARISHA: He's a prima.

2530
03:16:17,814 --> 03:16:25,678
MATT: Well, guys. Happy New Year. Welcome back,
Happy New Year to you guys. Thank you for coming

2531
03:16:25,678 --> 03:16:30,645
along with us on this first episode of a new
journey. Thank you, Backblaze and DnD Beyond, for

2532
03:16:30,645 --> 03:16:36,419
being awesome sponsors partnered with us going
forward. Thank you, Wyrmwood, for this amazing

2533
03:16:36,419 --> 03:16:43,323
table. Thank you guys for coming along with us
this evening for our first dive into this new

2534
03:16:43,323 --> 03:16:46,280
venture. Hope you enjoyed it. We did.

2535
03:16:46,280 --> 03:16:48,283
MARISHA: Thank you to our amazing crew.

2536
03:16:48,283 --> 03:16:53,472
SAM: Thank you, Matt Mercer, for this amazing new
campaign! Welcome to Wildemount.

2537
03:16:53,472 --> 03:16:54,946
MATT: I'm excited.

2538
03:16:54,946 --> 03:16:57,751
SAM: Thanks, Yev.

2539
03:16:57,751 --> 03:17:07,588
MATT: Guys, have a wonderful evening. We'll see
you next week. See where this next stage in the

2540
03:17:07,588 --> 03:17:10,016
story takes us. Ashley, I'm glad you could make it
for this first episode.

2541
03:17:10,016 --> 03:17:12,330
ASHLEY: Yeah, me too.

2542
03:17:12,330 --> 03:17:18,158
MATT: Until then, have a wonderful night, sleep
well, and is it Thursday yet? Good night!

2543
03:17:18,158 --> 03:17:20,887
