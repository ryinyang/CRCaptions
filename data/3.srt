1
00:00:00,157 --> 00:00:02,397
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:02,397 --> 00:00:05,166
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons & Dragons.

3
00:00:05,166 --> 00:00:08,373
(laughter)

4
00:00:08,373 --> 00:00:11,854
MATT: Liam gets ever creative every week right
before the camera goes live. Thank you, Liam.

5
00:00:11,854 --> 00:00:16,003
LIAM: First good one of the campaign, come on.

6
00:00:16,003 --> 00:00:19,081
MATT: Welcome! Before we jump into the game, we
have some announcements, so we'll get through

7
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:25,203
those as quickly as possible. First and foremost,
once again, returning, and for an extended time

8
00:00:25,203 --> 00:00:30,802
for the foreseeable future, we are happy to have a
sponsored partner, D&D Beyond.

9
00:00:30,802 --> 00:00:33,114
(cheering)

10
00:00:33,114 --> 00:00:38,102
MATT: Awesome, fantastic application for those to
make their D&D characters and store them online

11
00:00:38,102 --> 00:00:41,013
and adjust. Sam, do you want to go ahead and take
it away?

12
00:00:41,013 --> 00:00:48,728
SAM: Yes! D&D Beyond is our awesome sponsor. It's
a great online mobile access thing that you can

13
00:00:48,728 --> 00:00:52,790
manage all sorts of stuff. I'm losing my voice
tonight, because--

14
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,224
MARISHA: Oh no!

15
00:00:54,224 --> 00:00:59,202
SAM: Yeah, I know. So that I can preserve my voice
for the rest of the night, Laura, can you read the

16
00:00:59,202 --> 00:01:01,486
copy and I'll lip sync it.

17
00:01:01,486 --> 00:01:02,857
LAURA: The joy of sitting next to you.

18
00:01:02,857 --> 00:01:04,320
SAM: Thank you.

19
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,376
Laura: Oh god. As you know, D&D Beyond is the
official digital tool set for Critical Role. It's

20
00:01:10,376 --> 00:01:15,453
got a ton of features, but one of the coolest is
that it keeps track of stuff like hit points,

21
00:01:15,453 --> 00:01:21,746
inspiration, and all sorts of modifiers to your
dice rolls, which is amazing, especially if you're

22
00:01:21,746 --> 00:01:25,653
the kind of person that's more focused on which
dice you're rolling with.

23
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:27,296
SAM: Keep going.

24
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,719
(laughter)

25
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:33,099
LAURA: You know, the kind of superstitious gamer
that thinks that the color and style of dice

26
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:40,294
actually makes any difference at all. The sort of
weirdo who believes some dice are lucky and some

27
00:01:40,294 --> 00:01:50,735
are cursed. Or one of those crackpot shut-ins who
uses dice jails-- ha ha ha. Those people are lame.

28
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:54,327
Anyway, check them out at w-w-w-dot--

29
00:01:54,327 --> 00:01:55,901
SAM: Oh, keep going.

30
00:01:55,901 --> 00:02:07,097
LAURA: dndbeyond.com That's D-N-D not D-and-D.
DnD. Get $10 off any book in the marketplace with

31
00:02:07,097 --> 00:02:12,537
code 'beginnings.' Also, Sam Riegel is a cock
bag.

32
00:02:12,537 --> 00:02:14,710
SAM: What?! No! That's not what it says!

33
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,057
(laughter)

34
00:02:17,057 --> 00:02:20,155
MATT: Thank you, Sam. Well done.

35
00:02:20,155 --> 00:02:23,038
TALIESIN: Classic, classic.

36
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:28,170
MATT: Thank you, Laura, for the assist. Thank you,
D&D Beyond for being an awesome partners on this

37
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:37,489
new campaign. As a reminder, Talks Machina, with

42
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:08,809

Critical Role comic, Vox Machina: Origins is out!

43
00:03:08,809 --> 00:03:15,392
It's been out for a couple of days now. It's
starting to ramp up towards the story climax in

44
00:03:15,392 --> 00:03:20,460
the next two issues. Pretty excited about it and
the next two issues are crazy.

45
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,800
LIAM: Well-oiled machine, that party.

46
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,301
MATT: Those of us that know what happens in the
next two issues, it's like (quiet squeal) getting

47
00:03:24,301 --> 00:03:25,341
impatient.

48
00:03:25,341 --> 00:03:26,684
SAM: I don't know what happens.

49
00:03:26,684 --> 00:03:32,318
LIAM: Oh my god. I saw some early black and white
pages today.

50
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,218
MATT: Olivia did such a good job. Olivia is our
artist for it. She's from the Critter community.

51
00:03:36,293 --> 00:03:40,416
She's amazing and did an incredible job with the
comic, so show her some love. Olivia Samson is

52
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:44,490
amazing, and Matt Colville, of course, our writer.
Everyone who works on the comic does a great job,

53
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,869
so check it out if you haven't had the chance.
It's available on digital download on the Dark

54
00:03:47,869 --> 00:03:52,749
Horse app, on ComiXology, and a lot of
other awesome places on the internet

55
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:54,839
you can probably find.

56
00:03:54,839 --> 00:03:57,731
MATT: Are you-- oh jeez. Why do we put you two
next to each other?

57
00:03:57,731 --> 00:04:01,526
LAURA: Look, I gave him a dice and he gave me a
dice.

58
00:04:01,526 --> 00:04:04,368
MATT: Aw, that's actually really cute. I apologize
for being so snappy.

59
00:04:04,368 --> 00:04:07,891
(laughter)

60
00:04:07,891 --> 00:04:12,137
MATT: I apologize if I'm a little puffy still. I
had my wisdom teeth taken out.

61
00:04:12,137 --> 00:04:14,955
(cheering)

62
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,276
SAM: When?

63
00:04:16,276 --> 00:04:17,124
MATT: On Saturday.

64
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:18,232
TRAVIS: No anesthetic.

65
00:04:18,232 --> 00:04:19,616
(laughter)

66
00:04:19,616 --> 00:04:21,495
LIAM: Show us your mouth holes!

67
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:23,287
MATT: No, you do not want that.

68
00:04:23,287 --> 00:04:25,220
LAURA: I expected your cheeks to be all poofy.

69
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,481
MATT: They have been throughout the whole week and
steadily, I have been like, "Please, please, don't

70
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:31,145
"be so bad on Thursday." It's okay. Not too bad
today.

71
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,974
LAURA: You look chiseled.

72
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:35,931
MARISHA: He looks fine. It's all in his head.

73
00:04:35,931 --> 00:04:38,804
TRAVIS: Did you dunk your head in a tub of ice and
stuff?

74
00:04:38,804 --> 00:04:42,407
MATT: A lot of ice. A lot of ice. But that's
enough about me and my gum holes.

75
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,613
(laughter)

76
00:04:45,613 --> 00:04:47,945
LIAM: I would like to hide behind 50 characters
now.

77
00:04:47,945 --> 00:04:53,557
MATT: Exactly. That's my usual defense mechanism
for social engagement. Also, once again, our

78
00:04:53,557 --> 00:04:58,348
fantastic charity, 826LA. If you haven't had a
chance, check it out. They do amazing programs for

79
00:04:58,348 --> 00:05:04,023
creative writing for underprivileged kids. If you
have the opportunity to donate, or donate your

80
00:05:04,023 --> 00:05:08,460
time to become one of their fantastic volunteers,
that would be fantastic. Check it out, we love

81
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:13,698
them, and have been supporting them for a long
time. They're amazing. Thank you, 826LA. Or an 826

82
00:05:13,698 --> 00:05:21,497
near your home. I think those are all of the major
announcements.

83
00:05:21,497 --> 00:05:23,587
LAURA: Whoa, that was fast!

84
00:05:23,587 --> 00:05:25,040
MATT: I know, we went through them fast.

85
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,053
LAURA: I didn't even sort my dice yet!

86
00:05:27,053 --> 00:05:39,586
MATT: No new cons or events. So with that, let's
dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

87
00:05:43,786 --> 00:06:54,985
[upbeat music]

88
00:07:01,832 --> 00:07:13,741
MATT: Welcome back. Last we left off, this
intrepid band of slowly converging individual

89
00:07:13,741 --> 00:07:18,501
stories into some semblance of an adventuring
party have found themselves caught up in an

90
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:25,121
investigation. There was a carnival you attended,
which Mollymauk was a part of, that had a terrible

91
00:07:25,121 --> 00:07:32,222
scenario occur. An older man who was at the
carnival had been transformed in the middle of a

92
00:07:32,222 --> 00:07:36,916
performance into some horrible undead creature
that attacked and assaulted other people within

93
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:40,923
the tent. You defeated it and since have all been
under investigation and been told you can't leave

94
00:07:40,923 --> 00:07:45,223
the town. To try and absolve yourselves of any
sort of doubt, you've begun to investigate what

95
00:07:45,223 --> 00:07:51,598
the cause is for this strange transformation.
You've gone around the town asking questions,

96
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:55,852
meeting individuals, eventually finding yourselves
back at the tent in the middle of the night, past

97
00:07:55,852 --> 00:08:00,768
midnight, in the early hours of the morning,
sneaking into tents and asking members of the

98
00:08:00,768 --> 00:08:06,184
carnival what they may know about what has
transpired. Upon speaking with a number of members

99
00:08:06,184 --> 00:08:15,442
of the carnival, two of the guards that were on
site suddenly fell dead where they were standing,

100
00:08:15,442 --> 00:08:21,748
writhing in pain as they passed. You watched as a
large shadow, which you had confirmed being

101
00:08:21,748 --> 00:08:31,820
fiendish in nature, leapt northward towards the
Ustaloch and out of sight as both Fjord and Caleb

102
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:37,296
rushed out of the main tent to see the center of
the camp where these two bodies begin to rise up,

103
00:08:37,296 --> 00:08:42,912
two more of the freshly transformed undead
creatures now angered and looking about for

104
00:08:42,912 --> 00:08:47,753
something to feast upon. And that was where we
left off.

105
00:08:47,811 --> 00:08:49,334
TRAVIS: Totally good.

106
00:08:49,334 --> 00:08:51,023
SAM: No problem with our setup.

107
00:08:51,023 --> 00:08:53,539
LAURA: That was the third spell, by the way.
Detect Good and Evil.

108
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:56,546
MATT: Okay, there you go. So how many spells do
you have left?

109
00:08:56,546 --> 00:09:04,825
LAURA: No spells. I've got cantrips though, so
don't worry, guys.

110
00:09:08,485 --> 00:09:09,615
MATT: Well--

111
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:12,745
TALIESIN: No burger left. Just onion rings.

112
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,608
LAURA: Just the fried piece. Not even an onion
left in there.

113
00:09:16,608 --> 00:09:20,220
MATT: I would like you all to roll initiative,
please.

114
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,794
TRAVIS: Oh, right off the bat?

115
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:23,127
MATT: Yeah!

116
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:25,374
SAM: We're fighting already?

117
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:29,112
MARISHA: Oh, natural 20!

118
00:09:30,092 --> 00:09:31,302
SAM: Nope!

119
00:09:34,122 --> 00:09:37,697
I rolled her dice, it was a one, I'm never
rolling it again.

120
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,419
LAURA: Oh! Yours rolled a one, too.

121
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:42,562
(laughter)

122
00:09:42,562 --> 00:09:46,488
TRAVIS: We rolled low. Level two!

123
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,287
LAURA: Oh no, oh no!

124
00:09:51,996 --> 00:09:55,263
MATT: All righty. 20 to 15.

125
00:09:55,263 --> 00:09:57,803
MARISHA: 24.

126
00:09:57,803 --> 00:10:03,521
MATT: Beau at the top. 15 to 10?

127
00:10:03,521 --> 00:10:06,660
LIAM: Elf. 11.

128
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,126
SAM: Is that German?

129
00:10:08,126 --> 00:10:09,421
LIAM: Ja.

130
00:10:09,553 --> 00:10:10,613
MATT: Ten to five.

131
00:10:10,613 --> 00:10:11,788
SAM: Five.

132
00:10:11,788 --> 00:10:15,398
TALIESIN: Eight. That's a number.

133
00:10:15,398 --> 00:10:18,287
MATT: That it is. You?

134
00:10:18,287 --> 00:10:19,869
TRAVIS: Nope. Three.

135
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,064
LIAM: Three!

136
00:10:22,064 --> 00:10:26,282
LAURA: You have three initiative? What's your
initiative?

137
00:10:26,282 --> 00:10:27,446
LIAM: What's your modifier?

138
00:10:27,446 --> 00:10:28,751
TRAVIS: Zero.

139
00:10:28,751 --> 00:10:30,478
MATT: So. Five.

140
00:10:30,478 --> 00:10:33,740
LIAM: Holy. Shit.

141
00:10:34,642 --> 00:10:40,305
MATT: The good news is they didn't roll very high,
either, but still better than a lot of you. And

142
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:41,903
then three and three?

143
00:10:41,903 --> 00:10:43,305
LAURA: No, I'm four.

144
00:10:43,305 --> 00:10:44,751
MATT: Okay, there we go.

145
00:10:44,751 --> 00:10:46,532
TRAVIS: You're one, right?

146
00:10:46,532 --> 00:10:49,647
SAM: I have five. One plus four.

147
00:10:49,647 --> 00:10:50,919
LIAM: And you're one plus nothing?

148
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:52,268
LAURA: One plus three.

149
00:10:54,688 --> 00:11:05,600
MATT: You watch as these two zombified guards,
their brass-colored scale armor clanking as their

150
00:11:05,863 --> 00:11:13,359
forms rise up, looking around, peer past the
shadowed darkness around the campfire lighting the

151
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:22,147
interior. The horses grow nervous as you watch
both Caleb and Fjord emerge from the tent right in

152
00:11:22,147 --> 00:11:27,118
their sights. You watch as they both 
begin to lumber in your direction.

153
00:11:30,477 --> 00:11:32,986
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch.

154
00:11:32,986 --> 00:11:34,694
SAM: You guys are out in the open?

155
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,427
LAURA: Yeah, they're just sitting there.

156
00:11:36,427 --> 00:11:40,385
LIAM: We just walked out of the tent door and are
looking at that.

157
00:11:40,385 --> 00:11:42,412
TRAVIS: Thank god there's that cart right there.

158
00:11:42,412 --> 00:11:44,275
LIAM: We're safe.

159
00:11:44,275 --> 00:11:47,075
MATT: They come right up to you.

160
00:11:47,075 --> 00:11:49,038
LAURA: They are fast moving zombies!

161
00:11:49,038 --> 00:11:54,590
MATT: Well, that's all it can do. It dashed. It
lurches towards them. They move a little bit

162
00:11:54,590 --> 00:12:00,280
quicker than you'd expect, but not necessarily
that quick. They both spend their full turns

163
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,979
trying to close the gap. For the horses--

164
00:12:04,092 --> 00:12:07,107
LIAM: Is that one five or ten feet away from me?

165
00:12:07,107 --> 00:12:11,231
The horses immediately freak out 
and start running this direction in a gallop.

166
00:12:11,392 --> 00:12:13,287
LIAM: Oh, damn it.

167
00:12:13,287 --> 00:12:14,826
TRAVIS: There goes that idea.

168
00:12:14,826 --> 00:12:16,348
TALIESIN: It was such a good idea.

169
00:12:16,348 --> 00:12:18,976
SAM: The horses have better initiative
than all of us.

170
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:25,412
MATT: That's going to go ahead and end their go.
Beau, you're up.

171
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:36,135
MARISHA: I turn to Jester and Molly. Fucking-- we
probably shouldn't kill crownsguard, even if it's

172
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:38,264
a zombie. Should we go after the toad?

173
00:12:39,797 --> 00:12:44,113
LAURA: We should probably kill the zombies because
anybody that gets bitten by a zombie turns into

174
00:12:44,113 --> 00:12:45,732
another zombie!

175
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:48,148
MARISHA: I don't want to be a guard killer. All
right, fine.

176
00:12:48,148 --> 00:12:50,491
TALIESIN: I don't want to be a fucking zombie.

177
00:12:50,491 --> 00:12:51,864
TRAVIS: We just can't be here.

178
00:12:51,864 --> 00:12:55,994
MARISHA: Can I peek out and see the
guard-zombies?

179
00:12:55,994 --> 00:12:57,739
TALIESIN: They did run by.

180
00:12:57,739 --> 00:13:01,364
MATT: You watch them as you peek under the tent
and they both just ran to the right.

181
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:06,182
MARISHA: Can I crawl out from under the tent and
clear the gap with them and get up to them?

182
00:13:08,082 --> 00:13:09,728
TALIESIN: Oh, fancy.

183
00:13:12,528 --> 00:13:14,665
SAM: Cool map.

184
00:13:14,665 --> 00:13:21,398
MATT: That's as close as you can get right there.
You can go into a dash if you wanted to engage

185
00:13:21,398 --> 00:13:23,337
directly.

186
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,291
MARISHA: Oh, man, I don't know what to do.

187
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,485
TRAVIS: It's all right. Work it out.

188
00:13:34,485 --> 00:13:41,221
MATT: Actually, this is my fault. I rolled for the
zombies to see who they saw first, but technically

189
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:45,574
their turn hadn't come up yet. That's my fault,
because their initiative is lower in the order, so

190
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,280
we're going to retcon a little bit of that. That's
still there.

191
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,115
TRAVIS: (singing) Rewind!

192
00:13:51,115 --> 00:13:59,270
MATT: Because your initiative was super high.
That's totally my bad. It's early enough in the

193
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:02,712
combat where it's not going to make a huge
difference. But you do watch as they turn and they

194
00:14:02,712 --> 00:14:08,911
look past the direction like they're ready to dart
towards the actual large carnival tent.

195
00:14:08,911 --> 00:14:12,938
LAURA: Now I just want to do Hamilton with all our
character voices.

196
00:14:12,938 --> 00:14:21,609
MARISHA: After Jester trying to help me, can I
close the gap to this guy?

197
00:14:21,609 --> 00:14:24,843
MATT: You can at this point, yeah. It's two
squares to get there.

198
00:14:24,843 --> 00:14:26,484
TRAVIS: Look at that mini!

199
00:14:26,484 --> 00:14:29,130
LAURA: Oh, you're out there all by yourself!
Beau!

200
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,378
MARISHA: It's cool, man.

201
00:14:30,378 --> 00:14:31,674
TRAVIS: Cut them down with those guns.

202
00:14:31,674 --> 00:14:34,959
MARISHA: Is that fire still going?

203
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:40,012
MATT: It's not a huge blaze, but there's some
flames in it. It's starting to burn out a little

204
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:40,649
bit.

205
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:43,784
TRAVIS: Both barrels. Six shooter. Give it to
them.

206
00:14:43,784 --> 00:14:52,795
MARISHA: Okay. With my initial attack as I run up,
can I take my staff and try and take them out at

207
00:14:52,795 --> 00:14:55,833
the knees? Just a sweep?

208
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,751
MATT: Sure. I'd say go ahead and make an athletics
check.

209
00:14:58,751 --> 00:14:59,639
TRAVIS: Knock them prone?

210
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:01,521
MARISHA: Yeah, that's what I'm going for.

211
00:15:01,521 --> 00:15:02,905
MATT: Make an athletics check.

212
00:15:02,905 --> 00:15:04,670
TRAVIS: I like that a lot.

213
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,055
MARISHA: That's not great. Nine.

214
00:15:11,287 --> 00:15:13,475
MATT: Rolled a natural 20 on his end.

215
00:15:13,475 --> 00:15:14,822
MARISHA: Shit!

216
00:15:14,822 --> 00:15:18,967
MATT: As you swing with the staff, it slams into
the side of the guard's leg and you hear the

217
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:25,167
slight crack of wood as the armored exterior of
the zombified form seems to stand resolute against

218
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:30,517
the strength of your blow. Its head, which was
turned off angrily towards the shadowed direction

219
00:15:30,517 --> 00:15:37,764
of Caleb and Fjord, turns back, the red burning
coals for eyes now glaring in your direction. What

220
00:15:37,764 --> 00:15:38,902
are you doing?

221
00:15:38,902 --> 00:15:42,550
MARISHA: I look at him and I say, you fucking
broke my stick! I'm going to do an elbow to the

222
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:48,398
face and then another punch with the staff still
in my hand and do Flurry of Blows.

223
00:15:48,398 --> 00:15:53,985
MATT: Well, you did your one attack to sweep him.
It's an unarmed attack for your next two.

224
00:15:53,985 --> 00:15:57,964
MARISHA: Right, I know. I'm doing an elbow and a
punch, I'm just holding my staff.

225
00:15:57,964 --> 00:16:01,210
MATT: Right. Misunderstood. Okay, go for it. Roll
for the attack.

226
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,989
MARISHA: Two attacks, right?

227
00:16:02,989 --> 00:16:04,764
MATT: You got it.

228
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:08,987
MARISHA: Oh god, this makes me so nervous. That's
good! 19 for the first one.

229
00:16:08,987 --> 00:16:10,793
MATT: 19 hits.

230
00:16:10,793 --> 00:16:13,133
MARISHA: Oh, and a natural one for the second.

231
00:16:13,133 --> 00:16:15,046
MATT: You guys with the ones at the start of this
fight!

232
00:16:15,046 --> 00:16:16,803
LAURA: I don't know what's happening!

233
00:16:16,803 --> 00:16:18,499
MATT: Roll damage for the first one.

234
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:20,471
TRAVIS: You can't be too cocky.

235
00:16:20,471 --> 00:16:22,210
MATT: I know, apparently.

236
00:16:23,227 --> 00:16:24,821
MARISHA: Eight?

237
00:16:24,821 --> 00:16:26,462
LAURA: What's new at the table?

238
00:16:26,462 --> 00:16:27,686
TALIESIN: Everything.

239
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:31,717
MATT: Eight points of damage. As you elbow across,
wham! You watch as the jaw hangs and dislodges a

240
00:16:31,717 --> 00:16:37,556
bit, and as its head turns towards you, you reach
with your other first and it catches it in the

241
00:16:37,556 --> 00:16:42,529
middle of the air and it tries to bite at your
arm, but the jaw hangs open, not able to actually

242
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:48,135
find any purchase in your arm. I believe that ends
your turn. Caleb, you're up.

243
00:16:48,135 --> 00:16:56,251
LIAM: I am going to move over a bit towards that
carriage and I pull the diamond out of my

244
00:16:56,251 --> 00:17:02,418
component pouch and a small prismatic ball forms
over it. I take my other hand and spin it really

245
00:17:02,418 --> 00:17:06,597
fast and little ice shards start shooting out of
the side. I take it with the free hand and I'm

246
00:17:06,597 --> 00:17:11,120
going to throw it like a fucking baseball pitcher
at the one closest to Beauregard.

247
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,393
MATT: Right there? Okay. So go ahead and roll your
attack on that.

248
00:17:14,393 --> 00:17:22,435
LIAM: D&D Beyond, where did you go? Oh, that's
good! 23.

249
00:17:22,435 --> 00:17:23,826
MATT: 23 definitely hits.

250
00:17:23,826 --> 00:17:34,017
LIAM: Okay. So that is cold damage. 3d8. Come on!
Nine total.

251
00:17:34,017 --> 00:17:41,546
MATT: Nine points of cold damage to it. You watch
as it's trying to bite with no effect towards

252
00:17:41,546 --> 00:17:46,231
Beau's arm as she's pulling away. The sphere slams
into the side of its shoulder, it would be this

253
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:51,689
side, and it pulls back. You watch as the arm
breaks a bit and the ice shards coalesce around

254
00:17:51,689 --> 00:17:56,692
the outside of the armor and linger with this
frost and mist that sprays off the impact. It

255
00:17:56,692 --> 00:17:59,194
looks fairly damaged.

256
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:04,263
LIAM: Question, am I supposed to roll initiative
for Frumpkin as well?

257
00:18:04,263 --> 00:18:08,473
MATT: Technically by the rules, yes. But it might
be easier to have you guys go at the same time.

258
00:18:08,473 --> 00:18:10,091
LIAM: Okay, if that's what you want to do.

259
00:18:10,091 --> 00:18:12,811
MATT: Sure, for now.

260
00:18:12,811 --> 00:18:15,935
LIAM: I'm sending Frumpkin to zip under that tent.
He has 40 feet of movement.

261
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,530
MATT: This one here?

262
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,471
LIAM: Yeah.

263
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:21,475
MATT: Easy enough. Frumpkin is underneath there.

264
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,397
TRAVIS: What's inside?

265
00:18:23,397 --> 00:18:25,788
MARISHA: What's in the tent?

266
00:18:25,788 --> 00:18:31,587
TRAVIS: (sneezing) Fucking cat.

267
00:18:32,095 --> 00:18:33,171
MATT: That your turn?

268
00:18:33,171 --> 00:18:34,208
LIAM: That's it, ja.

269
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,395
LAURA: This is so cute. Look at all
the little barrels.

270
00:18:36,395 --> 00:18:37,682
MATT: Molly, you're up.

271
00:18:37,689 --> 00:18:43,301
TALIESIN: I'm going to burst out of the tent. Can
I make it to the one that Beau is fighting?

272
00:18:43,301 --> 00:18:46,424
MATT: (counting) You can indeed.

273
00:18:46,424 --> 00:18:50,029
TALIESIN: I'm going to make it to the one that
Beau is fighting and I'm going to take two

274
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:52,949
straight attacks with my scimitar.

275
00:18:52,949 --> 00:18:56,236
MATT: Go for it. You see half of its body encased
in ice now, and it's still lashing out in Beau's

276
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:59,096
direction as you rush up.

277
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,260
TALIESIN: That's a 15 and a natural 20.

278
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,352
MATT: Okay then!

279
00:19:02,352 --> 00:19:04,023
TALIESIN: Without even figuring out, yeah.

280
00:19:04,023 --> 00:19:05,224
LAURA: Fifteen plus whatever.

281
00:19:05,224 --> 00:19:06,759
MATT: Those both hit.

282
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:08,580
TALIESIN: Natural 20 is just double the die,
right?

283
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,512
MATT: Yeah.

284
00:19:09,512 --> 00:19:12,535
TRAVIS: Come on, iron snitch.

285
00:19:12,535 --> 00:19:14,268
LAURA: Make up for our shortcomings, Taliesin!

286
00:19:14,268 --> 00:19:15,582
MATT: Which one's which?

287
00:19:15,582 --> 00:19:24,567
TALIESIN: First one is (counting) 15?

288
00:19:24,567 --> 00:19:25,837
TRAVIS: Yeah, dude.

289
00:19:25,837 --> 00:19:27,716
TALIESIN: No, double, I have to roll two dice,
right?

290
00:19:27,716 --> 00:19:30,441
MATT: The first attack is that die, so that's not
the critical.

291
00:19:30,441 --> 00:19:37,392
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fine. That's nine points of
damage. Then two dice or double the dice?

292
00:19:37,392 --> 00:19:40,531
MATT: We'll just double the die, it's fine. It's
fun to do it that way. Less dice to have to roll.

293
00:19:40,531 --> 00:19:44,424
TALIESIN: That's 13 points of damage.

294
00:19:44,424 --> 00:19:46,634
MATT: 13 points of damage.

295
00:19:46,634 --> 00:19:51,240
MATT: Ha, nope. So you watch as it's slashing at
Beau. The ice explodes in its side and Mollymauk

296
00:19:51,327 --> 00:19:56,413
comes walking out of the tent, both of the
scimitars spinning in his hand like this dervish

297
00:19:56,413 --> 00:20:02,153
entity. As he slams both blades simultaneously
into the sides of this creature, he cuts a v shape

298
00:20:02,153 --> 00:20:08,209
into the upper torso and it slips out of it. The
central portion of its body slips onto the ground

299
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:12,170
with a splat and the arms fall to the side and the
body collapses onto the ground.

300
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,411
TALIESIN: I turn and smile at Beau.

301
00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:16,844
MARISHA: Thanks.

302
00:20:16,844 --> 00:20:19,405
LAURA: You cut like a little v cake with head.

303
00:20:19,405 --> 00:20:27,509
TALIESIN: It's a pizza pie with a pizza slice. I
turn 180 and get ready for the other one.

304
00:20:27,509 --> 00:20:30,884
MARISHA: Doesn't make me trust you any more. Less,
actually.

305
00:20:30,884 --> 00:20:36,157
MATT: Which is now its turn. Having you rush out
of the tent, its attention once in the distance,

306
00:20:36,157 --> 00:20:42,327
it traces you over as you attack its ally. It
lunges over towards you and makes two strikes in

307
00:20:42,327 --> 00:20:43,573
your direction.

308
00:20:43,573 --> 00:20:51,796
TALIESIN: I make eye contact with it and, fuck it,
just for fun I'm going to burn my blood maledict.

309
00:20:51,796 --> 00:20:57,848
There's going to be a blood vessel that pops on my
neck and I'm going to make him cry.

310
00:20:57,848 --> 00:21:00,738
TRAVIS: "I'm just going to make him cry"!

311
00:21:00,738 --> 00:21:06,498
MATT: The bulging red eyes suddenly go black and
thick droplets of blood-like ichor begin to spill

312
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:09,649
out the corners of the zombie's eyes.

313
00:21:09,649 --> 00:21:10,979
TALIESIN: I take three damage.

314
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,188
MATT: Oh are you--

315
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,626
TALIESIN: I'm amplifying.

316
00:21:13,626 --> 00:21:17,175
MATT: You take three damage. This attack and the
next attack he has disadvantage on.

317
00:21:17,354 --> 00:21:20,398
MARISHA: Ooh shit, that's awesome!

318
00:21:20,398 --> 00:21:26,195
MATT: 16 and an eight for the first attack so that
bring it down to a 12 to hit.

319
00:21:26,195 --> 00:21:28,756
TALIESIN: No.

320
00:21:28,756 --> 00:21:33,615
MATT: As it rushes towards you, you can see the
opening as it swings too wide and you duck right

321
00:21:33,615 --> 00:21:39,228
out of the way. Second attack with disadvantage as
well. That's a 19 and a 16, so the 16 plus four

322
00:21:39,228 --> 00:21:40,998
that's 20, so it still hits.

323
00:21:40,998 --> 00:21:42,901
TALIESIN: It still hits. That's fine.

324
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:46,622
MATT: The first one you duck out of the way.
However, the secondary slam hits you for five

325
00:21:46,622 --> 00:21:51,098
points of bludgeoning damage across your shoulder.
You get pushed back into Beau and Beau catches

326
00:21:51,098 --> 00:21:52,703
your fall.

327
00:21:52,703 --> 00:21:54,807
TRAVIS: Not the jacket!

328
00:21:54,807 --> 00:21:56,635
TALIESIN: Ow.

329
00:21:56,635 --> 00:21:59,022
MATT: That ends its go. Nott, you're up.

330
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,091
SAM: It's still alive?

331
00:22:01,091 --> 00:22:02,369
MATT: Yeah.

332
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:12,938
SAM: Nott is going to hard charge out of the tent.
Not at the beast, but across the courtyard. Yes.

333
00:22:12,938 --> 00:22:20,272
As fast as she can go, saying: Shit shit shit! Can
she make it to that box?

334
00:22:20,603 --> 00:22:22,255
MATT: She can't, unfortunately.

335
00:22:22,255 --> 00:22:23,383
SAM: She can't?

336
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:26,648
MATT: No, it's (counting). You can get to right
there.

337
00:22:26,648 --> 00:22:36,535
SAM: As she's running, she's going to fire her
crossbow at the dude. 11 plus six, 17.

338
00:22:36,535 --> 00:22:37,894
MATT: That hits.

339
00:22:38,714 --> 00:22:39,822
ALL: Ooh!

340
00:22:39,822 --> 00:22:42,759
(laughter)

341
00:22:42,947 --> 00:22:44,202
TRAVIS: Wow!

342
00:22:44,202 --> 00:22:49,222
Your dice just ollied off of the side of
your dice tray! If this was Tony Hawk, you would

343
00:22:49,222 --> 00:22:52,546
be accumulating points still, it's racking it up.

344
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,313
LIAM: I've seen this Twilight episode. He knows
what is behind your screen the rest of the game!

345
00:22:56,313 --> 00:22:58,873
MARISHA: Give him the multiplier!

346
00:22:58,873 --> 00:23:00,243
MATT: There you go.

347
00:23:00,243 --> 00:23:04,311
SAM: Okay, so that is seven points of damage and
sneak attack damage?

348
00:23:04,311 --> 00:23:06,390
MATT: Correct, as it is adjacent to Molly.

349
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,722
SAM: Another two points.

350
00:23:07,722 --> 00:23:08,911
MATT: Okay.

351
00:23:08,911 --> 00:23:14,540
SAM: Oh! And why not? I'll use Fury of the Small!
Add another two points.

352
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,630
MATT: That's a full ten points of damage to him.

353
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:21,410
SAM: Yes and then bonus action can I just hide
behind that thing?

354
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,996
MATT: You can't hide behind it because you'd have
to get behind it, but you can use your bonus

355
00:23:23,996 --> 00:23:28,827
action to dash and get behind it. You're not
technically hiding, but you'll move in this direction.

356
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:31,623
LAURA: Oh, that's what rouges can do, they can use
their bonus action to dash?

357
00:23:31,623 --> 00:23:33,135
SAM: Apparently?

358
00:23:33,135 --> 00:23:39,386
MATT: Yep. You get behind. "Oh god!" That finishes
your turn, Nott. That brings us to Jester! You're up!

359
00:23:39,642 --> 00:23:46,539
LAURA: Oh okay! I'm going to sit down on the
ground and open the tent.

360
00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:47,614
MATT: And look out?

361
00:23:47,614 --> 00:23:49,095
LAURA: And look out.

362
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:55,184
MATT: You see this sudden interaction of everyone,
or at least Beau and Molly leaping towards the

363
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,333
standing zombie.

364
00:23:56,333 --> 00:24:00,586
LAURA: Then I say: Oh shit, I shouldn't have used
all those spells earlier. All I have is Sacred

365
00:24:00,586 --> 00:24:08,366
Flame, and I'm going to do that. I'm going to
shoot Sacred Flame and at the same time I'm going

366
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:12,129
to go: Frumpkin, come here, let me pet you!

367
00:24:12,335 --> 00:24:14,115
MATT: All right so Sacred Flame is a saving throw
for the--

368
00:24:14,115 --> 00:24:16,718
LAURA: Yeah, it's a 13 dexterity.

369
00:24:16,718 --> 00:24:20,530
MATT: It actually rolled exactly a 13 with no
modifiers, so it does succeed.

370
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:24,139
LAURA: That doesn't do any damage then?

371
00:24:24,139 --> 00:24:27,160
MATT: Well, what does it say on the spell, is it
half damage or no damage?

372
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,708
LAURA: It just says that's it.

373
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:30,736
MATT: Okay then yeah, sorry.

374
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:37,660
LAURA: Balls! (Coughs) Shit. Frumpkin! Lumpy, come
here.

375
00:24:38,682 --> 00:24:41,109
MATT: Let me double check that.

376
00:24:41,109 --> 00:24:43,329
LAURA: Sorry, guys.

377
00:24:43,496 --> 00:24:46,102
MATT: That finishes Jester's turn. Fjord, you're
up.

378
00:24:46,102 --> 00:24:51,955
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, can I fucking run up past the
cart? Charge into the fray with my 30 speed.

379
00:24:51,955 --> 00:24:53,864
MATT: That's about as close as you can get right
there.

380
00:24:53,864 --> 00:24:59,420
TRAVIS: Can I pull out my falchion? I'll flip it
over so it's pommel up and I will use Eldritch

381
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:03,007
Blast towards the remaining zombie.

382
00:25:03,007 --> 00:25:09,083
MATT: As you hold your arm out in force, the edge
of the pommel glows with this dark, black, purple,

383
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:13,167
crackling energy, and this single bolt of Eldritch
energy fires out in the direction. Roll for the attack.

384
00:25:13,172 --> 00:25:15,601
TRAVIS: That is a 14.

385
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:17,439
MATT: That hits, roll damage.

386
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:19,001
SAM: Travis is using magic.

387
00:25:19,001 --> 00:25:24,976
TRAVIS: I'm telling you, it's all happening you
guys! That is nine points of damage.

388
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:31,417
MATT: Nine points of damage, nice. It hits and the
armor dents inward, to the point where if it was

389
00:25:31,417 --> 00:25:36,249
still a living human, it probably would've caused
some serious internal bleeding or bludgeoning, but

390
00:25:36,249 --> 00:25:40,101
the creature seems relatively unphased by the
impact, other than being pushed onto one foot then

391
00:25:40,101 --> 00:25:43,518
back on its, two-foot weight. That ends your
turn.

392
00:25:43,518 --> 00:25:47,368
TRAVIS: I look around and say we need to drop this
fucker and get the hell out of Dodge.

393
00:25:47,626 --> 00:25:50,920
(laughing)

394
00:25:51,064 --> 00:25:53,599
TALIESIN: There's no way we're going to be
able to take this shit seriously.

395
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:55,391
MATT: Beau, you're up.

396
00:25:55,391 --> 00:26:05,217
MARISHA: Okay, back to the top. I'm going to do
with my two-handed, I'm going to use my

397
00:26:05,217 --> 00:26:08,570
quarterstaff two-handed and come down and try and
crack it over his head.

398
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,806
MATT: All right, you have to move over to him,
though.

399
00:26:10,806 --> 00:26:14,243
MARISHA: Okay, can I step over the dead guy.
Sorry, excuse me.

400
00:26:14,243 --> 00:26:18,443
MATT: You vault off of the corpse of the other
zombie guard and then leap down with your staff

401
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:21,093
towards him, go for it.

402
00:26:22,743 --> 00:26:27,893
MARISHA: Goddamn it, fuck, balls and shit. 13.

403
00:26:27,957 --> 00:26:29,678
MATT: 13 still hits.

404
00:26:29,678 --> 00:26:33,648
MARISHA: Yeah! Fuck yeah!

405
00:26:33,648 --> 00:26:36,608
TRAVIS: If you weren't drinking a sea anemone.

406
00:26:36,608 --> 00:26:40,209
MARISHA: You're so weirded out about it. 11 points
of damage.

407
00:26:40,209 --> 00:26:46,400
MATT: 11 points of damage. Wham! You slam into it
and watch as it (impact). It's starting to look

408
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,378
pretty beat up, but it's still standing.

409
00:26:48,378 --> 00:26:50,916
TRAVIS: Damn, that armor's helping it, huh?

410
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:52,669
MATT: You have a bonus action if you still want
it.

411
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:55,423
MARISHA: I can hit again with my bonus, right? I'm
still trying to figure this out.

412
00:26:55,423 --> 00:26:58,832
MATT: Every turn, as long as you're attacking with
your action, you can bonus attack with you unarmed

413
00:26:58,832 --> 00:27:01,881
strike. Then use a ki point to double attack if
you want.

414
00:27:01,881 --> 00:27:09,622
MARISHA: Right. Learning these combat abilities,
it's weird. Okay. I'm going to be like: Ugh, die!

415
00:27:09,622 --> 00:27:12,918
I'm going to do a big roundhouse kick to his
head.

416
00:27:12,918 --> 00:27:15,187
MATT: Go for it, roll for the attack.

417
00:27:15,187 --> 00:27:16,216
TRAVIS: That's awesome.

418
00:27:16,216 --> 00:27:18,696
MARISHA: That's good, that's a 16!

419
00:27:18,696 --> 00:27:20,506
MATT: 16 hits! Go ahead and roll damage.

420
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:26,245
MARISHA: That's an unarmed strike? Okay, eight
points!

421
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:28,761
MATT: Eight points?!

422
00:27:28,761 --> 00:27:35,591
MARISHA: It's a two, plus-- No, wait! I'm sorry,
six points. I was looking at the wrong thing.

423
00:27:35,591 --> 00:27:39,235
MATT: That's okay. Six points of damage. Whack!
You slam it in the side of the head with a

424
00:27:39,235 --> 00:27:43,613
roundhouse kick and watch as the neck snaps and
the head is stick there like (snarling). It's

425
00:27:43,613 --> 00:27:48,112
trying to snarl, but you can hear the windpipe is
closed off at the angle that it got snapped and

426
00:27:48,112 --> 00:27:51,567
it's making this horrible choking sound.

427
00:27:51,567 --> 00:27:54,154
MARISHA: I go, "Ugh, Molly!"

428
00:27:55,194 --> 00:27:56,434
"Do it!"

429
00:27:56,434 --> 00:27:58,023
MATT: Caleb, your turn.

430
00:27:59,687 --> 00:28:06,924
LIAM: Okay I'm also tapped as well. I'm going to
back up against the tent that we came out of and

431
00:28:06,924 --> 00:28:12,222
with a sinking pit in my stomach, my hand starts
to blacken and flake and fire springs from the

432
00:28:12,222 --> 00:28:15,762
palm and it shoots, and I cast Fire Bolt.

433
00:28:15,762 --> 00:28:18,325
MATT: Roll for the attack.

434
00:28:18,325 --> 00:28:20,051
LAURA: Is that a cantrip?

435
00:28:20,051 --> 00:28:24,302
LIAM: That is a cantrip, yeah. That's good though,
that's 17.

436
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:26,181
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

437
00:28:26,181 --> 00:28:32,251
LIAM: That's 1d10, that's this guy here that I
never used in the last campaign. Oh, that's four.

438
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:39,458
MATT: Four points of damage. All right. The bolt
slams into the side of its head where it was hit

439
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:46,814
by Beau, and actually snaps it back into place.
You watch its eyes lull for a second and it comes

440
00:28:46,814 --> 00:28:49,361
back with renewed undead strength.

441
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:52,146
LAURA: <i>Renewed</i> undead strength?

442
00:28:52,146 --> 00:28:54,423
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Undead strength.

443
00:28:54,423 --> 00:28:58,285
MATT: Renewed in the sense that for a second you
watched the light flicker out but it seems to push

444
00:28:58,285 --> 00:29:01,090
through by the force of the enchantment that holds
it aloft.

445
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:03,717
MARISHA: Beau goes: Who undid my work?

446
00:29:03,717 --> 00:29:05,732
LIAM: I probably have a little bit of movement
left.

447
00:29:05,732 --> 00:29:07,237
MATT: You've got ten feet.

448
00:29:07,237 --> 00:29:13,834
LIAM: I would like to sidle into the tent that I
exited before and disappear. Frumpkin will dart

449
00:29:13,834 --> 00:29:16,279
across behind Molly to the little tent.

450
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:18,426
LAURA: No, don't leave me!

451
00:29:18,426 --> 00:29:21,962
MATT: (Counting) What's the movement on Frumpkin?

452
00:29:21,962 --> 00:29:23,229
LIAM: 40.

453
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:28,137
MATT: All right. That's your turn?

454
00:29:28,146 --> 00:29:29,494
LIAM: Ja, that's it.

455
00:29:29,494 --> 00:29:31,055
MATT: All right. Molly, you're up.

456
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,496
TALIESIN: I'm going to take two more shots, I'm
going to see if I can decapitate--

457
00:29:34,496 --> 00:29:35,921
MATT: Two more shots?

458
00:29:35,921 --> 00:29:37,990
TALIESIN: Oh man! I've got to get out of that
habit.

459
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,884
LAURA: Two more swings?

460
00:29:39,884 --> 00:29:42,117
TALIESIN: Two more swings, see if I can decapitate
it.

461
00:29:42,117 --> 00:29:44,277
LAURA: Two more flourishes.

462
00:29:44,277 --> 00:29:47,062
TALIESIN: That's an eight.

463
00:29:47,062 --> 00:29:48,901
MATT: Eight? Misses.

464
00:29:48,901 --> 00:29:50,455
TALIESIN: But a 16 does not.

465
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,331
MATT: 16 does hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

466
00:29:54,651 --> 00:29:56,769
TALIESIN: That's nine points of damage.

467
00:29:56,777 --> 00:29:59,250
MATT: Nine points of damage.

468
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:04,223
As the blade sinks into its shoulder and you
see it carves in and jams halfway through the

469
00:30:04,223 --> 00:30:11,832
torso, the armor stopping it part way before it
lodges in, and it leans forward. (growling) It's

470
00:30:11,832 --> 00:30:16,258
still standing, and your blade's stuck in the
abdomen.

471
00:30:16,258 --> 00:30:19,152
LAURA: Renewed, undead strength.

472
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:24,577
MATT: All right, that ends your turn, Molly. It's
going to take its first slam, swipe at you. Since

473
00:30:24,577 --> 00:30:29,569
you're immediately in front of it. That's a
natural 20. I'm rolling some good 20s tonight.

474
00:30:29,569 --> 00:30:31,778
TRAVIS: What dice did you use?

475
00:30:31,778 --> 00:30:33,881
MATT: What other dice?
Of course it's the snitch.

476
00:30:33,881 --> 00:30:36,274
TRAVIS: (screaming) No, look what you did!

477
00:30:36,274 --> 00:30:38,425
Come back to bite you in the anus.

478
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:41,677
TALIESIN: This is not looking good.
This is looking very bad.

479
00:30:41,677 --> 00:30:43,648
MATT: 11 points of bludgeoning damage.

480
00:30:43,648 --> 00:30:44,872
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

481
00:30:44,872 --> 00:30:50,101
MATT: It clocks you across the side of
the temple. You're vision goes blurring for a

482
00:30:50,131 --> 00:30:54,135
second. You spit across the ground. You're used to
the sight of your own blood, but now it's across

483
00:30:54,135 --> 00:31:00,135
the grass and dirt at your foot. You start to feel
yourself get a bit woozy. It's going to go ahead

484
00:31:00,135 --> 00:31:04,240
and spin around and strike you with its open claw
with the other arm.

485
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,081
TALIESIN: I swear I thought I could kill it.

486
00:31:06,081 --> 00:31:07,348
MATT: That's going to be a 16 to hit?

487
00:31:07,348 --> 00:31:08,349
TALIESIN: That hits.

488
00:31:08,349 --> 00:31:10,384
SAM: Man down.

489
00:31:10,384 --> 00:31:12,017
TRAVIS: Come on, baby.

490
00:31:12,017 --> 00:31:13,663
MATT: That is nine points of bludgeoning damage.

491
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:14,986
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, I'm out.

492
00:31:14,986 --> 00:31:17,348
TRAVIS: (laughing) Yeah, first one!

493
00:31:17,348 --> 00:31:20,013
MARISHA: Oh shit!
Christ!

494
00:31:20,013 --> 00:31:22,317
TRAVIS: Write the history books.

495
00:31:22,387 --> 00:31:28,663
MATT: You guys watch as the first hit clocks Molly
hard. The second one is this clawing uppercut. He

496
00:31:28,663 --> 00:31:33,840
goes backwards dropping one scimitar; the other
one being left, stuck in the body of the undead

497
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:41,619
guard. As it now glances back towards Beau to
its right. That's the end of Molly's turn, and the

498
00:31:41,647 --> 00:31:43,441
zombie's turn. Nott, you're up.

499
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:45,058
LAURA: Kill it, Nott!

500
00:31:45,058 --> 00:31:46,553
TRAVIS: You didn't fall into the fire, right?

501
00:31:46,553 --> 00:31:48,106
MATT: No, he fell straight back.

502
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:49,664
TRAVIS: Are you sure?

503
00:31:49,664 --> 00:31:51,755
MATT: If he rolled a one, we'd talk.

504
00:31:51,755 --> 00:31:56,471
TALIESIN: I think I'm immune to fire, anyways or
some such thing.

505
00:31:56,471 --> 00:31:57,548
MATT: Fire resistance?

506
00:31:57,548 --> 00:31:58,997
TALIESIN: Yeah, fire resistance.

507
00:31:58,997 --> 00:32:00,848
TRAVIS: Because of your magical, technicolor
dreamcoat?

508
00:32:00,848 --> 00:32:02,674
MATT: Nott, what do you got? You just watched
Molly go down.

509
00:32:02,674 --> 00:32:04,800
TALIESIN: Out, but not dead.

510
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,144
SAM: Seeing one of us die scares the shit out of
me.

511
00:32:08,144 --> 00:32:09,264
MATT: Unconscious.

512
00:32:09,264 --> 00:32:10,806
SAM: No, dead forever.

513
00:32:10,806 --> 00:32:13,260
(laughter)

514
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,756
TALIESIN: I've just started working on a new
character tonight. Thank god.

515
00:32:16,756 --> 00:32:20,921
SAM: I start charging out at the beast.

516
00:32:20,921 --> 00:32:22,992
MATT: All right.

517
00:32:22,992 --> 00:32:29,925
SAM: I get about halfway. I fire my crossbow
(wailing scream).

518
00:32:29,925 --> 00:32:31,485
Fire the crossbow.

519
00:32:31,485 --> 00:32:33,157
TRAVIS: So brave.

520
00:32:33,783 --> 00:32:35,174
SAM: That's a natural 20.

521
00:32:35,174 --> 00:32:37,390
(cheering)

522
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:40,969
LAURA: With sneak attack you double your dice.

523
00:32:40,969 --> 00:32:42,180
MATT: How do you want to do this?

524
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,647
(cheering)

525
00:32:43,647 --> 00:32:45,930
MATT: It doesn't even matter the damage you deal.
If the damage from a critical hit, it doesn't get

526
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,472
its undead fortitude.

527
00:32:47,472 --> 00:32:49,301
(cheering)

528
00:32:49,301 --> 00:33:01,272
SAM: I'm low to the ground so probably in the back
of the calf or something. Before it falls, I'm

529
00:33:01,272 --> 00:33:10,881
going to turn and run into the tent. I don't even
know if I hit. (screaming)

530
00:33:10,881 --> 00:33:12,936
LIAM: That's my girl.

531
00:33:12,936 --> 00:33:18,396
MATT: Molly, as you watch it turn around towards
you, suddenly it lurches as a crossbow bolt

532
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:23,910
shatters its kneecap from behind. Its other leg,
which had been partially damaged from the process

533
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:28,457
of getting up and combat that's happened isn't
enough to keep it aloft. It tumbles back into the

534
00:33:28,457 --> 00:33:34,882
fire and immediately begins to burn as it begins
to scream and squeal. See the flames begin to burn

535
00:33:34,882 --> 00:33:40,046
and engulf its body before eventually it comes to
rest, no longer held by this undead magic that

536
00:33:40,046 --> 00:33:45,372
keeps it standing. Quiet falls over the
encampment.

537
00:33:45,381 --> 00:33:46,825
TRAVIS: Nice.

538
00:33:51,008 --> 00:33:55,099
Molly. Well, next up, as this is now

539
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:57,328
important, Jester it's your turn.

540
00:33:57,328 --> 00:34:06,225
LAURA: I come running out of the tent. Say: Molly!
Oh shit, oh no! Okay. I kneel down next to him and

541
00:34:06,225 --> 00:34:08,519
I'll do Spare the Dying cantrip.

542
00:34:08,738 --> 00:34:09,786
SAM: It's a cantrip?

543
00:34:09,786 --> 00:34:16,168
LAURA: Yes. It took someone going unconscious,
guys.

544
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:20,285
SAM: It's designed for this moment.

545
00:34:20,285 --> 00:34:23,579
MATT: That being the case, you become stable.

546
00:34:23,579 --> 00:34:25,226
TALIESIN: (gasps)

547
00:34:25,226 --> 00:34:29,192
MATT: You're not conscious yet, but you're stable.
You don't have to make--

548
00:34:31,117 --> 00:34:35,490
LAURA: Can I try and do some medicine on him? Does
that heal him at all?

549
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,154
MATT: Do you have a healer's kit?

550
00:34:37,154 --> 00:34:39,296
LAURA: I don't think so.

551
00:34:39,296 --> 00:34:40,975
TRAVIS: She has desserts.

552
00:34:40,975 --> 00:34:46,464
LAURA: I have doughnuts, some paint supplies.

553
00:34:46,464 --> 00:34:53,119
MATT: Beau as you're standing here, Molly is no
longer bleeding out. He's breathing and coughing

554
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:58,560
in the unconsciousness from the pain. You watch as
Jester is fiddling through her bag, pulling things

555
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,785
out.

556
00:34:59,785 --> 00:35:05,461
MARISHA: You have a six pack of donuts, but you
don't have a healer's kit in there? And you're the

557
00:35:05,461 --> 00:35:07,612
cleric? I'm confused.

558
00:35:07,612 --> 00:35:15,329
LAURA: I'm <i>the</i> cleric? What is this? I've never
traveled with a bunch of people that I thought

559
00:35:15,329 --> 00:35:20,589
would die in front of me, okay? I never needed a
healer's kit before.

560
00:35:20,589 --> 00:35:23,861
MARISHA: Well, congratulations, you're the cleric
now.

561
00:35:23,861 --> 00:35:27,047
LAURA: (gasps) You have a healer's kit? Oh my
gosh. I've always wanted one of these for so

562
00:35:27,047 --> 00:35:28,007
long.

563
00:35:28,007 --> 00:35:32,249
MARISHA: I'll give it to her. Here, it's a gift.
Congratulations-on-you-being-in-a-new group gift.

564
00:35:35,249 --> 00:35:39,029
LAURA: Yes! How do I use this, though?

565
00:35:39,102 --> 00:35:41,883
SAM: Oh no, she's not proficient.

566
00:35:41,883 --> 00:35:45,106
LAURA: I open it and rummage through a bunch of
shit here.

567
00:35:45,106 --> 00:35:47,629
TRAVIS: No vanilla extract or sprinkles?

568
00:35:47,629 --> 00:35:53,147
MATT: I'll say for the instance of this, since
it's not necessarily immediate danger of him dying

569
00:35:53,147 --> 00:35:56,855
off. Go ahead and make a medicine check.

570
00:35:57,829 --> 00:35:59,501
SAM: Use my dice that I gave you.

571
00:35:59,501 --> 00:36:00,545
LAURA: Should I?

572
00:36:00,545 --> 00:36:01,529
SAM: Yes.

573
00:36:01,529 --> 00:36:02,956
LAURA: What if I roll a one on it?

574
00:36:02,956 --> 00:36:04,697
SAM: That's what I'm hoping for.

575
00:36:04,697 --> 00:36:07,308
SAM: That's a strong four.

576
00:36:07,308 --> 00:36:09,228
LAURA: A nine?

577
00:36:09,228 --> 00:36:17,720
MATT: Okay, I'll say-- (sighs). He's still
unconscious. Given a little bit of time, he'll

578
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:23,751
come back to consciousness. Ten minutes or so. You
can probably, eventually through the use of strong

579
00:36:23,751 --> 00:36:32,508
vapors or something you can bring him back from
the brink. At this point the rest of the carnival

580
00:36:32,508 --> 00:36:37,493
currently within the vicinity begin to emerge from
the tents seeing that the danger has passed.

581
00:36:37,493 --> 00:36:40,405
SAM: Is there any young girl in the tent with me?

582
00:36:40,405 --> 00:36:42,605
MATT: Make a perception check.

583
00:36:44,018 --> 00:36:45,837
SAM: Natural 20.

584
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:50,904
MATT: You glance around the interior of the
chamber which has a unique smell to the inside.

585
00:36:50,904 --> 00:36:56,222
You smelled it before, but it catches you very
strongly now that there's quiet and you're not

586
00:36:56,222 --> 00:37:02,980
focused on anything else. A very faint smell of
brimstone lingers within the tent, mingling with

587
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:08,199
the wet grass. You look around and see no girl.

588
00:37:08,884 --> 00:37:12,480
LIAM: What does happen is Frumpkin scrabbles up
your back and comes to your shoulder, and I'm

589
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,567
watching everything from my hidey hole.

590
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:19,599
MARISHA: I immediately drop down and start
searching the guard.

591
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:25,596
LAURA: Yeah, is any of their armor still usable?
Because we can pretend we're guards for some

592
00:37:25,596 --> 00:37:27,117
reason.

593
00:37:27,117 --> 00:37:36,007
MATT: The one that he cleaved, the armor is not
functional at all. The other one, the last one to

594
00:37:36,007 --> 00:37:40,587
die, the armor is still functional. It is dented
and beat up, but it's still functional. There's

595
00:37:40,587 --> 00:37:47,570
the slightly tarnished brass armor. Then there's
the red maroon color. It's like a scale mail

596
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:53,621
chestplate and armplates for it. It could be used
but it's still a big piece of armor. You'd have to

597
00:37:53,621 --> 00:37:55,807
lug it around or wear it.

598
00:37:55,807 --> 00:37:57,812
TRAVIS: We still look like Crownsguard.

599
00:37:57,812 --> 00:37:58,984
LAURA: Oh.

600
00:37:58,984 --> 00:38:01,289
MATT: You both do, currently.

601
00:38:01,289 --> 00:38:03,261
TRAVIS: Caleb and I.

602
00:38:03,261 --> 00:38:05,245
LIAM: We probably have a half hour at this point?

603
00:38:05,245 --> 00:38:06,994
MATT: About, yeah.

604
00:38:06,994 --> 00:38:10,116
LAURA: We should get out of here soon though
because guards could be coming.

605
00:38:10,116 --> 00:38:13,204
TRAVIS: Did anybody see what happened or where
that hellish toad went?

606
00:38:13,204 --> 00:38:15,094
LAURA: It jumped off that way.

607
00:38:15,094 --> 00:38:15,962
TRAVIS: You saw it?

608
00:38:15,962 --> 00:38:17,202
LAURA: Yeah.

609
00:38:17,202 --> 00:38:24,460
MATT: The Knot twins emerge like, "Where are the
guards, the rest of them? Are more coming or is

610
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,070
this all of them?"

611
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,377
LAURA: There's probably more coming, I would
think.

612
00:38:28,377 --> 00:38:29,845
TRAVIS: We can't be here.

613
00:38:29,845 --> 00:38:31,328
MATT: "Do you think we should run?"

614
00:38:31,328 --> 00:38:33,005
MARISHA: We should hide the evidence.

615
00:38:33,005 --> 00:38:34,723
TRAVIS: What? Where?

616
00:38:34,723 --> 00:38:36,759
MARISHA: I don't know.

617
00:38:36,759 --> 00:38:40,209
LAURA: I don't know who should run where.

618
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:42,729
TALIESIN: (groans)

619
00:38:42,729 --> 00:38:48,153
LAURA: I have his head in my lap and I'm slapping
his cheek consistently.

620
00:38:48,153 --> 00:38:50,440
MARISHA: Was there nothing useful on the guard?

621
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,803
MATT: As you continue to search through, aside
from the armor that seems functional, each of them

622
00:38:54,803 --> 00:38:56,706
have a basic longsword.

623
00:38:56,706 --> 00:39:00,169
TALIESIN: One of them has my sword embedded in
their chest.

624
00:39:00,317 --> 00:39:07,321
MATT: Yes. Which can be pulled out. Between the
two of them you can gather about six gold pieces

625
00:39:07,321 --> 00:39:09,686
and four silver pieces.

626
00:39:09,686 --> 00:39:11,203
LAURA: Ooh!

627
00:39:11,203 --> 00:39:15,532
TRAVIS: I don't want to get these folk in any more
trouble. How far is it from here to the lake?

628
00:39:15,532 --> 00:39:20,514
MATT: Glancing off to the side you can see the
lake is maybe 400 to 500 feet north.

629
00:39:20,514 --> 00:39:24,909
TRAVIS: I say we could drag them and throw them
into the lake to avoid suspicion on the carnival.

630
00:39:24,909 --> 00:39:26,671
We've got to get out of here.

631
00:39:26,671 --> 00:39:30,198
MARISHA: How well did the fire burn the other
body? Did it do pretty well or--

632
00:39:30,198 --> 00:39:39,126
MATT: It's pretty burned. The maroon robes on the
one armor is damaged and can possibly be salvaged.

633
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:44,382
The armor on the one that is burned can be used.
The robes or the maroon cloth is burned away

634
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:49,730
entirely. The armor looks like its been burned. It
has blackened, charcoal edges to it.

635
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:55,838
LIAM: Nott, you feel Frumpkin's claws slowly and
deliberately squeeze into your shoulder.

636
00:39:55,838 --> 00:39:58,424
SAM: That means I have to go.

637
00:39:58,424 --> 00:40:00,518
TRAVIS: Where's Caleb?

638
00:40:00,518 --> 00:40:03,130
MARISHA: I thought he was with you.

639
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:06,004
TRAVIS: He was. I look around for Caleb.

640
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:13,475
MATT: Okay. If you're right there, you're not far
from the tent. You head back and see he's not on

641
00:40:13,475 --> 00:40:16,230
the outside of the tent.

642
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:25,244
SAM: The smell of sulfur, I mean brimstone, do I
figure that it's probably the residual from the

643
00:40:25,244 --> 00:40:29,337
big toad guy or is there a substance in the room
that is causing it?

644
00:40:29,337 --> 00:40:31,899
MATT: Make a religion check.

645
00:40:32,236 --> 00:40:35,280
SAM: A religion check? One.

646
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,796
(laughter)

647
00:40:37,796 --> 00:40:41,705
MATT: You believe the little girl may have tooted
before where she went to where she is.

648
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:43,638
TRAVIS: That's a devastating toot.

649
00:40:43,638 --> 00:40:50,910
SAM: I'm going to try and get out of the tent
through the side. Like underneath the side and

650
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:55,276
towards the horse. Yeah, back there. Looking for
Caleb.

651
00:40:55,276 --> 00:41:01,438
MATT: You glance over and you don't see Caleb. You
do see Fjord is in the process of looking in the

652
00:41:01,438 --> 00:41:06,266
area. You walk up and Caleb is nowhere near the
tent on the outside. You don't know where he is.

653
00:41:06,266 --> 00:41:08,708
TRAVIS: Nott, have you seen Caleb?

654
00:41:08,708 --> 00:41:13,028
SAM: No, not yet. Is he okay? Did he live? Did
everyone live?

655
00:41:13,028 --> 00:41:15,279
TRAVIS: You got his little cat right there on your
shoulder.

656
00:41:15,279 --> 00:41:18,895
SAM: Oh yes I do, hi. Yeah, so he can't be far.

657
00:41:18,895 --> 00:41:21,875
TRAVIS: We need to get out of here. We need to
follow after that toad.

658
00:41:21,875 --> 00:41:26,070
SAM: Okay. There's horses around here, let's steal
them.

659
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:28,939
TRAVIS: That's actually not a terrible idea.

660
00:41:28,939 --> 00:41:35,195
LAURA: Ooh good, we can put Molly on the back of
the wagon. That way we can get him out of here.

661
00:41:35,195 --> 00:41:41,347
And the guards' bodies, too! That way we can drop
them off away from the carnival and people won't

662
00:41:41,347 --> 00:41:42,683
think it's related.

663
00:41:42,683 --> 00:41:44,658
MARISHA: Oh my god, you are so speaking my
language.

664
00:41:44,658 --> 00:41:46,392
LAURA: I'm a very wise person.

665
00:41:46,392 --> 00:41:48,510
TRAVIS: That's a great idea. Let's do that.

666
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,459
LAURA: Okay.

667
00:41:49,699 --> 00:41:53,537
TRAVIS: Who wants to help me with the one totally
charred body?

668
00:41:53,537 --> 00:41:56,642
LAURA: I'll do it. I go pick him up and carry
him.

669
00:41:56,642 --> 00:42:01,978
MATT: An impressive display of physical strength.
The little, adorable tiefling, without an issue

670
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:06,934
lifts the body out of the charred bits of burnt
wood and charcoal.

671
00:42:06,934 --> 00:42:09,148
TRAVIS: Shit. Never would have known.

672
00:42:09,148 --> 00:42:13,009
MARISHA: I grab the other body and start dragging
it or at least its torso.

673
00:42:13,009 --> 00:42:14,560
TRAVIS: I'll help you.

674
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:20,414
MATT: Ornna gives a hand and helps you. The Knot
sisters look like they want to be absolved of this

675
00:42:20,414 --> 00:42:23,895
whole scenario and look like they're about to flee
at any moment.

676
00:42:23,895 --> 00:42:29,481
SAM: Might I point out real quick, up to this
point we are fugitives who haven't committed a

677
00:42:29,481 --> 00:42:36,368
crime. But starting now we will be fugitives who
have committed crimes. Are we sure we want to do this?

678
00:42:36,571 --> 00:42:41,695
TRAVIS: I mean it's either that or leave the
carnival and take the fall for what is two dead

679
00:42:41,695 --> 00:42:43,424
crownsguard.

680
00:42:43,424 --> 00:42:47,093
SAM: All right, let's go. But I have to find Caleb
first.

681
00:42:47,093 --> 00:42:50,975
LIAM: Caleb gets over it and he comes out and
starts helping push the bodies onto the-- doesn't

682
00:42:50,975 --> 00:42:54,121
say anything, but starts pushing bodies onto the
back of the cart.

683
00:42:54,121 --> 00:42:55,538
TRAVIS: Where'd you go?

684
00:42:55,538 --> 00:43:03,373
LIAM: This is not my thing. I am not brave like
Nott. Let's get out of here, please.

685
00:43:03,373 --> 00:43:07,123
TRAVIS: You shot shit out of your hands. I don't
think you were not brave. That was really

686
00:43:07,123 --> 00:43:08,278
impressive.

687
00:43:08,278 --> 00:43:10,172
MARISHA: Wait, you were shooting shit out of your
hands?

688
00:43:10,172 --> 00:43:12,437
TRAVIS: It was fire. It's a figure of fucking
speech.

689
00:43:12,437 --> 00:43:14,072
MARISHA: Oh.

690
00:43:14,072 --> 00:43:18,004
LIAM: I haven't learned that one yet. Some day.

691
00:43:18,289 --> 00:43:21,717
LAURA: Somebody needs to grab Molly. He's still
over there.

692
00:43:21,717 --> 00:43:27,070
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay. We go back over there and we
fucking grab Molly. I grab him by his horns.

693
00:43:27,214 --> 00:43:30,205
MATT: As you're dragging Molly, Molly, your eyes
lull open and you're at one hit point. Come to

694
00:43:30,205 --> 00:43:31,126
consciousness.

695
00:43:31,126 --> 00:43:32,514
TALIESIN: I'm at one hit point?

696
00:43:32,514 --> 00:43:34,547
MATT: You're being dragged.

697
00:43:34,547 --> 00:43:38,147
MARISHA: I start hooking up the horses.

698
00:43:38,147 --> 00:43:41,345
MATT: Okay. You're hooking them all up to?

699
00:43:41,345 --> 00:43:45,599
MARISHA: Yeah, one is going to hook up to the
wagon and I'll-- which wagon do we want to take?

700
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:49,087
LAURA: The one with the two horses attached, yo.
Can you see it?

701
00:43:49,087 --> 00:43:50,009
MARISHA: Yeah.

702
00:43:50,009 --> 00:43:51,532
LAURA: We'll take that one.

703
00:43:51,532 --> 00:43:52,386
MARISHA: Okay.

704
00:43:52,386 --> 00:43:54,206
LAURA: Unhook the other horse so we can steal that
one, too.

705
00:43:54,206 --> 00:44:03,846
MATT: As you guys are doing this, the two Knot
sisters talking to each other, look around, and

706
00:44:03,846 --> 00:44:06,502
they go running to the southeast.

707
00:44:06,502 --> 00:44:07,733
LAURA: They're outies.

708
00:44:07,733 --> 00:44:08,964
MATT: They're out.

709
00:44:08,964 --> 00:44:10,456
SAM: Should I shoot them?

710
00:44:10,496 --> 00:44:12,155
TALIESIN: They're okay.

711
00:44:12,155 --> 00:44:18,974
TRAVIS: Is that single horse a mustang?

712
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,706
LAURA: Oh my god.

713
00:44:20,706 --> 00:44:21,947
TALIESIN: Really?

714
00:44:21,947 --> 00:44:25,112
TRAVIS: What? Can I ask a simple question?

715
00:44:25,112 --> 00:44:29,313
MARISHA: We better get $100,000 from Ford for that
one. We better fucking get that.

716
00:44:29,313 --> 00:44:30,154
MATT: Sure.

717
00:44:30,154 --> 00:44:31,805
TRAVIS: It's not a mare? I'm just checking.

718
00:44:31,805 --> 00:44:33,077
MATT: No, no it is.

719
00:44:33,077 --> 00:44:35,293
TRAVIS: I'm just very curious as to the sex of the horse,
that's all.

720
00:44:35,293 --> 00:44:38,570
MATT: Roll a perception check.

721
00:44:41,515 --> 00:44:43,611
TRAVIS: 12. No, 14.

722
00:44:43,611 --> 00:44:44,969
MATT: That is a mustang.

723
00:44:44,969 --> 00:44:48,617
LIAM: Is its name Roy?

724
00:44:48,617 --> 00:44:50,811
SAM: The white one?

725
00:44:50,811 --> 00:44:51,996
TRAVIS: Yeah.

726
00:44:51,996 --> 00:44:53,663
TALIESIN: Are you going to name it Sally?

727
00:44:53,663 --> 00:44:54,994
TRAVIS: You'll find out.

728
00:44:54,994 --> 00:44:56,811
(laughter)

729
00:44:56,811 --> 00:44:58,692
TALIESIN: I had that coming.

730
00:44:58,692 --> 00:45:03,568
LIAM: During all the busywork, I'm not saying
anything, but I keep giving worried and stressed

731
00:45:03,568 --> 00:45:06,037
glances at my little friend.

732
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:09,209
LAURA: Don't worry, Caleb, I'm okay.

733
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:15,409
MATT: You guys have the bodies loaded up, both the
charred and the slashed one, onto the cart.

734
00:45:15,409 --> 00:45:21,336
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull my sword back out and
start trying to get the horses going.

735
00:45:21,336 --> 00:45:24,382
LAURA: He's alive! You're awake!

736
00:45:24,382 --> 00:45:25,748
TALIESIN: That really hurt.

737
00:45:25,748 --> 00:45:26,870
LAURA: How do you feel?

738
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:28,594
TALIESIN: I feel terrible.

739
00:45:28,594 --> 00:45:33,402
LAURA: I saved your life. You should be really
grateful.

740
00:45:33,975 --> 00:45:37,207
TALIESIN: I can do that. I can do that.

741
00:45:37,207 --> 00:45:41,985
MARISHA: Molly, I appreciate you trying to rally
the horses right now, but I really think you

742
00:45:41,985 --> 00:45:42,939
should rest.

743
00:45:42,939 --> 00:45:46,439
TALIESIN: No, I'm fine. I'm going to actually fall
back into the cart.

744
00:45:46,439 --> 00:45:49,527
MARISHA: I take the reins.

745
00:45:49,527 --> 00:45:55,304
MATT: All right. Easy enough to find any sort of
material if you wanted to cover the contents of

746
00:45:55,304 --> 00:46:08,472
the cart. You guys are ready to go. Ornna is
standing there alone. "I think I should stay here."

747
00:46:08,744 --> 00:46:11,433
LAURA: Are you sure?

748
00:46:11,433 --> 00:46:16,066
MATT: "What, and be a fugitive? I can explain what
happened. Hopefully."

749
00:46:16,066 --> 00:46:18,585
LAURA: What are you going to say to them?

750
00:46:18,585 --> 00:46:27,498
MATT: "Exactly what happened. The same thing that
turned these guards ran off and you're hoping to

751
00:46:27,498 --> 00:46:29,523
stop it."

752
00:46:29,523 --> 00:46:38,469
LAURA: Don't say that we were here. Don't mention
we were here. That's pretty important, I think.

753
00:46:38,469 --> 00:46:39,416
Yeah?

754
00:46:39,416 --> 00:46:46,384
TRAVIS: You couldn't see us in the low light, but
they chased after whatever caused this.

755
00:46:46,384 --> 00:46:51,770
MATT: "Okay. I can do that. I can't leave Gustav
and Bosun in prison to take the fall for this."

756
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:54,746
LAURA: We'll get them out of it.

757
00:46:54,746 --> 00:47:03,046
LIAM: Would you have the abilities to burn these
things up the way we did? Are you capable? Could

758
00:47:03,046 --> 00:47:06,806
you have killed these things? Is that believable
for people who know you?

759
00:47:06,806 --> 00:47:12,290
MATT: "I'm quite good with fire. That's not
entirely impossible."

760
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:20,805
MARISHA: Ornna, is there anything else that you
can think of that could possibly help us? Like why

761
00:47:20,805 --> 00:47:32,770
this toad decided to freak out right now? Anything
that comes to mind before we go chase after your

762
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:33,605
mess.

763
00:47:33,605 --> 00:47:36,274
TRAVIS: Any previous episodes of this kind?

764
00:47:36,274 --> 00:47:46,281
MATT: "No. Never trusted anything that looked the
way Kylre did. Everyone seemed to put a lot of

765
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:54,158
trust in him. Gustav did. Toya did. I don't know
if this is still a misunderstanding, but--" She

766
00:47:54,158 --> 00:48:00,143
points over to where there's splatters of blood in
the middle of the grass. The leftover carnage from

767
00:48:00,143 --> 00:48:07,921
the battle. "Just get this figured out, please.
This is all I have left." She looks around the

768
00:48:07,921 --> 00:48:13,034
empty encampment. She stands amongst the four
empty tents by herself.

769
00:48:14,378 --> 00:48:15,514
SAM: Toya's gone, right?

770
00:48:15,514 --> 00:48:16,596
MATT: Toya's gone.

771
00:48:16,596 --> 00:48:19,544
LAURA: What happened to her? Did it take Toya with
it?

772
00:48:19,544 --> 00:48:21,632
LIAM: Yeah, she frogged out.

773
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:25,384
TRAVIS: We'll try and find some evidence that will
exonerate you and we'll return.

774
00:48:25,384 --> 00:48:28,488
LAURA: We need to find evidence to exonerate us.

775
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:33,007
SAM: Sorry that we thought that you did it.
Briefly.

776
00:48:33,007 --> 00:48:41,633
MATT: "It's okay. It's hard for some folks to
trust carnival folk. Just as hard as it is for

777
00:48:41,633 --> 00:48:45,524
some folks to trust little green folk."

778
00:48:45,524 --> 00:48:48,426
(laughter)

779
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:51,614
TRAVIS: We should really get to stepping.

780
00:48:51,658 --> 00:48:53,117
LAURA: Let's go.

781
00:48:53,117 --> 00:48:54,867
SAM: Saddle up.

782
00:48:54,867 --> 00:48:56,539
TRAVIS: Sure.

783
00:48:56,539 --> 00:48:58,651
MATT: You hop on your mustang.

784
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:00,940
TRAVIS: I do. Shelby.

785
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,774
MARISHA: Oh, god!

786
00:49:02,774 --> 00:49:07,704
TRAVIS: Just deliver it to the PO Box, that's
fine.

787
00:49:07,704 --> 00:49:14,552
TALIESIN: Everything that you've been holding back
for years now is going to come pouring out of you.

788
00:49:14,552 --> 00:49:15,909
Okay.

789
00:49:15,909 --> 00:49:21,073
MATT: You have the cart and the horses at your
disposal. What are you guys doing?

790
00:49:21,073 --> 00:49:24,546
TALIESIN: Trying to take as much of a short rest
as I can back there. I'm going to try and sleep

791
00:49:24,546 --> 00:49:27,612
this off like a bad hangover.

792
00:49:27,612 --> 00:49:32,009
LIAM: I will attempt to do the same to do arcane
recovery.

793
00:49:32,009 --> 00:49:36,166
MATT: Okay. The two of you saddle up on the back
of the cart as it makes its way northward.

794
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:38,385
SAM: Where are we going?

795
00:49:38,385 --> 00:49:40,940
TRAVIS: In the direction the toad leapt.

796
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:46,410
LAURA: Are we really chasing the toad right now?
Molly obviously did the most damage out of anyone

797
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:48,768
and he's almost dead right now.

798
00:49:48,768 --> 00:49:53,112
MARISHA: Maybe we can at least find him, stake him
out, and then we'll rest.

799
00:49:53,112 --> 00:50:00,725
LAURA: We are going to rest, right? We can't just
chase after a toad. We'll die.

800
00:50:00,725 --> 00:50:03,247
TRAVIS: We might need to play it by ear.

801
00:50:03,247 --> 00:50:07,913
LAURA: Fjord, I'm trusting you.

802
00:50:07,913 --> 00:50:12,957
TRAVIS: If it's too dangerous, we'll stand down.
How about that?

803
00:50:12,957 --> 00:50:14,048
LAURA: Okay.

804
00:50:14,048 --> 00:50:16,061
LIAM: Also I have a cat.

805
00:50:16,061 --> 00:50:18,110
LAURA: Yeah, it's cute.

806
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:25,498
LIAM: That's not what I mean. If we catch up to
them, my cat can follow and I can watch.

807
00:50:25,498 --> 00:50:29,372
TRAVIS: Yeah, you blanked out there for a second.

808
00:50:29,372 --> 00:50:36,510
LIAM: If we find them, then we assign Frumpkin to
the case and I will lean against a tree. Nott will

809
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:39,697
keep watch over me and we will know where it
goes.

810
00:50:39,697 --> 00:50:42,419
SAM: We're going with them, then?

811
00:50:42,419 --> 00:50:46,332
LAURA: Yeah, let's follow the direction that the
toad went.

812
00:50:46,332 --> 00:50:48,689
TRAVIS: Yeah.

813
00:50:48,689 --> 00:50:50,413
MARISHA: Cats love toads.

814
00:50:50,413 --> 00:50:58,209
LAURA: I like it. It's a good plan. This is
definitely not going to backfire. Let's go.

815
00:50:58,209 --> 00:51:00,324
(laughter)

816
00:51:00,324 --> 00:51:06,132
MATT: All right. The horses pick up and begin
heading northward towards the Ustaloch.

817
00:51:06,132 --> 00:51:15,992
LAURA: When we get far away from the carnival, we
should drop the guard bodies off. Push them out so

818
00:51:15,992 --> 00:51:22,451
it looks like they were on patrol when they turned
into zombies. Far away from the carnival.

819
00:51:22,451 --> 00:51:25,901
MARISHA: We ran into those guards that were
patrolling the lake--

820
00:51:25,901 --> 00:51:28,661
LAURA: Exactly! Like a lake patrol.

821
00:51:28,661 --> 00:51:37,228
MATT: It doesn't take you too long to get to the
southern edge of the Ustaloch. You can see the

822
00:51:37,228 --> 00:51:43,746
muddy lake bed that gives way to the water itself.
Number of scattered stones in the muck and

823
00:51:43,746 --> 00:51:49,342
occasionally you hear the lapping of waves. The
very subtle wind flowing through in the night.

824
00:51:49,342 --> 00:51:57,357
It's about two in the morning. There's some
moonlight in the sky. It looks like a waxing moon.

825
00:51:57,357 --> 00:52:00,753
At least the one you can see because there are
multiple moons.

826
00:52:00,753 --> 00:52:02,078
SAM: Wait, what?

827
00:52:02,078 --> 00:52:04,182
MATT: There's two moons in Exandria.

828
00:52:04,182 --> 00:52:05,742
SAM: How did we never know that?

829
00:52:05,742 --> 00:52:07,815
MATT: That was established in the last campaign.

830
00:52:07,815 --> 00:52:10,485
TALIESIN: Like dogs, we never looked up.

831
00:52:12,445 --> 00:52:15,146
MATT: One of the moons is so faint--

832
00:52:15,146 --> 00:52:16,616
SAM: How many suns are there?

833
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:27,126
MATT: There's one. Anyway, there's a faint bit of
moonlight which gives you folks without darkvision

834
00:52:27,126 --> 00:52:34,688
a little bit of detail that you can make out in
the vicinity. You come to the lake edge and

835
00:52:34,688 --> 00:52:36,393
there's the water.

836
00:52:36,952 --> 00:52:39,082
TRAVIS: This is the best we can do for them.

837
00:52:39,082 --> 00:52:42,004
LAURA: Take them out of this wagon!

838
00:52:42,004 --> 00:52:46,189
MARISHA: Hang on, hang on. I want to look around.
Do I see any guards?

839
00:52:46,189 --> 00:52:47,797
MATT: Perception check.

840
00:52:48,873 --> 00:52:51,765
MARISHA: Big dice, don't fail! Natural 20!

841
00:52:51,765 --> 00:52:58,279
MATT: Okay. Couple things. One: you don't see any
guards, but you do see a few hundred feet to the

842
00:52:58,279 --> 00:53:05,542
west of you along the edge, you see a boat that is
about a hundred feet out on the water. You see two

843
00:53:05,542 --> 00:53:11,386
figures that are in the boat. Possibly two
fishermen or two guards, but you can't really tell

844
00:53:11,386 --> 00:53:15,109
from this distance. There are two figures in a boat
a little ways out on the water.

845
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:21,535
From your current visual
perspective, you don't see the other end of the

846
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:28,879
lake. It's a pretty decent sized lake, but you can
see the very faint bump of a landmass that breaks

847
00:53:28,879 --> 00:53:30,536
the horizon of the water.

848
00:53:30,536 --> 00:53:31,759
MARISHA: Like an island?

849
00:53:31,759 --> 00:53:33,357
MATT: Like an island, possibly.

850
00:53:33,357 --> 00:53:37,677
LAURA: Or a giant toad sitting in the water?

851
00:53:37,677 --> 00:53:40,073
TALIESIN: That would be a very big toad.

852
00:53:40,073 --> 00:53:42,989
MARISHA: It's far away on the horizon, the little
bump?

853
00:53:42,989 --> 00:53:47,486
MATT: Yeah, it breaks the water's horizon from
here.

854
00:53:47,486 --> 00:53:50,500
MARISHA: There's two figures on a boat about a
hundred yards out.

855
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,096
LAURA: Can they see us?

856
00:53:52,096 --> 00:53:57,112
MARISHA: I don't know. It's hard to say. Do they
seem distracted? Can I make anything else out?

857
00:53:57,112 --> 00:53:59,239
TRAVIS: Lamplight on the boat?

858
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:03,059
MATT: There's a faint bit of lantern light that's
the only reason you're able to make them out at

859
00:54:03,059 --> 00:54:07,039
this distance, but that's as much detail as you
can make out. They're a few hundred feet away from

860
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:07,786
you.

861
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:12,033
LAURA: If we can't see them very clearly, they
can't see us very clearly. We don't have a light

862
00:54:12,033 --> 00:54:13,519
on us.

863
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:16,616
TRAVIS: We're going to have to ditch this wagon
anyway because we've got tracks.

864
00:54:16,616 --> 00:54:20,654
SAM: Just change the license plate. No?

865
00:54:20,654 --> 00:54:23,614
TRAVIS: Vanity plate? What does it say?

866
00:54:23,614 --> 00:54:25,652
SAM: "Back in time"?

867
00:54:25,652 --> 00:54:27,950
(laughter)

868
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,870
MATT: Oh, man.

869
00:54:34,075 --> 00:54:35,688
So, what do you do?

870
00:54:37,069 --> 00:54:41,528
LAURA: Go up a little further away from the boat
and then dump the bodies.

871
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:44,216
SAM: It's really shallow. Shouldn't we weigh them
down with something?

872
00:54:44,216 --> 00:54:51,164
LAURA: It's not like we're trying to hide the
bodies. We're saying they turned into zombies

873
00:54:51,164 --> 00:54:54,143
around here. Is that stupid?

874
00:54:54,143 --> 00:54:56,414
TRAVIS: No, they don't have to go in the water,
right? They're burned. It's not like they burned

875
00:54:56,414 --> 00:54:58,452
in the water.

876
00:54:58,452 --> 00:54:59,970
MATT: That would be very confusing.

877
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:01,396
TRAVIS: It would.

878
00:55:01,396 --> 00:55:03,956
TALIESIN: The wagon tracks directly to the point
at which they are found.

879
00:55:03,956 --> 00:55:05,774
TRAVIS: That's what I just said.

880
00:55:05,774 --> 00:55:08,031
LAURA: Oh, coming from the carnival.

881
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:10,021
TRAVIS: I wish I had something that could
help Molly out.

882
00:55:11,521 --> 00:55:14,829
SAM: We could write a little note and put it in
one of their pockets that says something like

883
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:21,246
"I've discovered that Caleb and Nott are innocent
and should be cleared of all charges", or

884
00:55:21,246 --> 00:55:22,684
something like that.

885
00:55:22,684 --> 00:55:26,445
LAURA: That would definitely work. Will you add my
name to that list?

886
00:55:26,445 --> 00:55:31,412
SAM: Sure. How do you spell Jester?

887
00:55:31,412 --> 00:55:32,519
LAURA: Like normal.

888
00:55:32,519 --> 00:55:34,197
SAM: Okay.

889
00:55:34,197 --> 00:55:37,876
MARISHA: Maybe we can dump them, backtrack with
the cart, and drop the cart back off.

890
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:43,003
TRAVIS: As we've been riding, have we seen any
tracks that we think might have belonged to the

891
00:55:43,003 --> 00:55:45,651
toad? Since it was leaping in these huge arcs.

892
00:55:45,651 --> 00:55:47,806
MATT: Make a survival check.

893
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:52,385
TRAVIS: Ugh, three.

894
00:55:52,385 --> 00:55:56,974
MATT: Even with your darkvision, it's hard to make
out too many details. There's a lot of foot

895
00:55:56,974 --> 00:56:02,494
traffic along the banks of the river at different
points in the day. There's not a lot of light.

896
00:56:02,494 --> 00:56:05,081
You're unable to pick up any tracks.

897
00:56:05,081 --> 00:56:12,172
LAURA: Maybe we dump the bodies and I'll get out
and try to make the tracks go away for a little

898
00:56:12,172 --> 00:56:16,155
bit. I'll walk up the path and do like this.

899
00:56:16,155 --> 00:56:18,810
TRAVIS: Why? We could get rid of the wagon later.

900
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:24,098
LAURA: Yeah, but the wagon will come from the
carnival straight to the bodies. Isn't that weird?

901
00:56:24,098 --> 00:56:29,936
LIAM: You'd have to erase the tracks all the way
back to the-- how far back are you willing to go?

902
00:56:29,936 --> 00:56:32,189
LAURA: Not that far.

903
00:56:32,189 --> 00:56:36,467
LIAM: What's the plan here? Are we going to flee?

904
00:56:36,467 --> 00:56:38,692
LAURA: I think we have to go back to the inn,
right?

905
00:56:38,692 --> 00:56:40,564
TRAVIS: Once the sun comes up--

906
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:45,014
LIAM: I know. Everybody's in deep shit. I
understand the problem, but my question is are we

907
00:56:45,014 --> 00:56:46,250
cutting and running?

908
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:47,405
LAURA: Yeah.

909
00:56:47,405 --> 00:56:48,962
LIAM: No, I mean cutting and running.

910
00:56:48,962 --> 00:56:50,993
TRAVIS: No, no, we can't just leave.

911
00:56:50,993 --> 00:56:52,544
LAURA: Oh, okay.

912
00:56:52,544 --> 00:56:54,429
LIAM: We do it all the time.

913
00:56:54,429 --> 00:56:56,490
LAURA: Well...

914
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:02,895
TRAVIS: Let's see if we can find the toad. If the
sun starts to break, then we'll make up our mind.

915
00:57:03,007 --> 00:57:07,558
LAURA: All right. Are we dumping these bodies or
what?

916
00:57:07,558 --> 00:57:09,532
TRAVIS: Yes, kick them out.

917
00:57:09,532 --> 00:57:13,682
MATT: Okay, so you remove the bodies from the
cart. Are you dumping them on the shoreline?

918
00:57:13,682 --> 00:57:14,700
LAURA: Yeah.

919
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:21,111
MATT: Okay. (thud, thud) The two transformed guard
corpses now lie there. One an ashy mess, the other

920
00:57:21,111 --> 00:57:25,541
in three pieces. Left along the bank of the
water.

921
00:57:25,541 --> 00:57:30,511
LAURA: I get out and I start positioning them like
maybe they were having a romantic tryst.

922
00:57:30,511 --> 00:57:33,433
LIAM: Those two burnt men? Yes.

923
00:57:33,433 --> 00:57:35,435
MATT: Okay. (laughs)

924
00:57:35,435 --> 00:57:39,664
MARISHA: I'm going to help Jester try and clear
the tracks while she positions bodies.

925
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:41,697
MATT: Make a survival check.

926
00:57:44,276 --> 00:57:46,735
MARISHA: (disgusted noise) Eight.

927
00:57:46,735 --> 00:57:49,303
MATT: All right. You guys--

928
00:57:49,303 --> 00:57:51,411
(laughter)

929
00:57:51,411 --> 00:57:54,164
TRAVIS: Anybody else want to look for some toad
prints?

930
00:57:54,164 --> 00:57:56,581
LAURA: Do you want us to?

931
00:57:56,581 --> 00:57:59,979
SAM: We were going to go along the north way,
right?

932
00:57:59,979 --> 00:58:01,879
TRAVIS: We've been doing that already.

933
00:58:01,879 --> 00:58:07,149
MARISHA: If we try and cover the wagon tracks as
much as we can, then follow the embankment and try

934
00:58:07,149 --> 00:58:14,171
and ride the horses and the cart along the water,
it'll hide our tracks as we move northward.

935
00:58:14,171 --> 00:58:16,240
LAURA: Sure, let's do that.

936
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,198
MARISHA: Okay.

937
00:58:18,198 --> 00:58:19,759
TALIESIN: Who are you?

938
00:58:19,759 --> 00:58:21,924
TRAVIS: That's actually a great idea.

939
00:58:21,924 --> 00:58:25,645
TALIESIN: That's really clever. Why would you even
think that?

940
00:58:25,645 --> 00:58:29,523
LAURA: Oh, she's all about shady shit. She does a
lot of it.

941
00:58:29,523 --> 00:58:30,422
TALIESIN: Huh.

942
00:58:30,422 --> 00:58:31,832
MARISHA: You understand.

943
00:58:31,832 --> 00:58:33,923
TALIESIN: Maybe. I don't know. I'll think about
it.

944
00:58:33,923 --> 00:58:38,543
LAURA: (singsong) Go to sleep, little tiefling.

945
00:58:38,543 --> 00:58:40,693
TALIESIN: Ow, that hurts. Ow.

946
00:58:40,693 --> 00:58:43,222
LIAM: Beauregard, are the people on the boat doing
anything different?

947
00:58:43,222 --> 00:58:47,655
MATT: You glance back over and you can see the
boat seems to have moved a little bit further away

948
00:58:47,655 --> 00:58:51,159
and has come up to the bank and looks like it's
hitting land.

949
00:58:51,159 --> 00:58:53,012
MARISHA: Towards us?

950
00:58:53,012 --> 00:58:56,655
MATT: No, a little bit further away and then has
hit the land. The figures are currently taking

951
00:58:56,655 --> 00:58:58,194
things out of the boat.

952
00:58:58,194 --> 00:58:59,640
LAURA: They're late night fishermen.

953
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:02,963
MARISHA: I think they're fishermen. Let's keep
moving.

954
00:59:02,963 --> 00:59:04,492
MATT: Okay, which direction are you moving?

955
00:59:04,492 --> 00:59:05,528
MARISHA: North.

956
00:59:05,528 --> 00:59:09,531
MATT: Well, north is into the water. Like you hit
the water of the bottom of the lake.

957
00:59:09,531 --> 00:59:13,182
SAM: The toad went due north? Like straight into
the water?

958
00:59:13,282 --> 00:59:15,097
MATT: That's the direction it was traveling.

959
00:59:15,097 --> 00:59:17,048
LAURA: Can I look for toad tracks?

960
00:59:17,048 --> 00:59:18,853
MATT: Make a survival check, sure.

961
00:59:18,853 --> 00:59:20,773
TRAVIS: Come on, don't roll Sam's fucking dice.

962
00:59:20,773 --> 00:59:22,002
LAURA: I didn't.

963
00:59:22,002 --> 00:59:24,222
MATT: Oh, Sam.

964
00:59:24,222 --> 00:59:26,221
TALIESIN: That was a lot.

965
00:59:26,221 --> 00:59:34,259
LAURA: That was a whole lot of rolls. Survival.
11.

966
00:59:34,259 --> 00:59:43,760
MATT: 11. It's hard to really make out what tracks
are what. You do see a few heavy impacts in the

967
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:49,530
mud. Some of them looks like it could have been
the bodies being rolled, but not too far from

968
00:59:49,530 --> 00:59:55,523
where you are, there's one big smack in the mud.
Like something heavy impacted.

969
00:59:55,523 --> 01:00:00,218
LAURA: Fjord! Come look at this! This is
definitely toad tracks.

970
01:00:00,218 --> 01:00:08,046
TRAVIS: In the shape that it's in, this print. Are
their toes pointing in a specific direction?

971
01:00:08,046 --> 01:00:12,214
MATT: Make an investigation check.

972
01:00:12,214 --> 01:00:13,619
TALIESIN: Well, this will break my short rest.

973
01:00:13,619 --> 01:00:15,161
MATT: This will break your short rest.

974
01:00:18,301 --> 01:00:19,574
TRAVIS: 14.

975
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:26,844
MATT: You can see the heavy impact has a few
subtler imprints. There do appear to be two hands

976
01:00:26,844 --> 01:00:32,601
and two feet though the water has washed in and
gotten rid of a lot of the details at this point.

977
01:00:32,601 --> 01:00:35,175
You can vaguely tell they appear to be facing
towards the water.

978
01:00:35,175 --> 01:00:39,629
LAURA: That lump is the toad.

979
01:00:39,629 --> 01:00:41,890
SAM: Could be.

980
01:00:41,890 --> 01:00:44,072
TALIESIN: How many people in the boat?

981
01:00:44,072 --> 01:00:45,517
TRAVIS: Two.

982
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:48,064
TALIESIN: How many people are we looking for?

983
01:00:48,064 --> 01:00:51,235
TRAVIS: One and a giant toad.

984
01:00:51,235 --> 01:00:52,562
TALIESIN: Didn't he leave with a--

985
01:00:52,562 --> 01:00:53,504
TRAVIS: Girl.

986
01:00:53,504 --> 01:00:55,969
TALIESIN: Two people?

987
01:00:55,969 --> 01:00:57,490
MATT: Two people in the boat.

988
01:00:57,490 --> 01:01:00,538
MARISHA: Do these silhouettes look proportionate
to each other?

989
01:01:00,538 --> 01:01:03,206
MATT: They look proportionate to each other.

990
01:01:03,206 --> 01:01:04,974
TRAVIS: Does one look like Gorilla Grodd and---

991
01:01:04,974 --> 01:01:09,515
MATT: They both look vaguely humanoid and
regular.

992
01:01:09,515 --> 01:01:14,155
MARISHA: Which way did the fisherman go?

993
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:19,437
MATT: They are a little bit to the west along the
bank in the direction of the city. The city is

994
01:01:19,437 --> 01:01:23,732
northwest of you currently. If you were to
continue around the lake--

995
01:01:23,732 --> 01:01:27,386
LIAM: Because the city is on the lake so we're
just around the edge of the lake.

996
01:01:27,386 --> 01:01:29,072
MATT: Exactly.

997
01:01:29,072 --> 01:01:32,892
MARISHA: I think we should keep heading away from
the city, right?

998
01:01:32,892 --> 01:01:35,416
LIAM: It depends on what we're going to do.

999
01:01:35,416 --> 01:01:39,286
SAM: If we're chasing the toad it seems like we
need to find a boat and go out into the water.

1000
01:01:39,286 --> 01:01:42,698
LAURA: So we head towards that boat that hit
land.

1001
01:01:42,698 --> 01:01:44,089
SAM: Steal that boat?

1002
01:01:44,089 --> 01:01:48,483
LAURA: If we go towards the toad we are going to
fight the toad.

1003
01:01:48,483 --> 01:01:54,579
SAM: Well no, we are just going to find the toad.
You said this. We're camping and waiting and

1004
01:01:54,579 --> 01:01:55,790
resting.

1005
01:01:55,790 --> 01:02:02,099
LIAM: The other thing we can do, but it will take
some time, need about an hour. Frumpkin is a cat

1006
01:02:02,099 --> 01:02:06,731
but Frumpkin does not need to be a cat. I could
fly him over as well but I need time, I need about

1007
01:02:06,731 --> 01:02:08,107
an hour.

1008
01:02:08,107 --> 01:02:09,608
SAM: Or swim.

1009
01:02:09,608 --> 01:02:12,448
TALIESIN: I'm actively tracking this creature,
aren't I on a certain level?

1010
01:02:12,448 --> 01:02:16,535
MATT: I mean, if you want to. You haven't yet
decided to.

1011
01:02:16,535 --> 01:02:20,899
TALIESIN: I hadn't really thought about it. It's
something I can in theory do.

1012
01:02:20,899 --> 01:02:22,663
LAURA: Because you used your blood on it?

1013
01:02:22,663 --> 01:02:27,482
TALIESIN: No. This would also break my short rest,
wouldn't it?

1014
01:02:27,482 --> 01:02:30,019
MATT: Actually, I'd say for the points of
expediency, with the time it has taken you and

1015
01:02:30,019 --> 01:02:34,457
have these discussion at the edge, it's pushing
2:30 like 3:00 in the morning and both of you have

1016
01:02:34,457 --> 01:02:36,126
finished the short rest.

1017
01:02:36,126 --> 01:02:44,691
TALIESIN: I'm going to use Hunter's Bane really
quickly and look at the track for a second.

1018
01:02:44,691 --> 01:02:48,031
MATT: You get your blood maledict and you can use
your hit dice if you want.

1019
01:02:48,061 --> 01:02:50,025
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to do both of those.

1020
01:02:50,025 --> 01:02:54,884
LIAM: I changed my mind, I believe I used arcane
recovery during the day. So forget it.

1021
01:02:54,884 --> 01:02:57,310
MATT: Yeah, it's gone.

1022
01:02:57,310 --> 01:02:58,809
SAM: You can hit dice it.

1023
01:02:58,809 --> 01:03:01,007
LAURA: I bet you have a thing where you can click
it on.

1024
01:03:01,007 --> 01:03:03,243
TALIESIN: Now I'm at 12 hit points.

1025
01:03:03,243 --> 01:03:04,972
MATT: That's better, there you go.

1026
01:03:04,972 --> 01:03:06,647
TRAVIS: 12?

1027
01:03:06,647 --> 01:03:08,911
MATT: Better than one.

1028
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:19,457
TALIESIN: Yay 12 hit points. I'm going to see if I
can help with the tracking because I'm going to

1029
01:03:19,457 --> 01:03:21,868
start actively tracking this particular creature.

1030
01:03:21,868 --> 01:03:23,379
MATT: Make a survival check.

1031
01:03:23,379 --> 01:03:25,849
TALIESIN: Survival check? Which I have advantage
on.

1032
01:03:25,849 --> 01:03:28,360
MATT: You have advantage on it because it's a
feat.

1033
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:31,070
LIAM: If I have an hour to do some
ritual casting, yeah.

1034
01:03:31,070 --> 01:03:32,040
TALIESIN: 18.

1035
01:03:32,356 --> 01:03:39,086
MATT: Looking at the imprint you follow back the
direction of the carnival and you can see the path

1036
01:03:39,086 --> 01:03:47,665
because it was a beeline toward the Ustaloch. The
best you can tell because the water picks up

1037
01:03:47,665 --> 01:03:52,736
there's no trail to pick up in the water. Looking
at the trajectory, it was very intently making its

1038
01:03:52,736 --> 01:03:58,839
way towards the water either avoiding making any
more tracks and making it difficult to follow.

1039
01:03:58,839 --> 01:04:01,191
TALIESIN: Guy went into the water.

1040
01:04:01,191 --> 01:04:06,226
LAURA: That's what we figured.

1041
01:04:06,226 --> 01:04:10,333
TALIESIN: Do you think he's trying to swim all the
way to the other side or you think he's just going

1042
01:04:10,333 --> 01:04:11,761
around the lake?

1043
01:04:11,761 --> 01:04:15,490
TRAVIS: We're not lucky enough to have any small
boats along the shores that have been beached?

1044
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:20,486
MATT: Not near you. There's the one that you saw
the two fishermen are at right now. Then further

1045
01:04:20,486 --> 01:04:25,455
into the city the docks, there's plenty of boats
that are tied up and locked.

1046
01:04:25,455 --> 01:04:27,488
LIAM: At the level two-- Oh sorry, go ahead.

1047
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:28,608
MARISHA: Go ahead.

1048
01:04:28,608 --> 01:04:30,467
LIAM: It's a rules question, you go for it.

1049
01:04:30,467 --> 01:04:41,861
MARISHA: Even if we find this thing, if we rest
camping out then we're not at the tavern.

1050
01:04:41,861 --> 01:04:45,212
TRAVIS: Yeah, we got like four hours until
sunrise.

1051
01:04:45,212 --> 01:04:49,945
SAM: Do any of us know what's beyond? Like what's
on the other side of this lake? Is it a mountain?

1052
01:04:49,945 --> 01:04:51,243
LAURA: Straight across.

1053
01:04:51,243 --> 01:04:56,378
MATT: The other side of the lake, from what you
know, because you were traveling southward towards

1054
01:04:56,378 --> 01:05:00,253
it, there's no major landmass on the other side of
the lake. It's just open field. You notice what

1055
01:05:00,253 --> 01:05:05,187
looks to be some sort of a bulge in the landmass
in the center. Too large to be the toad, but it

1056
01:05:05,187 --> 01:05:08,032
does seem to break up the water horizon from that
vantage point.

1057
01:05:08,192 --> 01:05:09,705
LAURA: It could have gone to the island.

1058
01:05:09,705 --> 01:05:11,413
MARISHA: I bet that's exactly where it is.

1059
01:05:11,413 --> 01:05:16,759
TRAVIS: How do we feel about the knowledge that
it's somewhere here in the lake, perhaps, or the

1060
01:05:16,759 --> 01:05:21,705
other side? Circling back tomorrow? At least we'll
avoid suspicion if we're at the inn.

1061
01:05:21,705 --> 01:05:24,440
LAURA: Will you be able to keep tracking it? After you sleep?

1062
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:30,721
TALIESIN: I don't know. I'm not sure. Maybe. Could
be.

1063
01:05:30,721 --> 01:05:34,087
MATT: It's not like a mental tracking ability.
It's to be able to see details of the specific

1064
01:05:34,087 --> 01:05:35,295
type of tracks.

1065
01:05:35,295 --> 01:05:38,816
TALIESIN: I legitimately do not know how it works.
Sorry.

1066
01:05:38,816 --> 01:05:45,804
MATT: Just like any other tracking, you still need
to have things to follow. You can read damage in

1067
01:05:45,804 --> 01:05:48,869
the forest to see if something barreled through.
You can follow tracks. You can see blood

1068
01:05:48,869 --> 01:05:54,250
splatters. Any sort of thing that can give you an idea of
where something went that is of those types of creatures.

1069
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:56,626
TALIESIN: Do I know what he was, by the way?

1070
01:05:56,626 --> 01:05:58,309
LAURA: He was a fiend.

1071
01:05:58,309 --> 01:06:02,578
MATT: With the knowledge of it being a fiend, go
ahead and make a religion check.

1072
01:06:02,696 --> 01:06:05,616
TALIESIN: And I get advantage on that.

1073
01:06:05,616 --> 01:06:07,316
MATT: You do, actually.

1074
01:06:07,316 --> 01:06:11,096
TALIESIN: Religion check? 15.

1075
01:06:11,096 --> 01:06:24,551
MATT: 15? Now that they've mentioned a fiend, it seems
familiar, but the most you can get is

1076
01:06:24,551 --> 01:06:30,437
a memory that you don't know where it
came from, this memory of horrible toad-like

1077
01:06:30,437 --> 01:06:34,077
demonic creatures that exist to the far east in Xhorhas.

1078
01:06:34,077 --> 01:06:39,549
That's as much as you can recall. But you're
definitely sitting here now with this memory

1079
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:42,921
that comes to mind, going, "This whole time! This 
whole time--"

1080
01:06:42,921 --> 01:06:44,974
TALIESIN: This whole time I've been sitting with
this.

1081
01:06:44,974 --> 01:06:54,367
LIAM: Rules question. Caleb is too fucking poor to
change Frumpkin's shape willy-nilly because it's

1082
01:06:54,367 --> 01:07:01,692
ten gold pieces worth of charcoal, incense, and
herbs, which I don't have. So he's a cat for the

1083
01:07:01,692 --> 01:07:03,565
foreseeable future.

1084
01:07:03,565 --> 01:07:05,381
SAM: Do you just need ten gold pieces?

1085
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:08,692
LIAM: I need incense, herbs, and charcoal.

1086
01:07:08,692 --> 01:07:10,556
TALIESIN: Are you saying this out loud?

1087
01:07:10,556 --> 01:07:12,798
LIAM: No, I'm just talking in my accent to you.

1088
01:07:12,798 --> 01:07:16,823
TALIESIN: Listening to this, I reach in. 
I've got some incense.

1089
01:07:16,823 --> 01:07:18,898
LIAM: Do you have charcoal?

1090
01:07:18,898 --> 01:07:21,789
TRAVIS: I'm sure we can find some charcoal.

1091
01:07:21,789 --> 01:07:23,843
TALIESIN: Isn't this impressive enough that I
happen to have some incense?

1092
01:07:23,843 --> 01:07:26,072
LIAM: If we can get back into town somehow.

1093
01:07:26,072 --> 01:07:28,321
SAM: We're going to go shopping at three in the
morning?

1094
01:07:28,321 --> 01:07:31,267
MATT: Technically, elements of that guard's body
are charcoal now.

1095
01:07:31,267 --> 01:07:34,927
MARISHA: That's what I was going to say.
Let's go back and raid the fire.

1096
01:07:34,927 --> 01:07:39,310
TALIESIN: There'd also be a fire inside the inn,
to be fair. Charcoal is-- it's not like it's hard to get.

1097
01:07:39,464 --> 01:07:42,634
TRAVIS: And you two seem to be able to move freely,
without suspicion.

1098
01:07:42,634 --> 01:07:44,523
TALIESIN: That's true, you can go shopping more.

1099
01:07:44,523 --> 01:07:46,277
LIAM: I will.

1100
01:07:46,277 --> 01:07:49,778
TALIESIN: Let's go maintain the illusion of
innocence for the evening.

1101
01:07:49,778 --> 01:07:53,543
MARISHA: Should we walk the cart off?

1102
01:07:53,543 --> 01:07:55,395
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1103
01:07:55,395 --> 01:08:03,792
TRAVIS: And leave it outside town as we're
making our way back.

1104
01:08:03,792 --> 01:08:06,519
Maybe give the horse a little spank 
on the ass and send it on its way.

1105
01:08:06,519 --> 01:08:08,666
MARISHA: See where it goes. I like that.

1106
01:08:08,666 --> 01:08:12,188
TRAVIS: Shall we?

1107
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:13,948
LAURA: It's open 24 hours.

1108
01:08:13,948 --> 01:08:19,099
LIAM: That random book about fiends has all the
answers about the fiend we're chasing. Let's go

1109
01:08:19,099 --> 01:08:20,784
get it.

1110
01:08:20,784 --> 01:08:22,074
LAURA: Yeah. You should do that.

1111
01:08:22,074 --> 01:08:28,303
TALIESIN: Xhorhas. It's a creature from Xhorhas.
I'm pretty sure, I don't know. We'll see.

1112
01:08:28,303 --> 01:08:32,768
God, I'm remembering something.

1113
01:08:32,768 --> 01:08:34,128
LAURA: Let's go.

1114
01:08:34,128 --> 01:08:35,751
TRAVIS: We head back.

1115
01:08:35,751 --> 01:08:40,886
MARISHA: We go along the lake, then off to the edge,
and then we're going to give the horse a slap and send

1116
01:08:41,153 --> 01:08:42,683
him off past--

1117
01:08:42,683 --> 01:08:47,502
MATT: Okay, so the cart makes its way. 
The two fishermen you see are in the process

1118
01:08:47,502 --> 01:08:55,851
of tying up nets and bags of things, and they just
stop and watch you guys ride by, then go about the

1119
01:08:56,008 --> 01:09:01,973
rest of their work. You continue with the cart,
pulling it up toward the southern edge of where the

1120
01:09:01,973 --> 01:09:09,607
Ustaloch meets Trostenwald, and you can abandon it
there, or you said you wanted to send it somewhere?

1121
01:09:09,607 --> 01:09:15,001
LAURA: I don't think we would have taken the cart
past the fishermen. Are we going to do that?

1122
01:09:15,001 --> 01:09:18,434
TRAVIS: I thought we were going to head back 
to the village, to a good distance.

1123
01:09:18,434 --> 01:09:21,770
LIAM: How much ground did we cover, I don't know?

1124
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:23,898
MATT: So what are you doing?

1125
01:09:23,898 --> 01:09:28,296
TRAVIS: We're taking the cart back to a distance
from the city.

1126
01:09:28,296 --> 01:09:29,548
LIAM: Half a mile.

1127
01:09:29,548 --> 01:09:32,935
TRAVIS: Yeah, and then letting the horses run,
so the-- sending the track off.

1128
01:09:32,935 --> 01:09:34,472
MATT: I see. Okay.

1129
01:09:34,472 --> 01:09:39,951
LAURA: I don't think we would have gone right past
the fishermen that would be able to identify us.

1130
01:09:39,951 --> 01:09:42,144
MARISHA: Using the lake to hide tracks.

1131
01:09:42,144 --> 01:09:48,628
MATT: Okay, so you guys head the opposite direction for a
little ways after the field. All right. Who's spooking the horses?

1132
01:09:48,628 --> 01:09:50,670
LIAM: That's your specialty.

1133
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:53,701
MARISHA: Whack with the stick.

1134
01:09:53,701 --> 01:09:56,144
MATT: Make an animal handling check.

1135
01:09:56,144 --> 01:10:01,490
TRAVIS: Please roll bad. If there is any 
justice in the world...

1136
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:06,019
MARISHA: It's not great. Thanks, Travis. Thanks. Six.

1137
01:10:06,153 --> 01:10:08,816
SAM: Six? To hit a horse?

1138
01:10:08,816 --> 01:10:11,272
MARISHA: Correctly hit a horse!

1139
01:10:11,272 --> 01:10:15,138
LAURA: The horse whimpers; you hurt a horse.

1140
01:10:15,138 --> 01:10:16,834
MATT: What's your armor class?

1141
01:10:16,834 --> 01:10:18,632
MARISHA: 17.

1142
01:10:18,632 --> 01:10:23,630
MATT: 17? As soon as you hit it, there's a
(whinny) and there's a split-second where you watch

1143
01:10:23,630 --> 01:10:29,549
its back leg muscle twitch, and you duck out of the
way just as its back hooves (whoosh) past your face.

1144
01:10:29,598 --> 01:10:33,971
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk over to the horses and--
they're trained horses.

1145
01:10:33,971 --> 01:10:35,314
MATT: Yeah.

1146
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:37,859
TALIESIN: I'm going to go whisper in their ear and
give them a little pat.

1147
01:10:37,859 --> 01:10:42,890
MATT: Make an animal handling check.

1148
01:10:42,890 --> 01:10:44,999
LAURA: You rolled shit, too!

1149
01:10:44,999 --> 01:10:46,516
TALIESIN: Nine.

1150
01:10:46,516 --> 01:10:52,314
TRAVIS: Horses are our new door!

1151
01:10:52,390 --> 01:10:54,058
LIAM: Drops a couple of horse apples.

1152
01:10:54,058 --> 01:10:56,289
TALIESIN: I didn't get advantage on that because I knew
the animals, did I?

1153
01:10:56,289 --> 01:10:59,935
MATT: No. You knew the animals, but you weren't
the animal handler.

1154
01:10:59,935 --> 01:11:03,534
LAURA: I use Thaumaturgy and I make the sound of
like a predator behind them.

1155
01:11:03,534 --> 01:11:08,154
MATT: Okay. I'll give you an animal handling check
with advantage, because it's fun.

1156
01:11:08,154 --> 01:11:09,825
TALIESIN: I'm into this.

1157
01:11:09,825 --> 01:11:12,346
LAURA: Okay, 13!

1158
01:11:12,346 --> 01:11:16,489
MATT: 13! It's above a ten, guys! Awesome!

1159
01:11:16,489 --> 01:11:20,440
ALL: (chanting) Level two!

1160
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,888
TALIESIN: This is Romper Room!

1161
01:11:22,888 --> 01:11:28,453
MATT: Yeah, I know! With a crack, and a heavy
echoing snarling sound in the vicinity, both

1162
01:11:28,453 --> 01:11:35,531
horses kick up and go into a full gallop sprint
away from the direction of you, the cart being

1163
01:11:35,531 --> 01:11:41,344
dragged behind it. They continue to go into the
shadow. You don't know how long they're going to go.

1164
01:11:41,344 --> 01:11:43,879
LIAM: I cast Thaumaturgy! (quacks)

1165
01:11:43,879 --> 01:11:48,774
MATT: By the time you guys make it back to the
inn--

1166
01:11:48,774 --> 01:11:50,595
LAURA: Those ducks are scary!

1167
01:11:50,595 --> 01:11:52,586
MATT: Are you guys being careful, or are you just
walking back?

1168
01:11:52,586 --> 01:11:54,060
LAURA: We're being careful.

1169
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:55,921
MATT: I'd like you all to roll a stealth check,
please.

1170
01:11:55,921 --> 01:11:58,904
TRAVIS: I'm going to use Mask of Many Faces to
make myself look old.

1171
01:11:58,904 --> 01:12:00,498
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

1172
01:12:00,498 --> 01:12:02,736
SAM: What was that? I don't even know what that
was.

1173
01:12:02,736 --> 01:12:05,072
TALIESIN: Look at all that stuff!

1174
01:12:05,072 --> 01:12:09,527
LAURA: I'm going to-- Does anybody have shitty stealth?

1175
01:12:09,527 --> 01:12:13,160
TALIESIN: I can't even see myself with this
roll.

1176
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,343
LIAM: I do, but I rolled 12.

1177
01:12:15,343 --> 01:12:19,774
LAURA: Well okay, I was going to give anybody
advantage, but here you go.

1178
01:12:19,774 --> 01:12:21,693
SAM: Thank you.

1179
01:12:21,693 --> 01:12:24,216
LAURA: Wow, that was bad.

1180
01:12:24,216 --> 01:12:26,963
LIAM: You have advantage, right? Roll again!

1181
01:12:26,963 --> 01:12:28,603
SAM: I already rolled once.

1182
01:12:28,603 --> 01:12:30,635
TRAVIS: 18, but I'm also--

1183
01:12:30,635 --> 01:12:34,338
LIAM: 16.

1184
01:12:34,338 --> 01:12:35,313
MARISHA: 17.

1185
01:12:35,313 --> 01:12:36,376
LAURA: 18.

1186
01:12:36,376 --> 01:12:37,552
TALIESIN: Technically, my stealth would be 23.

1187
01:12:37,552 --> 01:12:38,542
SAM: 11.

1188
01:12:38,542 --> 01:12:41,583
MATT: All right, that's fine. You manage to make
it to the Nestled Nook Inn without any prying eyes

1189
01:12:41,583 --> 01:12:55,095
seeing too deeply into your movement. You get back
to your rooms as the very faint distant change of

1190
01:12:55,095 --> 01:13:04,232
black night begins to turn to the faintest of blue
of morning curling over. You guys go to your

1191
01:13:04,232 --> 01:13:05,889
respective rooms, and you take a rest?

1192
01:13:05,889 --> 01:13:07,478
LAURA: We should go to sleep.

1193
01:13:07,478 --> 01:13:13,195
LIAM: I'm going to dig some charcoal out of the
remains of the fire in the common room and then go

1194
01:13:13,195 --> 01:13:14,514
to bed.

1195
01:13:14,514 --> 01:13:18,846
MATT: Okay. The owner watches you do that and
she's just, "Whatever."

1196
01:13:18,846 --> 01:13:22,803
LIAM: Don't thank me. Lovely inn. Good night.

1197
01:13:22,803 --> 01:13:25,757
MATT: "Don't get anything else dirty!"

1198
01:13:25,757 --> 01:13:28,149
LIAM: Just going to draw some dicks!

1199
01:13:28,149 --> 01:13:30,951
MATT: You guys complete a long rest.

1200
01:13:30,951 --> 01:13:33,960
TRAVIS: We made it!

1201
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:40,301
SAM: One day down. Two days down!

1202
01:13:40,301 --> 01:13:44,546
LAURA: Do we reset our max hit points when we take
a long rest?

1203
01:13:44,546 --> 01:13:49,305
MATT: Your max hit points? I mean, your max hit
points are your max hit points.

1204
01:13:49,305 --> 01:13:53,291
TALIESIN: When you hit 'long rest', it should
auto-reset.

1205
01:13:53,291 --> 01:13:55,776
SAM: With D&D Beyond, it does the work for you.

1206
01:13:55,776 --> 01:13:59,047
LIAM: Wait, is there a rest button?

1207
01:13:59,047 --> 01:14:01,099
SAM: There is, there are two rest buttons, Liam.

1208
01:14:01,099 --> 01:14:02,351
LIAM: Where are they?

1209
01:14:02,351 --> 01:14:06,210
SAM: They're down towards the bottom, short rest
or long rest.

1210
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:08,313
LIAM: Whoa!

1211
01:14:08,313 --> 01:14:17,585
LAURA: I fell asleep in my sketchbook, halfway
through my drawing of the two zombie guards making out.

1212
01:14:17,585 --> 01:14:21,628
SAM: Gross. Were they dead?

1213
01:14:21,628 --> 01:14:23,839
LAURA: They're zombies, so yeah!

1214
01:14:23,839 --> 01:14:25,496
TALIESIN: Slightly hotter, okay.

1215
01:14:25,496 --> 01:14:27,904
LAURA: One arm is like off to the side.

1216
01:14:27,904 --> 01:14:29,410
TALIESIN: Way hotter.

1217
01:14:29,410 --> 01:14:41,228
MATT: With full rests completed, consciousness
comes to on the outside of Jester's room with the

1218
01:14:41,228 --> 01:14:43,381
heavy sound of (knocking).

1219
01:14:43,381 --> 01:14:45,512
MARISHA: Jester!

1220
01:14:45,512 --> 01:14:46,908
LAURA: Is that our door?

1221
01:14:46,908 --> 01:14:48,415
MARISHA: I think so.

1222
01:14:48,415 --> 01:14:50,188
LAURA: Hold on, I'm naked!

1223
01:14:50,188 --> 01:14:55,279
MARISHA: Yeah, hold on, she's naked! Do you want
to get it? Or should I get it?

1224
01:14:55,279 --> 01:14:56,776
LAURA: I'll get it!

1225
01:14:56,776 --> 01:14:58,319
MARISHA: Maybe I should get it.

1226
01:14:58,319 --> 01:15:00,429
LAURA: No, I get up, I get it. Hello!

1227
01:15:00,429 --> 01:15:03,903
MATT: You open the door. The same two crownsguard
that had come the day before.

1228
01:15:03,903 --> 01:15:06,742
LAURA: Did you come back to play some games?

1229
01:15:06,742 --> 01:15:15,837
MATT: "No. We came to tell you that you'll be
needed for the investigation and questioning

1230
01:15:15,837 --> 01:15:24,252
"within the next three hours to arrive at the
behest of the Lawmaster at the stockade."

1231
01:15:24,252 --> 01:15:27,760
MARISHA: Why didn't you just come and get us when
you were ready for us?

1232
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:30,185
LAURA: Well, you know, we might want to brush our
teeth.

1233
01:15:30,185 --> 01:15:32,178
MARISHA: Does that take you three hours?

1234
01:15:32,178 --> 01:15:36,012
LAURA: No. Now we have time to--

1235
01:15:36,012 --> 01:15:38,817
MATT: "We'll be back in three hours."

1236
01:15:38,817 --> 01:15:43,256
LAURA: Okay. I'll see you soon! I miss you
already!

1237
01:15:43,256 --> 01:15:53,885
MATT: (door creaking) Habit of creeping out guards,
I like this. The rest of you come to consciousness.

1238
01:15:53,953 --> 01:16:01,749
You're rested. At this point in time, it's
past noon. It's about two in the afternoon.

1239
01:16:01,829 --> 01:16:04,365
TRAVIS: No knock on our door, only you two.

1240
01:16:04,365 --> 01:16:11,225
MATT: Well, no. It's these two currently, 
for the moment. Then-- (knocking).

1241
01:16:11,331 --> 01:16:14,025
TRAVIS: Your jury summons is (groans).

1242
01:16:14,025 --> 01:16:15,710
MATT: Just finishing up with them.

1243
01:16:15,710 --> 01:16:18,508
LAURA: It's two o'clock in the afternoon, you
said? When we woke up?!

1244
01:16:18,508 --> 01:16:19,615
MATT: Yes.

1245
01:16:19,615 --> 01:16:23,956
LIAM: We got back in the middle of the night. No
real job here.

1246
01:16:23,956 --> 01:16:25,870
TRAVIS: I'll open the door.

1247
01:16:25,870 --> 01:16:27,320
MATT: Two guards are there.

1248
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:28,437
TRAVIS: Yes?

1249
01:16:28,437 --> 01:16:33,869
MATT: "Sorry to disturb, the investigation will
require you in about three hours."

1250
01:16:33,869 --> 01:16:36,091
TRAVIS: I just shut the door.

1251
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:39,444
MARISHA: Love it! It's my favorite. I was waiting
for it.

1252
01:16:39,444 --> 01:16:43,699
MATT: All right, so. What are you guys doing?

1253
01:16:43,731 --> 01:16:47,798
SAM: Go down for breakfast?

1254
01:16:47,798 --> 01:16:51,311
LIAM: I go down. It's Yorda who runs the place?

1255
01:16:51,311 --> 01:16:52,358
MATT: Correct.

1256
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:55,131
LIAM: I find Yorda. Excuse me, a question about
the town.

1257
01:16:55,131 --> 01:16:59,242
MATT: She's right in the middle of pouring a drink, 
she's like, "Right! What do you need?"

1258
01:16:59,333 --> 01:17:02,430
LIAM: Is there a pawn shop anywhere in this city?

1259
01:17:02,430 --> 01:17:12,776
MATT: "If you're looking for strange wares in
general, then your best look would be Burnished Bibelots."

1260
01:17:12,776 --> 01:17:15,856
LIAM: Thank you.

1261
01:17:15,856 --> 01:17:26,222
MATT: "You might be able to talk to, let's see
here-- Lochward General might be interested in

1262
01:17:26,222 --> 01:17:27,491
"buying a few things."

1263
01:17:27,491 --> 01:17:28,479
LIAM: Wockwurt?

1264
01:17:28,479 --> 01:17:29,578
MATT: Lochward General.

1265
01:17:29,578 --> 01:17:34,029
LIAM: Lochward's General, of course. Excuse me.
That's in the Lochward, then?

1266
01:17:34,029 --> 01:17:36,703
MATT: Aye, it's about three blocks up north.

1267
01:17:36,703 --> 01:17:43,465
LIAM: Only been here two days. Okay, you are down
here?

1268
01:17:43,465 --> 01:17:45,220
SAM: I'm always with you.

1269
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:49,909
LIAM: Yeah, okay. That flask.

1270
01:17:49,909 --> 01:17:52,248
SAM: Yes? You saw that?

1271
01:17:52,248 --> 01:17:54,440
LIAM: Yes, I did see it.

1272
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:55,980
SAM: Sorry!

1273
01:17:55,980 --> 01:18:00,785
LIAM: No, I'm not sorry at all, but I have a big
favor to ask you. That's very valuable what you

1274
01:18:00,785 --> 01:18:03,211
have there. Do you know that is made of platinum?

1275
01:18:03,211 --> 01:18:07,418
SAM: Would I know that it's made of platinum, just
from glancing at it and feeling it?

1276
01:18:07,418 --> 01:18:11,296
MATT: It looks very pretty. Make an intelligence
check.

1277
01:18:11,296 --> 01:18:17,319
SAM: Not great. Just an intelligence check?

1278
01:18:17,319 --> 01:18:18,743
MATT: Yes, just your modifier.

1279
01:18:18,743 --> 01:18:20,201
SAM: Eight.

1280
01:18:20,201 --> 01:18:21,608
MATT: It's very shiny.

1281
01:18:21,608 --> 01:18:27,802
LIAM: Let me explain it to you. That little bottle
is worth a great deal. It can buy you many full bottles.

1282
01:18:27,802 --> 01:18:30,317
SAM: I don't want to get rid of it.

1283
01:18:30,317 --> 01:18:34,724
LIAM: Would you like to trade that for many bottles
of booze? Many.

1284
01:18:34,724 --> 01:18:44,311
SAM: That is a tough decision. But this is the
only one I have! I only have one flask.

1285
01:18:44,311 --> 01:18:49,610
LIAM: We could buy you another flask that can hold
whiskey just as well as that one. Here's the

1286
01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:54,864
thing, you know that I was very interested in
those books. We came here for books and booze.

1287
01:18:54,864 --> 01:19:00,891
You've gotten a little booze, but we can get a lot
and those books are expensive and I know that we

1288
01:19:00,891 --> 01:19:06,111
can get enough money for it and I really don't
feel like pushing our luck with the law here in

1289
01:19:06,111 --> 01:19:08,825
town and pulling a fast one again.

1290
01:19:08,825 --> 01:19:16,880
SAM: Oh, but it's so pretty. How about this for a
counteroffer: how much are the books?

1291
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:20,688
LIAM: They were worth a total of 13 gold.

1292
01:19:20,688 --> 01:19:22,489
SAM: Here!

1293
01:19:22,489 --> 01:19:26,030
LIAM: Did she just hand me 13 gold?

1294
01:19:26,030 --> 01:19:28,028
MATT: Yes.

1295
01:19:28,103 --> 01:19:29,624
SAM: I like this better.

1296
01:19:29,624 --> 01:19:31,813
(laughter)

1297
01:19:31,813 --> 01:19:34,287
LIAM: I take her by the head and I rustle our
heads together.

1298
01:19:34,287 --> 01:19:35,773
SAM: Stop!

1299
01:19:35,773 --> 01:19:39,475
LIAM: That's a good deal. I leave to find that
place.

1300
01:19:39,475 --> 01:19:41,062
SAM: I come with him.

1301
01:19:41,062 --> 01:19:45,037
LIAM: Oh, you're coming too? What a good day this
is! All right, let's go shopping!

1302
01:19:45,037 --> 01:19:52,006
MATT: All right, you guys make your way to Burnished
Bibelots. It is open, though there is nobody

1303
01:19:52,006 --> 01:19:57,444
currently inside the interior. As you go to the
door, it opens up and you see the same cluttered

1304
01:19:57,444 --> 01:20:04,910
mess of the inside. There across the way you see
the tiny gnome gentleman who's up on top of his

1305
01:20:04,910 --> 01:20:08,969
desk, his legs folded over each other. He's
looking through a book right now, as he's thumbing

1306
01:20:08,969 --> 01:20:11,663
through, "Hello!"

1307
01:20:11,663 --> 01:20:20,164
LIAM: Hello there, my friend! Just as I said, I've
returned. I have what we agreed on. 13 gold for

1308
01:20:20,164 --> 01:20:22,433
these two books that we discussed.

1309
01:20:22,433 --> 01:20:31,776
MATT: "Yes! Okay. Good! I have them held right here!"
He reaches back and then has to arrange himself again.

1310
01:20:31,776 --> 01:20:33,508
TRAVIS: And dies.

1311
01:20:33,508 --> 01:20:38,301
LIAM: Free books!

1312
01:20:38,301 --> 01:20:40,851
MARISHA: The best day ever!

1313
01:20:40,851 --> 01:20:46,104
MATT: Eventually he crawls off the top of the
desk, gets down there, puts the two books on the

1314
01:20:46,104 --> 01:20:56,597
top. "Wonderful doing business with you!" Slides
them forward to you, counts--

1315
01:20:56,664 --> 01:20:59,434
LIAM: These are the same two books? As yesterday?

1316
01:20:59,434 --> 01:21:01,621
MATT: "Those are the ones you told me to hold for
you, yes."

1317
01:21:01,621 --> 01:21:03,432
LIAM: Oh, I was asking Matthew, these are the same
two books?

1318
01:21:03,432 --> 01:21:04,403
MATT: Yes they are.

1319
01:21:04,403 --> 01:21:06,109
LIAM: Oh good! Excellent!

1320
01:21:06,109 --> 01:21:07,429
SAM: Your accent is confusing.

1321
01:21:07,429 --> 01:21:09,429
LAURA: I know, it's confusing when you speak
with the accent all the time!

1322
01:21:09,429 --> 01:21:15,777
LIAM: I never stopped with the British either last
time, so I'm never going to stop. Oh, I'm so

1323
01:21:15,777 --> 01:21:21,528
happy, and I'm saying this out loud as Caleb. Good
day to you!

1324
01:21:21,528 --> 01:21:23,833
SAM: Sure you don't want to--

1325
01:21:23,833 --> 01:21:27,890
LIAM: I scoop up Nott and I just start dancing
down the street with her up onto my shoulders!

1326
01:21:27,890 --> 01:21:30,076
SAM: Sure you don't want stay here and shop around
some more? Okay!

1327
01:21:30,076 --> 01:21:33,728
LIAM: No! We have plans to make with our new
friends! Let's go get some breakfast!

1328
01:21:33,728 --> 01:21:36,545
SAM: Okay, but I could've perused some of the
aisles and it's a long-- okay!

1329
01:21:36,545 --> 01:21:38,419
LIAM: Nope! We're away!

1330
01:21:38,419 --> 01:21:40,889
TRAVIS: No hands in your pockets order.

1331
01:21:40,889 --> 01:21:45,913
MATT: You guys make your way back as the rest of
you have come to consciousness and you head

1332
01:21:45,913 --> 01:21:48,138
down to the tavern.

1333
01:21:48,138 --> 01:21:52,627
LAURA: Cool. Why are you guys so happy?

1334
01:21:52,627 --> 01:21:56,668
LIAM: Good shopping run. Where did you get 13
gold?

1335
01:21:56,668 --> 01:22:01,453
SAM: I've always had it, you never asked for any.

1336
01:22:01,453 --> 01:22:06,284
LIAM: Good to know. I don't need to know anything
more, I'm just happy that you have it. I'm

1337
01:22:06,284 --> 01:22:07,279
thankful.

1338
01:22:07,279 --> 01:22:12,985
SAM: I collect things. Among them are pieces
of gold. I have more.

1339
01:22:12,985 --> 01:22:17,023
LIAM: I just squeeze the cheeks, and I look at my
books!

1340
01:22:17,023 --> 01:22:20,268
SAM: Ooh! You made my cheeks all green!

1341
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:23,450
MATT: So it'll take you a few hours to go through
those books.

1342
01:22:23,450 --> 01:22:28,674
LIAM: Yes. I will start on the one about fiends
because it is topical!

1343
01:22:28,674 --> 01:22:35,084
MATT: You begin to read through it. In the tavern
at the table, or do you want to read in your room?

1344
01:22:35,084 --> 01:22:36,155
Up to you.

1345
01:22:36,155 --> 01:22:37,836
LIAM: No I'm going to read here. Good focus!

1346
01:22:37,836 --> 01:22:39,433
LAURA: Can I look at one of your books?

1347
01:22:39,433 --> 01:22:40,922
LIAM: Yeah, go away.

1348
01:22:40,922 --> 01:22:43,516
LAURA: Is that a yes? You said yes.

1349
01:22:43,516 --> 01:22:47,919
LIAM: I shove the book deep into my belt near my
dick so she doesn't want to go near it!

1350
01:22:47,919 --> 01:22:50,404
LAURA: I'm not afraid of dicks.

1351
01:22:50,404 --> 01:22:52,650
MARISHA: She's not your sister anymore.

1352
01:22:52,650 --> 01:22:56,578
LIAM: Good point. Hey now.

1353
01:22:56,578 --> 01:23:04,063
SAM: He gets like this when he's studying. He gets
very focused, it's best not to disturb him.

1354
01:23:04,063 --> 01:23:08,627
MATT: It's an interesting book. It talks about
different forms of fiends and demons and the

1355
01:23:08,627 --> 01:23:16,044
hierarchy of the Nine Hells. It talks about myths
and stories of devils and demons interfering with

1356
01:23:16,044 --> 01:23:25,702
the lives of mortals. A lot of it is fables, a lot
of it is warnings and things that parents would

1357
01:23:25,702 --> 01:23:31,065
tell to keep their children from wandering in the
darkness. But it does have little tidbits of

1358
01:23:31,065 --> 01:23:36,261
information about different types, and they talk
about horned devils, and they talk about the great

1359
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:42,949
and terrible balor and pit fiend, and it seems to
be a jumble between both demons and devils.

1360
01:23:42,949 --> 01:23:47,621
LAURA: Can I look over his shoulder the whole time
he's reading it?

1361
01:23:47,621 --> 01:23:49,808
MATT: Sure, if he lets you.

1362
01:23:49,808 --> 01:23:51,672
LIAM: I do not let her. I am in a corner.

1363
01:23:51,672 --> 01:23:55,193
TRAVIS: And it's about 2:30 to 3:00?

1364
01:23:55,193 --> 01:23:57,035
MATT: Right now, it's about three.

1365
01:23:57,035 --> 01:23:59,505
TRAVIS: In the next couple hours they said they
would call for us.

1366
01:23:59,505 --> 01:24:00,919
MATT: Yes.

1367
01:24:00,919 --> 01:24:04,053
SAM: Should we go look for the toad?

1368
01:24:04,053 --> 01:24:07,515
TRAVIS: I was going to say, did they come to your
room as well?

1369
01:24:07,515 --> 01:24:10,531
LAURA: Yeah. In a couple hours.

1370
01:24:10,531 --> 01:24:15,540
MARISHA: Should we talk about what we're going to
say to them? Do we need to corroborate our stories?

1371
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:17,875
TRAVIS: I mean, we tell the truth, we did nothing
wrong.

1372
01:24:17,875 --> 01:24:20,517
LAURA: That's right, we were in this inn the whole
time.

1373
01:24:20,517 --> 01:24:22,516
MARISHA: That's true. Yeah.

1374
01:24:22,516 --> 01:24:28,751
TRAVIS: I was thinking that if we get out of there
tonight, fingers crossed, we should probably think

1375
01:24:28,751 --> 01:24:32,127
about acquiring some sort of vessel to explore the
lake tonight.

1376
01:24:32,127 --> 01:24:34,500
LAURA: We can definitely steal a boat.

1377
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:37,096
MARISHA: We know where a good fisherman's boat is.

1378
01:24:37,096 --> 01:24:40,389
TRAVIS: Or I may be able to arrange free passage
on a vessel.

1379
01:24:40,389 --> 01:24:41,680
MARISHA: What, how?

1380
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:44,965
TRAVIS: I have a little knack with, you know.

1381
01:24:44,965 --> 01:24:48,287
LAURA: He was a sailor! That's how I met him!

1382
01:24:48,287 --> 01:24:50,169
TRAVIS: Well, for a bit.

1383
01:24:50,169 --> 01:24:54,157
MARISHA: Wow, that's pretty cool.

1384
01:24:54,157 --> 01:24:55,634
LIAM: How long was that for?

1385
01:24:55,634 --> 01:24:57,243
TRAVIS: Few years.

1386
01:24:57,243 --> 01:25:02,859
LAURA: As soon as Caleb looks up, I look in his
book. What is your book about?

1387
01:25:02,859 --> 01:25:08,227
LIAM: Oh, this is about grumpkins and
periwinkles.

1388
01:25:08,227 --> 01:25:11,153
LAURA: (gasps) Those are my favorite!

1389
01:25:11,153 --> 01:25:12,494
LIAM: What is a periwinkle?

1390
01:25:12,494 --> 01:25:14,360
LAURA: Are there drawings of them?

1391
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:18,808
LIAM: Occasional drawings. There's no penises
drawn in this book so I don't think you'd be

1392
01:25:18,808 --> 01:25:20,231
interested.

1393
01:25:20,231 --> 01:25:21,852
TALIESIN: Any toad creatures?

1394
01:25:21,852 --> 01:25:29,663
MATT: You do find one interesting tidbit of
information that piques your interest.

1395
01:25:29,663 --> 01:25:33,092
SAM: Ooh, he has it written down? On a thing?

1396
01:25:33,092 --> 01:25:35,520
TALIESIN: Oh, the first piece of paper of the
game!

1397
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:38,384
MARISHA: What's it say?

1398
01:25:38,384 --> 01:25:41,194
MATT: If he decides he wants to share, it's up to
him.

1399
01:25:41,194 --> 01:25:43,513
LIAM: Leave me alone, I'm reading.

1400
01:25:43,513 --> 01:25:47,132
MARISHA: Caleb, we're bored! Tell us a story!

1401
01:25:47,132 --> 01:25:51,981
LIAM: I need 20 actual seconds to see what the
piece of paper says!

1402
01:25:51,981 --> 01:25:55,395
TALIESIN: Have you read it now? What's it say?

1403
01:25:55,395 --> 01:26:01,721
SAM: So Fjord, you're very acquainted with seamen
then? Having been on the water for so long?

1404
01:26:01,721 --> 01:26:06,112
TRAVIS: Sure am! Yep.

1405
01:26:06,112 --> 01:26:07,888
MARISHA: Have you heard that joke a lot?

1406
01:26:07,888 --> 01:26:13,558
TRAVIS: I have. It gets funnier every time, though,
I got to say. It's all in the delivery.

1407
01:26:13,558 --> 01:26:18,438
LAURA: He laughed at it the first 20 times I
said it to him.

1408
01:26:18,438 --> 01:26:28,471
MARISHA: So wait, do you seamen have cloisters in
Trostenwald?

1409
01:26:28,471 --> 01:26:32,411
SAM: Are there clusters of seamen around you at
all times?

1410
01:26:32,411 --> 01:26:41,612
TRAVIS: Is it too early in the campaign to walk
away? And I fucking saunter away.

1411
01:26:41,612 --> 01:26:47,979
SAM: And I saunter away. I mosy away.

1412
01:26:48,033 --> 01:26:53,352
(laughter)

1413
01:26:53,352 --> 01:26:59,227
MATT: As Fjord slowly walks away from the table,
not engaging with your comedic advances.

1414
01:26:59,227 --> 01:27:03,830
LIAM: Do I remember people talking about
nightmares from the past couple of days? Not Liam,

1415
01:27:03,830 --> 01:27:05,148
but Caleb?

1416
01:27:05,148 --> 01:27:07,701
MATT: No, you didn't inquire or question.

1417
01:27:07,701 --> 01:27:09,753
LIAM: Okay, and I didn't overhear, okay.

1418
01:27:09,753 --> 01:27:12,896
LAURA: What does it say?

1419
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:21,207
LIAM: I mean, it's chock-a-block with a lot of
things, most of it probably untrue and stories to

1420
01:27:21,207 --> 01:27:32,254
scare your children, but there is some sort of
demon that is described as being fat and rotund,

1421
01:27:32,254 --> 01:27:37,665
and it talks about-- I mean, this is too
coincidental, it can't be the thing that we're--

1422
01:27:37,665 --> 01:27:41,948
what are the odds of something being in this book,
and it's what we're chasing today? But this is

1423
01:27:41,948 --> 01:27:57,191
describing some sort of scaled demon that feeds on
people in the night, when they're sleeping, and it

1424
01:27:57,191 --> 01:28:03,496
leaves corrupted, undead corpses behind, known as
husks.

1425
01:28:03,496 --> 01:28:07,171
LAURA: That is what they look like. They look like
husks!

1426
01:28:07,171 --> 01:28:08,760
MARISHA: They did look like husks.

1427
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:10,789
TRAVIS: And we didn't see anybody it fed on.

1428
01:28:10,789 --> 01:28:14,824
LIAM: Does this book-- is it of this town, or?

1429
01:28:14,824 --> 01:28:17,893
MATT: Oh no, it's a general book about--

1430
01:28:17,893 --> 01:28:19,500
LIAM: General book, could be anywhere.

1431
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:24,531
MATT: Anywhere, anything, it doesn't even mention
locations. It's just, "This is some lore about

1432
01:28:24,531 --> 01:28:26,205
"devils and demons!"

1433
01:28:26,205 --> 01:28:36,216
TALIESIN: Kylre's been around for a while, though!
And this is new, right? I feel like-- Was there nothing?

1434
01:28:36,216 --> 01:28:38,222
TRAVIS: How well did you know Kylre?

1435
01:28:38,222 --> 01:28:41,403
TALIESIN: I mean, not that well. Of everybody, the
least.

1436
01:28:41,403 --> 01:28:44,310
LIAM: You haven't heard the word nergaliid?

1437
01:28:44,310 --> 01:28:47,601
TALIESIN: That's a--

1438
01:28:47,601 --> 01:28:53,302
MATT: As soon as he says that, it triggers
something in your brain, and that thought you had

1439
01:28:53,302 --> 01:28:59,393
the other night clicks. Like, that's what it was
that was escaping you. Nergaliid.

1440
01:28:59,393 --> 01:29:01,995
TALIESIN: I have heard that word before.

1441
01:29:01,995 --> 01:29:04,752
LIAM: Because that's what I'm talking about here.

1442
01:29:04,752 --> 01:29:12,430
TALIESIN: Oh dear. Oh, why can't I remember? It
was so long ago.

1443
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:20,762
MARISHA: Okay, so what was Mr. Frogman's diet?

1444
01:29:20,762 --> 01:29:23,587
TRAVIS: Yeah, what did he feast on?

1445
01:29:23,587 --> 01:29:25,135
TALIESIN: What did he eat?

1446
01:29:25,135 --> 01:29:26,769
MATT: He ate what was given to him.

1447
01:29:26,769 --> 01:29:28,847
TALIESIN: He ate what we had!

1448
01:29:28,847 --> 01:29:34,955
MATT: He seemed like a lizard man, from what you
knew and experienced. He thought it was fine.

1449
01:29:34,955 --> 01:29:36,728
There was no draw to it.

1450
01:29:36,728 --> 01:29:39,207
LAURA: You never noticed him eating people before?

1451
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:44,935
TALIESIN: I feel like I would've taken note of it.
I don't necessarily know I would've commented on

1452
01:29:44,935 --> 01:29:46,585
it, but I would've noted it.

1453
01:29:46,585 --> 01:29:47,523
LAURA: Okay.

1454
01:29:47,523 --> 01:29:48,588
TALIESIN: And it was not noted.

1455
01:29:48,588 --> 01:29:52,704
LIAM: Once again, I have no idea if this is the
creature that we're in pursuit of, but this talks

1456
01:29:52,704 --> 01:29:59,188
about it not eating food, but siphoning the life
off of mortal creatures, but not to the point of

1457
01:29:59,188 --> 01:30:05,019
death or harming them. They might not even notice
that it's happening.

1458
01:30:05,019 --> 01:30:06,478
TALIESIN: Oh no.

1459
01:30:06,478 --> 01:30:10,304
LAURA: (gasps) That's what was happening to Toya.
Maybe all of you.

1460
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:19,074
LIAM: It says that this thing has two types of
feeding: one is slow and unnoticeable, maybe, and

1461
01:30:19,074 --> 01:30:23,326
one is quick with much pain and anguish.

1462
01:30:23,326 --> 01:30:25,687
LAURA: Does it say anything about it hiding in
water?

1463
01:30:25,687 --> 01:30:27,712
LIAM: No.

1464
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:31,324
LAURA: Does it say anything about it liking the
sound of song?

1465
01:30:31,324 --> 01:30:33,331
LIAM: It does not.

1466
01:30:33,331 --> 01:30:38,611
LAURA: Is it related at all to the periwinkles you
were talking about before?

1467
01:30:38,611 --> 01:30:46,174
TALIESIN: It's not possible he's trying to head
back to Xhorhas, is it? I said out loud.

1468
01:30:46,174 --> 01:30:50,836
TRAVIS: I think we saw both the fast and the
slow feeding methods.

1469
01:30:50,836 --> 01:30:52,968
TALIESIN: Kylre was not a talker.

1470
01:30:52,968 --> 01:30:55,963
LAURA: Does it say how to kill it?

1471
01:30:55,963 --> 01:30:58,703
TRAVIS: Yeah, weaknesses? Vulnerabilities?

1472
01:30:58,703 --> 01:31:00,312
TALIESIN: Stabbing?

1473
01:31:00,312 --> 01:31:11,016
LAURA: Well, most fiends are weak to holy damage,
right?

1474
01:31:11,016 --> 01:31:14,125
MATT: Make a religion check.

1475
01:31:14,125 --> 01:31:18,509
TALIESIN: Can I also do this? I'm thinking about
everything I hear.

1476
01:31:18,509 --> 01:31:20,603
MATT: Sure, I'll let you roll for it.

1477
01:31:20,603 --> 01:31:26,162
SAM: They have a vulnerability to poppyseed
muffins.

1478
01:31:26,162 --> 01:31:27,172
TALIESIN: Nine.

1479
01:31:27,172 --> 01:31:28,426
LAURA: 14.

1480
01:31:28,426 --> 01:31:36,969
MATT: You don't get the idea that most devils or
demons have a vulnerability to radiant or holy

1481
01:31:36,969 --> 01:31:41,911
damage. Some might, some don't, but you're
unable to take a bead on this. The book you have

1482
01:31:41,911 --> 01:31:47,213
is informative from an encyclopedia standpoint.
It's sort of storytelling and an informative

1483
01:31:47,213 --> 01:31:50,663
thing, but it's not a catalog about all the
aspects and details of each creature.

1484
01:31:50,663 --> 01:31:57,898
LIAM: Right, it's a kid's Encyclopedia Britannica,
and scanning through, I saw one thing that popped out.

1485
01:31:57,898 --> 01:31:59,712
MATT: Yeah, you were like, wait.

1486
01:31:59,712 --> 01:32:06,996
LIAM: May I ask with my intelligence score of 18
and the Keen Mind feat, could we say that Caleb is

1487
01:32:06,996 --> 01:32:08,714
a speed reader?

1488
01:32:08,714 --> 01:32:16,099
MATT: In comparison to some, maybe. You're not
Johnny Five-style, I know kung-fu.

1489
01:32:16,099 --> 01:32:19,552
LIAM: Believably, not magic.

1490
01:32:19,552 --> 01:32:24,065
MATT: Yeah, you can read pretty quick, let's say.
You spend a lot of time by yourself reading.

1491
01:32:24,065 --> 01:32:26,481
LAURA: "Reading."

1492
01:32:26,481 --> 01:32:28,237
LIAM: Good times.

1493
01:32:28,237 --> 01:32:30,120
TRAVIS: In the bathroom.

1494
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:32,657
TALIESIN: Clusters of semen all around you.

1495
01:32:32,657 --> 01:32:38,960
LIAM: It was still funny when it was just implied.
You can paint it across the wall.

1496
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:41,415
TALIESIN: Always funny. Always.

1497
01:32:41,415 --> 01:32:44,834
LIAM: We're talking about masturbation.

1498
01:32:44,834 --> 01:32:47,952
SAM: Jerking off.

1499
01:32:47,952 --> 01:32:54,039
(laughter)

1500
01:32:54,039 --> 01:32:56,873
LIAM: Would you say that Caleb is a speed-beater?

1501
01:32:56,873 --> 01:33:00,272
SAM: Roll for spanking.

1502
01:33:00,272 --> 01:33:02,370
MATT: From the window to the wall.

1503
01:33:02,370 --> 01:33:04,677
(laughter and groaning)

1504
01:33:04,677 --> 01:33:14,705
MATT: As you guys are having this discussion, the
two guards that had come in earlier come through

1505
01:33:14,705 --> 01:33:19,265
the main door earlier than the three hours you had
anticipated with another guard in tow. As they

1506
01:33:19,265 --> 01:33:26,300
rush in they glance around the room and see you
and make a beeline to your table in a very huffed

1507
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:34,353
bit of energy. They say, "You are absolved of
meeting this afternoon. We'll pick this up

1508
01:33:34,353 --> 01:33:35,446
"tomorrow."

1509
01:33:35,446 --> 01:33:36,367
LAURA: What's going on?

1510
01:33:36,367 --> 01:33:37,532
TALIESIN: Wait, what?

1511
01:33:37,532 --> 01:33:44,922
MATT: "There have been a series of murders within
the Crownsguard that we are investigating as well.

1512
01:33:44,922 --> 01:33:51,141
"This will be part of the investigation tomorrow,
you are not to leave this inn."

1513
01:33:51,141 --> 01:33:56,491
LAURA: But we could help. Obviously, we had nothing to
do with it if people are hurt outside and we were

1514
01:33:56,491 --> 01:33:58,134
here the whole time.

1515
01:33:58,134 --> 01:34:01,944
MARISHA: How are we absolved yet we still have to
be locked in this inn?

1516
01:34:01,944 --> 01:34:06,627
MATT: "You are absolved of it today. We're still
going to come by tomorrow and have you questioned.

1517
01:34:06,627 --> 01:34:10,044
"We've arrested Ornna and we have members of the
carnival that have fled that we're currently

1518
01:34:10,044 --> 01:34:11,512
"seeking at the moment."

1519
01:34:11,512 --> 01:34:15,820
MARISHA: You should pick better words next time
that are slightly more clear.

1520
01:34:15,820 --> 01:34:21,666
MATT: "We'll return tomorrow." They leave in a
frustrated huff.

1521
01:34:21,666 --> 01:34:24,976
TRAVIS: Well, our day just got freed up.

1522
01:34:24,976 --> 01:34:28,511
SAM: But they still said we couldn't leave.

1523
01:34:28,511 --> 01:34:32,182
TALIESIN: You could read that other book, at the
very least.

1524
01:34:32,182 --> 01:34:39,608
LIAM: I could. I could also-- here's the thing
about my cat. He's a cat, definitely a cat, but is

1525
01:34:39,608 --> 01:34:45,727
also a fey creature. If I have an hour, he doesn't
have to be a cat. He can temporarily be a bird.

1526
01:34:45,727 --> 01:34:48,642
LAURA: How much did you say it costs, though?

1527
01:34:48,642 --> 01:34:51,655
LIAM: Well, I have a lot of charcoal now, and you
said you have incense on you?

1528
01:34:51,655 --> 01:34:56,930
TALIESIN: I go into my bag and I've got some old,
weird-- I've got a weird little--

1529
01:34:56,930 --> 01:35:01,539
MATT: You've got about eight silvers worth of
incense, and that's a lot.

1530
01:35:01,539 --> 01:35:09,968
TALIESIN: It's in a very strange, ornate bag
that's covered in strange gems and weird filigree.

1531
01:35:09,968 --> 01:35:12,683
SAM: Does Molly always smell of patchouli?

1532
01:35:12,683 --> 01:35:19,145
TALIESIN: Sandalwood. It's nag champa all over.

1533
01:35:19,145 --> 01:35:22,183
MATT: It's masking the faint scent of horse dung.

1534
01:35:22,183 --> 01:35:27,365
SAM: What else do you need?

1535
01:35:27,365 --> 01:35:32,622
LIAM: Let it all out. Go for it. Don't hold back.

1536
01:35:32,622 --> 01:35:35,626
TRAVIS: Are you sure you want to do this, with
your cat?

1537
01:35:35,626 --> 01:35:42,538
LIAM: Yes. I prefer him as a cat, to be honest,
but in a pinch.

1538
01:35:42,538 --> 01:35:45,524
TRAVIS: Anything else besides a bird? I mean, any
kind of creature?

1539
01:35:45,524 --> 01:35:50,390
LIAM: Well, not any kind of creature, but I've made
him an octopus once. There was this one time when

1540
01:35:50,390 --> 01:35:56,072
Nott was very high up in a burning building and we
had no way to get her down.

1541
01:35:56,072 --> 01:36:04,323
SAM: I jumped on to the octopus and it served as
some sort of a landing pad. It killed the octopus,

1542
01:36:04,323 --> 01:36:05,897
but I lived.

1543
01:36:05,897 --> 01:36:08,546
LAURA: Octopuses are very smart.

1544
01:36:08,546 --> 01:36:10,304
LIAM: I think it's octopi.

1545
01:36:10,304 --> 01:36:12,818
LAURA: I didn't say I was very smart.

1546
01:36:12,818 --> 01:36:14,548
TALIESIN: Enough about the pastries already.

1547
01:36:14,625 --> 01:36:18,671
TRAVIS: It can be killed is an important thing to
know. I only mean, if it's important to you,

1548
01:36:18,671 --> 01:36:22,258
in a moment of danger I would try to save it, but
if that's not important.

1549
01:36:22,258 --> 01:36:29,498
LIAM: It can be pricey to keep bringing him back
and all that, but he-- no, you can't kill him.

1550
01:36:29,498 --> 01:36:31,393
TRAVIS: Fair enough. That's very impressive.

1551
01:36:31,393 --> 01:36:33,036
SAM: I've tried.

1552
01:36:33,036 --> 01:36:35,060
LIAM: She's eaten him twice.

1553
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:37,704
SAM: I was very hungry.

1554
01:36:37,704 --> 01:36:46,949
LIAM: I will need about an hour of time; I'll probably 
head upstairs. Do you have a pot I could borrow?

1555
01:36:46,949 --> 01:36:52,156
MATT: Yorda is currently in the process of sitting
down and checking something underneath the bar and

1556
01:36:52,156 --> 01:36:53,849
goes, "I'm sorry, what was that?"

1557
01:36:53,849 --> 01:36:58,095
LIAM: I was hoping you had an iron pot I could
borrow for-- never mind, I'll use the piss pot.

1558
01:36:58,095 --> 01:37:00,208
I'll borrow this.

1559
01:37:00,208 --> 01:37:02,041
TALIESIN: Yes, of course.

1560
01:37:02,041 --> 01:37:04,807
LIAM: Is this enough to jury-rig?

1561
01:37:04,807 --> 01:37:06,323
MATT: How much is the--

1562
01:37:06,323 --> 01:37:07,868
LIAM: It's ten gold.

1563
01:37:07,868 --> 01:37:09,786
MATT: No, you're going to need to go out and buy
some.

1564
01:37:09,786 --> 01:37:11,118
LIAM: That's why I asked.

1565
01:37:11,118 --> 01:37:12,540
SAM: Buy some, what, incense?

1566
01:37:12,540 --> 01:37:17,462
LIAM: Okay, this is a joke. I need to actually go
to the incense store.

1567
01:37:17,462 --> 01:37:19,815
LAURA: Get ten gold worth of incense?

1568
01:37:19,815 --> 01:37:23,122
LIAM: Charcoal and incense, yeah. 
For this plan to work.

1569
01:37:23,177 --> 01:37:25,828
MATT: There is the remedy store that you've seen
before, and that would be the place to have

1570
01:37:25,828 --> 01:37:27,829
incense and/or herbal type.

1571
01:37:27,829 --> 01:37:34,226
SAM: I've been to one of these places, it's called
Natural Remedies. Herbs and medicinal things. It's

1572
01:37:34,226 --> 01:37:35,773
up the street a bit.

1573
01:37:35,773 --> 01:37:38,074
LIAM: Do you have ten gold?

1574
01:37:38,074 --> 01:37:41,771
SAM: Maybe.

1575
01:37:41,771 --> 01:37:43,679
TRAVIS: I have ten gold.

1576
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:45,641
LAURA: You're going through gold very quickly.

1577
01:37:45,641 --> 01:37:49,565
SAM: Or I could sneak in and grab it for you.

1578
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:51,243
LAURA: I could help you.

1579
01:37:51,243 --> 01:37:52,723
SAM: That sounds fun.

1580
01:37:52,723 --> 01:37:58,654
LIAM: We're still in trouble with the law. I don't
want to push that. If we have the gold, that's the

1581
01:37:58,654 --> 01:37:59,941
safest path.

1582
01:37:59,941 --> 01:38:03,863
TALIESIN: I'm in for a penny. I'm going to throw
a gold in there as well.

1583
01:38:03,942 --> 01:38:08,266
MATT: All right, so you have ten gold between you:
nine from Fjord, and one from Molly.

1584
01:38:08,266 --> 01:38:12,227
LAURA: Okay, I'll put one in, then you have only
eight.

1585
01:38:12,227 --> 01:38:16,503
MATT: Okay, so eight off. All right, you have the
gold. We'll say for the purposes of expediency,

1586
01:38:16,503 --> 01:38:22,529
it's easy enough to go and purchase the necessary
incense and it's quite a bit. For the purposes of

1587
01:38:22,529 --> 01:38:26,859
this ritual, which you've done before, it's quite
a cluster you have to assemble for this. The

1588
01:38:26,859 --> 01:38:29,383
chalk's amassed, the other materials you need for
it.

1589
01:38:29,383 --> 01:38:35,135
TALIESIN: I just saw Jester open her purse.
Dear--!

1590
01:38:35,135 --> 01:38:48,219
LIAM: Brain wipe. I'm going to go up to my room and it takes
me an hour to do this. An hour and ten minutes to

1591
01:38:48,219 --> 01:38:50,462
be exact. I put the--

1592
01:38:50,462 --> 01:38:53,639
TALIESIN: The ten minutes is clean-up.

1593
01:38:53,639 --> 01:39:02,320
(laughter)

1594
01:39:02,397 --> 01:39:08,986
LIAM: Look at the dungeon master. Is that maybe
the longest facepalm?

1595
01:39:08,986 --> 01:39:12,927
MATT: I don't know, you guys have made me facepalm
pretty long before.

1596
01:39:12,927 --> 01:39:15,988
LIAM: I go upstairs to cast "Find Familiar".

1597
01:39:15,988 --> 01:39:19,189
MARISHA: Oh, you found him!

1598
01:39:19,189 --> 01:39:20,876
MATT: What form?

1599
01:39:20,876 --> 01:39:22,466
LIAM: A sparrow.

1600
01:39:22,466 --> 01:39:28,984
MATT: As you finish the concentration, the cat
form shimmers and condenses into this tiny little

1601
01:39:28,984 --> 01:39:35,995
cluster of coal before it sprouts wings and you
glance on your shoulder. (whistles)

1602
01:39:35,995 --> 01:39:41,218
LIAM: I'm sorry, I know this is not your preferred
form, but it is only temporary until I get ten

1603
01:39:41,218 --> 01:39:43,871
more gold. Let's go down and get some breakfast.

1604
01:39:43,871 --> 01:39:49,018
MATT: You guys, after waiting patiently and
talking amongst yourselves, Caleb reemerges with a

1605
01:39:49,018 --> 01:39:51,034
tiny sparrow.

1606
01:39:51,034 --> 01:39:57,000
LIAM: There he is. He lands on Molly's horn.

1607
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,181
LAURA: Damn it. Right here?

1608
01:39:59,181 --> 01:40:00,646
LIAM: On his horn, yes.

1609
01:40:00,646 --> 01:40:01,959
TALIESIN: Go ahead.

1610
01:40:01,959 --> 01:40:06,050
LAURA: This is the lumpiest little bird I've ever
seen.

1611
01:40:06,050 --> 01:40:08,961
MARISHA: Is his name still Frumpkin, it's just a
bird now?

1612
01:40:08,961 --> 01:40:10,536
LIAM: Always Frumpkin, yeah.

1613
01:40:10,536 --> 01:40:12,947
TALIESIN: He's a little feathery Frumpkin.

1614
01:40:12,947 --> 01:40:17,716
LIAM: He flits over to Jester's horn. Takes a
dump.

1615
01:40:17,716 --> 01:40:23,597
LAURA: I feel so special and blessed, you guys.

1616
01:40:23,597 --> 01:40:25,146
TALIESIN: You look like a princess.

1617
01:40:25,146 --> 01:40:26,451
LAURA: Thank you.

1618
01:40:26,451 --> 01:40:32,008
LIAM: He stays there for the time being. Is this
what we're doing? I can't go anywhere, I'm going

1619
01:40:32,008 --> 01:40:39,524
to be blind and deaf, I have to stay still and
safe. Try not hit me in the head with too many

1620
01:40:39,524 --> 01:40:43,320
things. It'll take a while, but he will go off.

1621
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:49,771
TRAVIS: Well, if you'd like, you could stay at the
inn, or we could acquire that boat and once you're

1622
01:40:49,771 --> 01:40:53,219
on board we could send it out as a sort of a
recon.

1623
01:40:53,219 --> 01:40:54,993
LIAM: That's true as well.

1624
01:40:54,993 --> 01:41:01,589
SAM: Do sparrows see in the dark? They're daytime
birds.

1625
01:41:01,589 --> 01:41:04,664
TRAVIS: It is daytime right now, it would require
us leaving now.

1626
01:41:04,664 --> 01:41:06,724
SAM: We should do this quickly before the light
goes away, right?

1627
01:41:06,724 --> 01:41:10,824
TALIESIN: Well, if we can send the sparrow out, we
can carry him with us if he finds anything.

1628
01:41:10,824 --> 01:41:13,581
LIAM: I could have done a bat, but it's too late
for that now.

1629
01:41:13,581 --> 01:41:14,709
TRAVIS: A what?

1630
01:41:14,709 --> 01:41:15,869
LIAM: A bat.

1631
01:41:15,869 --> 01:41:21,439
TRAVIS: We should take advantage of the daytime.
Out the windows as we did before?

1632
01:41:21,439 --> 01:41:25,757
TALIESIN: Let's let the sparrow see if it can find
anything. Then we know which direction we have to

1633
01:41:25,757 --> 01:41:28,306
head into so there's not too much meandering
about.

1634
01:41:28,306 --> 01:41:30,299
MARISHA: Yeah, can we hunker down here while--

1635
01:41:30,299 --> 01:41:32,529
TALIESIN: Until there's a direction to go.

1636
01:41:32,529 --> 01:41:34,084
TRAVIS: Perhaps we should go upstairs--

1637
01:41:34,084 --> 01:41:36,955
MATT: You can only see through Frumpkin's eyes for
up to a 100-foot radius.

1638
01:41:36,955 --> 01:41:41,161
LIAM: I thought we talked about this. You told
me-- and if you need to change it, change it-- But

1639
01:41:41,161 --> 01:41:46,474
that I can only control him telepathically up to
100 feet, but could continue to see.

1640
01:41:46,474 --> 01:41:47,827
MATT: Let me double-check.

1641
01:41:47,827 --> 01:41:50,333
LIAM: I'm happy whatever your ruling is, but
that's how we've done it.

1642
01:41:50,416 --> 01:41:52,696
MATT: I have to recall the specifics, I may have
confused--

1643
01:41:52,696 --> 01:41:57,661
TRAVIS: If that's the case, we'll get the boat. If
not, we'll let drone sparrow activate.

1644
01:41:57,661 --> 01:41:59,372
LIAM: That's what I based this whole plan on.

1645
01:41:59,372 --> 01:42:01,558
LAURA: Do we have to get in disguise again in
order to leave?

1646
01:42:01,558 --> 01:42:05,574
TRAVIS: We could try to go out the side of the
windows. It is daytime.

1647
01:42:05,574 --> 01:42:07,592
LIAM: The wording was a little squirrely.

1648
01:42:07,592 --> 01:42:13,865
MATT: The wording is a little squirrely. Yeah, you
cannot communicate with it telepathically, but you

1649
01:42:13,865 --> 01:42:15,970
could technically still see through its eyes, I
suppose.

1650
01:42:15,970 --> 01:42:22,642
LIAM: So I can give him the command up close to
go, but if anything happens I can't improvise with

1651
01:42:22,642 --> 01:42:25,537
him. He does what the command is.

1652
01:42:25,537 --> 01:42:27,118
MATT: Right. What's the command?

1653
01:42:27,118 --> 01:42:34,221
LIAM: To fly north to the island and circle it a
few times to see what we can see and come back.

1654
01:42:34,221 --> 01:42:39,412
MATT: All right. As you go up to the window and
release Frumpkin--

1655
01:42:39,412 --> 01:42:43,644
TRAVIS: Can we say we're doing this from one of
our rooms?

1656
01:42:43,644 --> 01:42:47,344
LIAM: We gather in Fjord and Molly's room.

1657
01:42:47,344 --> 01:42:56,831
MATT: It's curious, when Caleb is focusing, the
pupils go to a very faint sky blue. You see

1658
01:42:56,831 --> 01:43:01,121
flickering in them, though you cannot make any
imagery out of it, it's just the strange movement

1659
01:43:01,121 --> 01:43:02,897
within the pupil.

1660
01:43:02,897 --> 01:43:04,953
TRAVIS: Yep, there's that bullshit again.

1661
01:43:04,953 --> 01:43:08,088
LAURA: He can't communicate with us when he's like
this?

1662
01:43:08,088 --> 01:43:12,298
TRAVIS: He talks. He will talk to you out of the
fucking blue.

1663
01:43:12,298 --> 01:43:16,750
LAURA: Can he feel if we touch him? I poke him in
the forehead.

1664
01:43:16,750 --> 01:43:17,815
LIAM: Ow.

1665
01:43:17,815 --> 01:43:18,984
LAURA: Oh, okay.

1666
01:43:18,984 --> 01:43:21,171
LIAM: Don't do that, please, I'm trying to
concentrate.

1667
01:43:21,171 --> 01:43:25,627
LAURA: Can he tell who did it?

1668
01:43:25,627 --> 01:43:27,217
SAM: No, he can't see you.

1669
01:43:27,217 --> 01:43:29,708
LAURA: That's wonderful.

1670
01:43:29,708 --> 01:43:32,782
SAM: But I will tell him later when he asks.

1671
01:43:32,782 --> 01:43:35,684
LAURA: Well, okay, but he won't know now.

1672
01:43:35,684 --> 01:43:43,671
MATT: As you concentrate, the bird's-eye view of
Trostenwald-- Frumpkin carries up high into the

1673
01:43:43,671 --> 01:43:48,973
air. For the large lake that it is, you can see
two smaller land masses in the center of the lake.

1674
01:43:48,973 --> 01:43:52,522
Technically not north from where you are now,
since you're back in the city, it's more of a

1675
01:43:52,522 --> 01:44:01,036
northeastern direction. They're both relatively
small, one's maybe a few hundred feet across,

1676
01:44:01,111 --> 01:44:09,233
another one is maybe 50 feet across. It's a
smaller mass. Watching as it coasts downward and

1677
01:44:09,233 --> 01:44:13,958
does a pass over the larger one, make a perception
check for Frumpkin.

1678
01:44:13,958 --> 01:44:21,388
LIAM: That is a six plus very little or nothing,
so you can guesstimate.

1679
01:44:21,388 --> 01:44:32,814
MATT: There is a faint treeline on this island.
The island has a few small trees, which is mainly

1680
01:44:32,814 --> 01:44:39,505
what you had seen during the night when you looked
out over the water, Beauregard. The land mass was

1681
01:44:39,505 --> 01:44:44,502
actually the very top of this tree line. It's a
small grove that has clustered there on the center

1682
01:44:44,502 --> 01:44:49,938
of this island. Unable to make out any other
details other than the tops of these trees and

1683
01:44:49,938 --> 01:44:59,517
there's a few spots in between where you can see
overgrown grass and general ground, rock.

1684
01:44:59,517 --> 01:45:00,696
LIAM: This is the bigger one?

1685
01:45:00,696 --> 01:45:03,446
MATT: The bigger one, yeah. Make a perception
check for the smaller one.

1686
01:45:03,446 --> 01:45:07,177
LIAM: Worse. Five.

1687
01:45:07,177 --> 01:45:14,586
MATT: The other one has maybe five or six trees on
it, but most of them appear to have either died or

1688
01:45:14,586 --> 01:45:20,925
be standing alone on this small mass. That one
looks pretty barren. Even with as bad of a look as

1689
01:45:20,925 --> 01:45:25,238
that was, it doesn't look like there's anything
visible on that land mass.

1690
01:45:25,238 --> 01:45:27,323
LIAM: Does it look balder than the other?

1691
01:45:27,323 --> 01:45:28,236
MATT: It does.

1692
01:45:28,236 --> 01:45:29,332
LIAM: Okay.

1693
01:45:29,332 --> 01:45:32,256
MATT: The larger one has much more of a cluster, a
grove.

1694
01:45:32,256 --> 01:45:37,287
LIAM: Last question, I can probably tell how far
apart these two islands are, yeah?

1695
01:45:37,287 --> 01:45:45,656
MATT: Yeah, they're roughly 600 feet apart from
each other.

1696
01:45:45,656 --> 01:45:47,478
LIAM: 600, okay.

1697
01:45:47,478 --> 01:45:54,674
SAM: We're all sitting around in this room,
watching him watch TV, essentially.

1698
01:45:54,674 --> 01:45:56,232
MATT: Yes, basically.

1699
01:45:56,232 --> 01:46:07,329
SAM: While this is going on, can I whip out my
little chemistry kit and start putting together

1700
01:46:07,329 --> 01:46:09,714
some chemical stuff?

1701
01:46:09,714 --> 01:46:11,261
MATT: Sure, what would you like to make?

1702
01:46:11,261 --> 01:46:12,705
SAM: Acid.

1703
01:46:12,705 --> 01:46:17,607
MATT: Okay. It requires half a day to make that.

1704
01:46:17,607 --> 01:46:19,236
SAM: I'll start it, then.

1705
01:46:19,236 --> 01:46:20,456
MATT: Okay.

1706
01:46:20,456 --> 01:46:23,067
SAM: Get in an hour of work.

1707
01:46:23,067 --> 01:46:24,472
MATT: Okay.

1708
01:46:24,472 --> 01:46:32,859
MARISHA: While she's doing that, I'm going to 
take my staff and repair where it cracked.

1709
01:46:32,859 --> 01:46:34,597
MATT: That's easy enough.

1710
01:46:34,597 --> 01:46:36,079
LAURA: I'm going to braid Caleb's hair.

1711
01:46:36,079 --> 01:46:38,361
MATT: Okay.

1712
01:46:38,361 --> 01:46:40,696
LIAM: I feel that.

1713
01:46:40,696 --> 01:46:41,966
LAURA: I know.

1714
01:46:41,966 --> 01:46:43,657
LIAM: And it feels good.

1715
01:46:43,657 --> 01:46:48,039
SAM: We talking just one braid? French braid?

1716
01:46:48,039 --> 01:46:52,342
LAURA: Like a few little braids, because his hair
is not super long. Maybe one here, one here, and

1717
01:46:52,342 --> 01:46:53,867
one down here.

1718
01:46:53,867 --> 01:46:56,318
LIAM: You can't make me Vax again, it won't work.

1719
01:46:56,318 --> 01:46:59,309
MATT: Make an intelligence check, adding your
proficiency modifier.

1720
01:46:59,309 --> 01:47:00,503
SAM: One.

1721
01:47:00,503 --> 01:47:02,715
(laughter)

1722
01:47:02,715 --> 01:47:03,789
TRAVIS: You kill us all.

1723
01:47:03,789 --> 01:47:05,658
TALIESIN: Play-Doh, we've got Play-Doh.

1724
01:47:05,658 --> 01:47:16,684
MATT: For the supplies that you've spent-- You've
used your one set of acid supplies you had on you,

1725
01:47:16,684 --> 01:47:23,242
so you'll have to buy more to make it again. As
you begin to make it, it becomes caustic and

1726
01:47:23,242 --> 01:47:28,516
begins to melt through part of your glove. You
immediately freak out, you drop it, and it hits

1727
01:47:28,516 --> 01:47:35,072
the wood. Splatters a bit and begins to melt
through the wood.

1728
01:47:35,072 --> 01:47:37,982
SAM: Sorry. I didn't mean to, I was--

1729
01:47:37,982 --> 01:47:41,034
LAURA: (gasps) Now we can spy on the people below
us.

1730
01:47:41,034 --> 01:47:43,826
SAM: It didn't go through the entire floor, I
don't think.

1731
01:47:43,826 --> 01:47:46,282
TALIESIN: Well, we're not going to get our deposit
back.

1732
01:47:46,282 --> 01:47:51,040
SAM: We'll move the nightstand over a little to
cover it up. No one will see.

1733
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:53,329
MARISHA: Is it slowly eating through the
wood?

1734
01:47:53,329 --> 01:47:57,669
MATT: It is still slowly eating through the wood.

1735
01:47:57,669 --> 01:48:01,070
SAM: I pour some water on it.

1736
01:48:01,070 --> 01:48:05,041
MARISHA: Oh no.

1737
01:48:05,041 --> 01:48:06,997
TALIESIN: That makes it worse.

1738
01:48:06,997 --> 01:48:09,535
SAM: Oh no.

1739
01:48:09,535 --> 01:48:17,260
MATT: Eventually Frumpkin begins to return, having
done Frumpkin's full watch.

1740
01:48:17,260 --> 01:48:22,692
LIAM: When I see that he's halfway back, I come
out of it.

1741
01:48:22,692 --> 01:48:26,143
MATT: You come out of it and the first thing you
see is all of them gathered around this hole in

1742
01:48:26,143 --> 01:48:27,476
the wood.

1743
01:48:27,476 --> 01:48:28,865
LIAM: What are you doing?

1744
01:48:28,865 --> 01:48:30,611
SAM: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Caleb.

1745
01:48:30,611 --> 01:48:35,777
LIAM: I plant my hands on the sides of the wood
and start transmuting it to iron.

1746
01:48:35,777 --> 01:48:39,771
LAURA: Iron? That's not noticeable.

1747
01:48:39,771 --> 01:48:47,501
MATT: As you concentrate, the area and the wood
around where that hole is all of a sudden begins to

1748
01:48:47,501 --> 01:48:53,248
turn darker and more solid. While the texture
remains of wood, suddenly it has the appearance of

1749
01:48:53,248 --> 01:48:56,358
a dull reddish-brown metal.

1750
01:48:56,358 --> 01:49:02,803
SAM: Thank you. We'll mop it up with some towels
and whatnot while it's still iron.

1751
01:49:02,803 --> 01:49:05,203
LIAM: Hopefully it will dry.

1752
01:49:05,203 --> 01:49:08,258
TRAVIS: That is a hell of a talent you have.

1753
01:49:08,258 --> 01:49:09,842
TALIESIN: It's pretty fancy.

1754
01:49:09,842 --> 01:49:12,685
MARISHA: Is that what you did with the coin? Is
this the coin trick?

1755
01:49:12,685 --> 01:49:16,817
SAM: No, the coin was magic. It was a magic pot
that we sold you.

1756
01:49:16,817 --> 01:49:19,877
LAURA: Oh man, I've been concentrating on
skinky-doodles all day.

1757
01:49:19,877 --> 01:49:24,119
SAM: That is your power word.

1758
01:49:24,119 --> 01:49:27,349
LAURA: Man. All right.

1759
01:49:27,349 --> 01:49:28,288
SAM: Sorry.

1760
01:49:28,288 --> 01:49:29,532
LAURA: It's fine.

1761
01:49:29,532 --> 01:49:31,604
MARISHA and SAM: Sorry.

1762
01:49:31,604 --> 01:49:33,403
LIAM: But it brought us closer together.

1763
01:49:33,403 --> 01:49:42,443
SAM: Would you like back the two copper pieces you
gave me for the pot?

1764
01:49:42,493 --> 01:49:48,380
LAURA: No, you keep it. I'm a very generous
person.

1765
01:49:48,380 --> 01:49:51,894
TRAVIS: Can we ask what you saw?

1766
01:49:51,894 --> 01:49:58,320
LIAM: Of course, sorry. Acid. Wood. There are two
islands out there, a bigger one-- they're not

1767
01:49:58,320 --> 01:50:04,300
close-- and a smaller one. One is bald-ish, a
couple of trees, but I couldn't see too well on

1768
01:50:04,300 --> 01:50:11,522
either of them. The bigger one is dense with
trees. I didn't see them.

1769
01:50:11,522 --> 01:50:16,969
LAURA: Did you have it fly down closer so you
could see better?

1770
01:50:16,969 --> 01:50:21,581
LIAM: I thought that he would be able to see from
the air, and I thought that would be safer,

1771
01:50:21,581 --> 01:50:22,708
so no, I'm sorry.

1772
01:50:22,708 --> 01:50:26,289
TRAVIS: Was it busy water, was there lots of
ships out?

1773
01:50:26,289 --> 01:50:28,562
LIAM: I would have seen that.

1774
01:50:28,562 --> 01:50:33,600
MATT: There are some fishing vessels out there,
and there are a number of them that are still at

1775
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:34,868
the docks.

1776
01:50:34,868 --> 01:50:36,356
TRAVIS: It's not a lull for any reason?

1777
01:50:36,356 --> 01:50:37,373
MATT: No.

1778
01:50:37,373 --> 01:50:38,999
LIAM: It's not fleet week.

1779
01:50:38,999 --> 01:50:42,528
LAURA: I guess we should go to the big island?

1780
01:50:42,528 --> 01:50:47,487
LIAM: I think that the chances of finding it on
the big island are greater, yes.

1781
01:50:47,487 --> 01:50:51,830
TRAVIS: Fair enough. Out the window, shall we?

1782
01:50:51,830 --> 01:50:54,225
MARISHA: What time of day is it?

1783
01:50:54,225 --> 01:50:58,294
MATT: By now it's 3:30 in the afternoon, four
o'clock.

1784
01:50:58,294 --> 01:50:59,800
LAURA: Should we wait until dusky-time?

1785
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:04,110
MARISHA: That's what I'm thinking. Wait until
the sun starts to go down? Because it's got to be

1786
01:51:04,163 --> 01:51:05,464
soon at this point.

1787
01:51:05,464 --> 01:51:07,817
MATT: Actually, it's probably closer to five at
the time that you've spent with Frumpkin, so it's

1788
01:51:07,817 --> 01:51:09,682
starting to get closer to dusk.

1789
01:51:09,682 --> 01:51:13,910
LAURA: Okay. Does anybody else want braids in the
amount of time we have to wait?

1790
01:51:13,910 --> 01:51:17,719
MARISHA: Ooh, yeah! Can you give me one going back
this way?

1791
01:51:17,719 --> 01:51:19,963
LAURA: Of course, I can totally do that.

1792
01:51:19,963 --> 01:51:21,278
MARISHA: Thanks.

1793
01:51:21,278 --> 01:51:25,294
TRAVIS: Is anyone else going to be heading out the
front door besides Caleb, Nott, and myself?

1794
01:51:25,294 --> 01:51:28,946
LAURA: I don't want to waste a spell this time.

1795
01:51:28,946 --> 01:51:30,727
TRAVIS: I think that's smart.

1796
01:51:30,727 --> 01:51:33,715
TALIESIN: I'll keep with you.

1797
01:51:33,715 --> 01:51:39,513
LIAM: How far away, roughly, was the edge of the
lake and islands from where we are right now?

1798
01:51:39,513 --> 01:51:48,405
MATT: From where you are right now? I'd say a mile
and a half.

1799
01:51:48,405 --> 01:51:57,383
LIAM: Okay, so while everyone is preparing, I take
out my spool of silver thread and I go first to

1800
01:51:57,383 --> 01:52:02,311
Jester's room, and I stretch the thread across,
and a little (magic flitter sound) flashes across

1801
01:52:02,311 --> 01:52:08,251
and the thread disappears. It takes about ten
minutes each time, and I do the same on Fjord's

1802
01:52:08,251 --> 01:52:15,833
doorway, stretch across (magic flitter sound). If
anyone goes in to these doors besides you, I will

1803
01:52:15,833 --> 01:52:21,829
know, but not when we're on that island. Only on
the way there. Lasts about a mile.

1804
01:52:21,829 --> 01:52:23,319
LAURA: That's awesome!

1805
01:52:23,319 --> 01:52:24,445
TRAVIS: That's great, yeah.

1806
01:52:24,445 --> 01:52:32,188
MARISHA: While we're getting ready, Molly, I don't
know if you unintentionally dodged the question

1807
01:52:32,188 --> 01:52:40,703
last time, or if you didn't hear me, but you never
exactly told us how the circus creates and writes

1808
01:52:40,703 --> 01:52:42,449
their performance acts.

1809
01:52:42,449 --> 01:52:45,731
TALIESIN: I'd forgotten about that.

1810
01:52:45,731 --> 01:52:47,454
MARISHA: Oh, so you did hear me though?

1811
01:52:47,454 --> 01:52:49,621
TALIESIN: We were in the middle of things.

1812
01:52:49,621 --> 01:52:51,860
MARISHA: Just clarifying.

1813
01:52:51,860 --> 01:52:56,525
TALIESIN: It's usually Gustav. If somebody's got
an act, they show it off, Gustav figures out how

1814
01:52:56,525 --> 01:52:58,981
it's going to work into the narrative. Puts it all
together.

1815
01:52:58,981 --> 01:53:00,795
MARISHA: You bring your own narrative?

1816
01:53:00,795 --> 01:53:10,533
TALIESIN: You bring a bit, and then the bit is
shaped and formed by the director of the show. If

1817
01:53:10,533 --> 01:53:16,021
you can do a thing with fire or you can do some
juggling, and then they figure out how that's

1818
01:53:16,021 --> 01:53:22,352
going to work into everything. Where it sits and
what costuming, and the whole thing is all an act.

1819
01:53:22,352 --> 01:53:26,162
Mostly. Mostly an act.

1820
01:53:26,162 --> 01:53:29,047
MARISHA: Did Toya and Kylre come together with
their act?

1821
01:53:29,047 --> 01:53:30,752
LAURA: They came separate.

1822
01:53:30,752 --> 01:53:32,316
MARISHA: They came separate.

1823
01:53:32,316 --> 01:53:40,763
TALIESIN: Oh, you're thinking of Toya and Kylre?
They were an act before-- They were an act for as

1824
01:53:40,763 --> 01:53:42,196
long as I can remember, right?

1825
01:53:42,196 --> 01:53:43,682
MATT: As long as you can remember, yeah.

1826
01:53:43,682 --> 01:53:45,397
TALIESIN: Yeah, I've never not known them as an
act.

1827
01:53:45,397 --> 01:53:52,761
LAURA: I thought when we talked to them they said
that Toya came after Kylre. They joined the circus

1828
01:53:52,761 --> 01:53:54,221
at separate times.

1829
01:53:54,221 --> 01:53:55,889
MARISHA: That's what they told you?

1830
01:53:55,889 --> 01:53:58,837
SAM: When we were investigating, we were--

1831
01:53:58,837 --> 01:54:03,495
LAURA: We gave them a hard-- what was it?

1832
01:54:03,495 --> 01:54:04,781
SAM: Bad Cop.

1833
01:54:04,781 --> 01:54:06,803
LAURA: Yeah, Good Cop. I was the good cop.

1834
01:54:06,803 --> 01:54:08,516
SAM: I was the bad cop!

1835
01:54:08,516 --> 01:54:11,881
LAURA: Yeah, and we got hard information from
them!

1836
01:54:11,881 --> 01:54:15,450
SAM: You're not leaving here without telling us
the truth!

1837
01:54:15,450 --> 01:54:18,245
LAURA: Yeah, and I was like, "Don't worry, she
won't hurt you!"

1838
01:54:18,245 --> 01:54:20,939
SAM: I'm crazy! I'll bite her too!

1839
01:54:20,939 --> 01:54:24,161
LAURA: Then they fessed up to everything!
They were like, "We're a fiend!" and she was like,

1840
01:54:24,161 --> 01:54:25,715
"I'm a little girl!"

1841
01:54:25,715 --> 01:54:27,057
SAM: Yeah, it was crazy.

1842
01:54:27,057 --> 01:54:28,157
LAURA: That was how it went.

1843
01:54:28,157 --> 01:54:29,976
SAM: She confessed to being a little girl.

1844
01:54:29,976 --> 01:54:34,788
LIAM: Do you have any empty positions at the
circus for these two?

1845
01:54:34,788 --> 01:54:38,854
TALIESIN: I'm feeling like maybe that might be a
thing.

1846
01:54:38,854 --> 01:54:42,840
LIAM: Tealeaf, you said, "It's mostly an act."
What's the not-mostly part?

1847
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:50,932
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, everyone's got some weird.
We're weird people. People come in and you're a

1848
01:54:50,932 --> 01:54:52,851
bit strange, you got something you can do.

1849
01:54:52,851 --> 01:54:54,707
LIAM: Are they all swashbuckling swordsmen like
you?

1850
01:54:54,707 --> 01:54:55,636
TALIESIN: No.

1851
01:54:55,636 --> 01:54:57,491
LAURA: Can they all tell fortunes like you?

1852
01:54:57,491 --> 01:54:58,457
TALIESIN: No.

1853
01:54:58,457 --> 01:55:00,633
SAM: Do they cut themselves like you?

1854
01:55:00,633 --> 01:55:03,610
TALIESIN: Well, that's a complicated conversation,
but no.

1855
01:55:03,610 --> 01:55:14,599
MARISHA: You guys are super easy to lie to, no
offense or anything. They lied to them, which means--

1856
01:55:14,599 --> 01:55:16,539
LAURA: No, they didn't lie to us!

1857
01:55:16,539 --> 01:55:18,254
SAM: We meted out the truth!

1858
01:55:18,254 --> 01:55:19,623
LAURA: They told us the truth!

1859
01:55:19,623 --> 01:55:21,264
SAM: We cracked the case wide open!

1860
01:55:21,264 --> 01:55:23,253
TALIESIN: She is a little girl, to be fair.

1861
01:55:23,253 --> 01:55:25,768
LIAM: Nott?

1862
01:55:25,768 --> 01:55:39,720
SAM: Toya. Unless, and here's my new theory: the
big frog man can leech the life force from people?

1863
01:55:39,720 --> 01:55:42,523
LIAM: If that's what it is, yeah.

1864
01:55:42,523 --> 01:55:49,693
SAM: What if Toya is a fully-grown adult woman,
but he's been slowly leeching so much life from

1865
01:55:49,693 --> 01:55:52,165
her that she's a small husk.

1866
01:55:52,165 --> 01:55:54,115
TALIESIN: Toya's not a fully-grown adult woman.

1867
01:55:54,115 --> 01:55:56,510
SAM: She's a tiny full-grown person!

1868
01:55:56,510 --> 01:55:57,901
TALIESIN: She's a dwarf.

1869
01:55:57,901 --> 01:56:06,836
SAM: Oh, she's just a dwarf? Oh, okay, that makes
more sense, actually, when you say it that way. It

1870
01:56:06,836 --> 01:56:09,531
seemed like she was shrunken down from magic!

1871
01:56:09,531 --> 01:56:11,634
TALIESIN: That is so offensive.

1872
01:56:11,634 --> 01:56:16,844
LIAM: Perhaps this girl Toya is his baby's bottle,
and then once in a while he wants an extra snack.

1873
01:56:16,844 --> 01:56:23,969
TALIESIN: I think you're right, but I don't know
how he's managed to go this long. Why now, and why

1874
01:56:23,969 --> 01:56:25,875
in front of all those people?

1875
01:56:25,875 --> 01:56:30,641
LAURA: What if he's like one of those creatures
that lives on the bottom of the sea, and she's not

1876
01:56:30,641 --> 01:56:34,164
actually even a person, she's like this light
thing that dangles in front of--

1877
01:56:34,164 --> 01:56:35,700
SAM: One of his tentacles!

1878
01:56:35,700 --> 01:56:37,003
LAURA: Yeah!

1879
01:56:37,003 --> 01:56:38,887
TRAVIS: He has tentacles now.

1880
01:56:38,887 --> 01:56:41,794
SAM: Not just tentacles, dwarf tentacles!

1881
01:56:41,794 --> 01:56:43,965
LIAM: Fucking anime actors.

1882
01:56:43,965 --> 01:56:48,386
(laughter)

1883
01:56:48,386 --> 01:56:53,514
SAM: Let's go. I think we know all we need to know.

1884
01:56:53,514 --> 01:56:58,060
TALIESIN: I think he is a fiend. I think he is
feeding off her. The rest of it I'm not sure.

1885
01:56:58,060 --> 01:57:04,545
MARISHA: You never noticed Toya acting weird? You
were never like, "Oh, this is a strange--"

1886
01:57:04,545 --> 01:57:07,792
TALIESIN: Have you met us? We're all a bit weird,
and you don't ask a ton of questions.

1887
01:57:07,792 --> 01:57:12,486
MARISHA: Yeah, but there's a difference between
"quirky" weird and "Oh, I think this person's life

1888
01:57:12,486 --> 01:57:14,501
"force is being siphoned away from them" weird.

1889
01:57:14,501 --> 01:57:18,543
TALIESIN: There is. It's the difference between
being in a carnival and not being in a carnival.

1890
01:57:18,543 --> 01:57:20,718
MARISHA: Then why were you with the carnival?

1891
01:57:20,718 --> 01:57:22,206
TALIESIN: Because I'm weird!

1892
01:57:22,206 --> 01:57:23,808
MARISHA: (groaning)

1893
01:57:23,808 --> 01:57:27,598
SAM: That tracks. That fully tracks.

1894
01:57:27,598 --> 01:57:37,494
TALIESIN: I mean, it's putting together. He was
never that talkative. I don't know. I don't like it.

1895
01:57:37,494 --> 01:57:40,066
LIAM: Well, what are we doing?

1896
01:57:40,066 --> 01:57:41,861
MARISHA: Let's go find the damn toad!

1897
01:57:41,861 --> 01:57:45,162
TRAVIS: Can I use Mask of Many Faces to change
into that older gray-haired farmer?

1898
01:57:45,162 --> 01:57:50,090
MATT: Sure. Easy enough. The sun is close to
setting. you've got about another 30 minutes

1899
01:57:50,090 --> 01:57:51,487
or so before it sets.

1900
01:57:51,487 --> 01:57:52,437
SAM: Let's go.

1901
01:57:52,437 --> 01:57:53,872
LAURA: I bless you.

1902
01:57:53,872 --> 01:58:01,841
SAM: Gesundheit. On the way out, can I grab some
booze from the bar to fill up my platinum flask?

1903
01:58:01,841 --> 01:58:04,053
Or to fill it up a little?

1904
01:58:04,053 --> 01:58:13,650
MATT: Okay, we'll say for that, that'll run you
about-- Fine liquor? About two silver pieces.

1905
01:58:13,650 --> 01:58:15,777
SAM: Great. I'll mark it down.

1906
01:58:15,777 --> 01:58:17,550
MATT: It's a hefty flask, too.

1907
01:58:17,550 --> 01:58:19,624
TRAVIS: Using D&D Beyond.

1908
01:58:19,624 --> 01:58:23,429
(laughter)

1909
01:58:23,429 --> 01:58:30,471
MATT: Mark that bar tally. All right. Liquor
refilled, you go towards the window, you all

1910
01:58:30,471 --> 01:58:36,854
gather and glance out, and in the alley below the
inn is a stationed crownsguard that wasn't there

1911
01:58:36,854 --> 01:58:41,982
before. You immediately get the sense that with
the sudden murder of two crownsguard being

1912
01:58:41,982 --> 01:58:44,640
discovered in the vicinity, they may have beefed
up security a little bit.

1913
01:58:44,640 --> 01:58:46,098
MARISHA: Ah shit.

1914
01:58:46,098 --> 01:58:50,778
MATT: Only one of them is guarding the alley's
exit onto the main street, and they're looking

1915
01:58:50,778 --> 01:58:55,716
away at the moment out into the road, but occasionally
glance over their shoulder into the alley. But

1916
01:58:55,716 --> 01:58:59,510
there appears to be a little more of a security
set-up.

1917
01:58:59,510 --> 01:59:04,472
LAURA: Maybe you should go out the front and talk
to him and distract him so we can sneak out the window.

1918
01:59:04,472 --> 01:59:13,585
TRAVIS: I can do that. Do you want to come along
on this little escapade?

1919
01:59:13,585 --> 01:59:17,136
LIAM: Yes, I'm a good talker when I have to be.

1920
01:59:17,136 --> 01:59:19,273
SAM: As am I.

1921
01:59:19,273 --> 01:59:20,790
TALIESIN: Well!

1922
01:59:20,790 --> 01:59:22,685
LIAM: Not for this.

1923
01:59:22,685 --> 01:59:24,284
SAM: I'll keep lookout.

1924
01:59:24,284 --> 01:59:27,311
TALIESIN: I am not the right kind of talker for
this.

1925
01:59:27,311 --> 01:59:30,511
TRAVIS: Fair enough. So I'll head out the front.

1926
01:59:30,511 --> 01:59:32,812
MATT: Okay, you exit without issue.

1927
01:59:32,812 --> 01:59:35,251
TRAVIS: Can I locate the crownsguard?

1928
01:59:35,251 --> 01:59:38,404
MATT: Easy enough, and as you exit the tavern, you
can see where once there were two guards sitting

1929
01:59:38,404 --> 01:59:44,082
at the front, there's now three, and there are two
guards stationed across the street that are

1930
01:59:44,082 --> 01:59:47,225
keeping a watch. It looks like everyone's on high
alert since they've had some of their own

1931
01:59:47,225 --> 01:59:54,260
crownsguard killed. You make your way around the
corner, through the T-intersection to the other

1932
01:59:54,260 --> 02:00:00,039
road that meets with the main street that crosses
in front of the Nestled Nook, and you see the

1933
02:00:00,039 --> 02:00:04,581
guard stationed outside who's currently leaning up
against the wall, arms crossed, looking back and forth.

1934
02:00:04,581 --> 02:00:09,830
TRAVIS: Can I run up to him and say: (old raspy
voice) You, please, over here! I've seen one of

1935
02:00:09,830 --> 02:00:15,053
those creatures! It's tearing into him and it's
horrible. Please, come quickly!

1936
02:00:15,053 --> 02:00:17,453
MATT: Make a deception check.

1937
02:00:17,453 --> 02:00:23,226
SAM: Oh yes, here it is. Come on, charis.

1938
02:00:23,226 --> 02:00:24,623
TRAVIS: 15.

1939
02:00:24,623 --> 02:00:28,736
MATT: 15? He goes, "Which way? Please, point and
show me."

1940
02:00:28,736 --> 02:00:30,400
TRAVIS: This way, quickly, please!

1941
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:35,996
MATT: He grabs his blade and draws it out, and
gives a jog after you. The rest of you guys make

1942
02:00:36,098 --> 02:00:40,742
your way down quickly outside into the alleyway.
Make a stealth check.

1943
02:00:40,742 --> 02:00:44,708
LAURA: I'm so scared of rolling right now.

1944
02:00:44,708 --> 02:00:47,336
TALIESIN: Why does every roll have to be-- Oh
thank god.

1945
02:00:47,336 --> 02:00:48,896
MARISHA: Oh my god, why.

1946
02:00:48,896 --> 02:00:50,336
LAURA: Oh, no.

1947
02:00:50,336 --> 02:00:52,782
SAM: We're fine, we went out the front door.

1948
02:00:52,782 --> 02:00:54,202
MARISHA: Nope, it's a one.

1949
02:00:54,202 --> 02:00:55,832
TRAVIS: It's a nordic "7."

1950
02:00:55,832 --> 02:00:56,882
LAURA: No!

1951
02:00:56,882 --> 02:00:58,302
TALIESIN: 18.

1952
02:00:58,302 --> 02:00:59,816
LAURA: 21.

1953
02:00:59,816 --> 02:01:01,293
SAM: We're going out the front door.

1954
02:01:01,293 --> 02:01:02,744
MATT: All right.

1955
02:01:02,744 --> 02:01:06,441
MARISHA: I don't know! You know, if it's binary,
one means--

1956
02:01:10,299 --> 02:01:18,994
MATT: All right. Between the three of you making
the check that's still a majority success. But you

1957
02:01:18,994 --> 02:01:21,316
do pop your ankle when you land.

1958
02:01:21,316 --> 02:01:22,850
MARISHA: Did you see the stink-eye he gave me?

1959
02:01:22,850 --> 02:01:26,326
LAURA: Don't make comments after 
he just was kind to us.

1960
02:01:26,326 --> 02:01:32,807
MATT: I was being kind! You sprained your ankle a
little bit as you land and you kind of hop behind

1961
02:01:32,861 --> 02:01:33,946
but the three of you make your way past the alley
without issue.

1962
02:01:35,586 --> 02:01:38,442
SAM: Does she have disadvantage on all checks 
for the next two days?

1963
02:01:38,442 --> 02:01:39,272
MATT: No.

1964
02:01:39,272 --> 02:01:40,272
(laughter)

1965
02:01:40,272 --> 02:01:42,349
SAM: That's how I would rule it.

1966
02:01:42,349 --> 02:01:44,894
TALIESIN: This is why we don't have you as DM.

1967
02:01:44,911 --> 02:01:51,385
MARISHA: This ankle is affecting my wisdom! It's
reaching into my family's history!

1968
02:01:51,385 --> 02:01:54,263
LIAM: Dungeons & Dragons is about punishment.

1969
02:01:54,263 --> 02:01:59,781
MATT: The three of you dart on the outside and
make your way down the alley behind what looks to

1970
02:01:59,781 --> 02:02:06,221
be a cluster of empty rain barrels that are set up
to catch during storms, and you appear to have

1971
02:02:06,221 --> 02:02:10,653
managed to just avoid the sight of the guarding
crownsguard on the outside of the inn. Caleb and

1972
02:02:10,653 --> 02:02:12,821
Nott, what are you guys doing?

1973
02:02:12,821 --> 02:02:16,622
LIAM: We're scouting the way nonchalantly, I would
imagine.

1974
02:02:20,282 --> 02:02:22,613
SAM: I'm real! I'm with you!

1975
02:02:22,641 --> 02:02:27,426
MATT: So they darted off into the alley, what are
you guys doing?

1976
02:02:27,727 --> 02:02:29,634
LIAM: We could make our way to the outskirts of
town.

1977
02:02:29,634 --> 02:02:33,781
SAM: I said that I would be on lookout duty, so
I'm just peering-- Wait they went to the alley to

1978
02:02:33,781 --> 02:02:34,547
go?

1979
02:02:34,547 --> 02:02:41,598
MATT: While he was distracting them, you saw the
guard leave with Fjord.

1980
02:02:41,598 --> 02:02:43,713
SAM: We'll go with, right?

1981
02:02:43,713 --> 02:02:50,208
LIAM: No, we can stay in the open. I send Frumpkin
up into the air over the party, 100 feet in the air.

1982
02:02:50,234 --> 02:02:53,189
SAM: We're just going out in the open to the
water.

1983
02:02:53,189 --> 02:02:55,312
TALIESIN: We can also follow the bird.

1984
02:02:55,312 --> 02:02:59,446
MARISHA: Yeah, I was going to say, why don't you
guys lead the way, and you guys give us a signal

1985
02:02:59,446 --> 02:03:01,704
if you guys see a guard.

1986
02:03:01,704 --> 02:03:05,106
MATT: You aren't there. You haven't caught up with
them yet, they're still out in the open.

1987
02:03:05,106 --> 02:03:07,087
TALIESIN: I miss the earrings.

1988
02:03:07,087 --> 02:03:13,455
LIAM: So I take your hand, and I'm watching them
from above.

1989
02:03:13,455 --> 02:03:16,875
SAM: I'm guiding him along.

1990
02:03:16,875 --> 02:03:19,334
MATT: So the two of you make your way towards the
docks slowly.

1991
02:03:19,334 --> 02:03:21,568
LIAM: I'm totally acting like I see everything.

1992
02:03:21,568 --> 02:03:23,367
MATT: Right. I see everything.

1993
02:03:23,367 --> 02:03:25,421
LAURA: I have my hood up.

1994
02:03:25,421 --> 02:03:27,605
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I'm over cloak.

1995
02:03:27,605 --> 02:03:30,978
TRAVIS: Weekend at Bernie's walking. Looking
around at nothing.

1996
02:03:30,978 --> 02:03:34,555
MATT: You guide for two and a half blocks and the
guard's still like, "Where is it?"

1997
02:03:34,555 --> 02:03:42,793
TRAVIS: I look over my shoulder and keep running,
and then go: Oh, what do you want? Who are you?

1998
02:03:42,793 --> 02:03:46,791
Why are you following me?

1999
02:03:46,791 --> 02:03:49,212
MATT: "You called me-- You said there was one of
them--"

2000
02:03:49,212 --> 02:03:58,138
TRAVIS: Have I done something again? Have you seen
my son? What's your name? You're a strong looking--

2001
02:03:58,323 --> 02:04:00,555
MATT: He sheathes the blade.

2002
02:04:00,555 --> 02:04:04,749
TRAVIS: Oh dear. Do you have any coin?

2003
02:04:06,475 --> 02:04:09,704
LIAM: It's badass.

2004
02:04:09,704 --> 02:04:16,017
MATT: He walks up and slaps you across the top of
the head, and just goes, "Don't go wasting our time."

2005
02:04:16,199 --> 02:04:24,255
TRAVIS: I'm sorry. No respect for the elderly,
apparently. I walk away.

2006
02:04:24,255 --> 02:04:27,919
MATT: He spits on the ground towards you and turns
around and heads back to his post.

2007
02:04:27,919 --> 02:04:33,803
TRAVIS: (grunting) I make my way towards the
docks.

2008
02:04:33,803 --> 02:04:38,569
MATT: You all manage to slowly make your way to
the outskirts of the Ustaloch, down to where the

2009
02:04:38,569 --> 02:04:45,023
majority of the docks are set up on the lake
itself. Since the lights have gone out, most of

2010
02:04:45,023 --> 02:04:50,312
the boats have now come back in, and they are
bringing in their hauls out, and have small nets

2011
02:04:50,312 --> 02:04:54,057
and baskets filled with fish they've caught while
they're out there, small crustaceans, most of them

2012
02:04:54,057 --> 02:04:58,923
are in the process of just offloading and locking
up and tying their boats. What are you guys doing?

2013
02:04:59,109 --> 02:05:05,589
LIAM: I think perhaps the best thing to do is to
rent a boat, not steal a boat.

2014
02:05:05,589 --> 02:05:07,950
LAURA: You should talk to people.

2015
02:05:07,950 --> 02:05:11,905
TRAVIS: I think we may be able to avoid any kind
of trading of currency.

2016
02:05:11,905 --> 02:05:13,915
LIAM: What's your idea?

2017
02:05:13,915 --> 02:05:18,035
TRAVIS: Let me see if I can find a boat that would
accommodate all of us and see if we can find some

2018
02:05:18,035 --> 02:05:19,906
amicable people.

2019
02:05:19,906 --> 02:05:21,088
LIAM: All right.

2020
02:05:21,088 --> 02:05:27,688
TRAVIS: As a sailor, apparently I'm able to
acquire free passage on ships.

2021
02:05:27,688 --> 02:05:30,169
MATT: You are, actually.

2022
02:05:30,209 --> 02:05:37,098
TRAVIS: I have to talk the talk and
maybe trade something, but--

2023
02:05:37,098 --> 02:05:40,530
MATT: One of the larger fishing
vessels that can carry a group of your size, as

2024
02:05:40,530 --> 02:05:44,763
well as a couple of others, has already been
pulled in and most everyone has been loaded off.

2025
02:05:44,763 --> 02:05:50,424
You can see there's one gentleman in his
mid-forties, a little bit of a five o'clock shadow

2026
02:05:50,424 --> 02:05:57,892
on his chin, a small scar across the bottom of it.
He has a heavy knitted cap that's folded back onto

2027
02:05:57,892 --> 02:06:04,297
the top of his shoulders and a long coat, and as
he's standing there, he looks over at you and

2028
02:06:04,297 --> 02:06:08,502
watches you approach, taking the rope and tying it
around the edge.

2029
02:06:08,502 --> 02:06:15,745
TRAVIS: Hello there. I was hoping that perhaps I
could trouble you. We're trying to make our way

2030
02:06:15,745 --> 02:06:23,039
out into the lake, some of my companions and I,
for a small day trip. We've never quite been out

2031
02:06:23,039 --> 02:06:28,409
on the lake, not this one. Is there a chance we
could trade some work on your day's journey for

2032
02:06:28,409 --> 02:06:31,715
some travel?

2033
02:06:31,715 --> 02:06:39,402
MATT: "If you're looking for someone to take you
around the lake, I could do that for a bit of coin, sure."

2034
02:06:39,556 --> 02:06:45,397
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, we're a bit light on coin. Is
there perhaps anything we could help you with

2035
02:06:45,397 --> 02:06:47,955
around here in trade?

2036
02:06:47,955 --> 02:06:52,618
MATT: He glances at your hands as you're talking,
"You look like a hard-worker."

2037
02:06:52,618 --> 02:06:54,378
TRAVIS: Indeed. Many years of my life.

2038
02:06:54,542 --> 02:06:56,435
MATT: "Where are you from?"

2039
02:06:56,435 --> 02:06:58,504
TRAVIS: Port Damali.

2040
02:06:58,504 --> 02:07:05,005
MATT: "I see you've been a shiphand before. I can
see the cracks in the fingers."

2041
02:07:05,005 --> 02:07:08,165
TRAVIS: They never go away.

2042
02:07:08,165 --> 02:07:13,202
MATT: He looks at his own hand. "So you're just
looking for a joyride?"

2043
02:07:13,202 --> 02:07:21,734
TRAVIS: Yes, it would help me look a bit more
impressive in the eyes of my younger comrades.

2044
02:07:21,734 --> 02:07:30,651
MATT: "I'll tell you what. I'll take you around.
You get a bottle to take more out there, we'll

2045
02:07:30,651 --> 02:07:31,802
call it even."

2046
02:07:31,802 --> 02:07:33,048
TRAVIS: Much obliged.

2047
02:07:33,048 --> 02:07:37,314
MATT: "All right." He goes and starts getting the
boat ready to go back out on the lake.

2048
02:07:37,314 --> 02:07:40,540
TRAVIS: I go back. It fucking worked.

2049
02:07:40,540 --> 02:07:42,767
LAURA: That was pretty cool, Gramps.

2050
02:07:42,767 --> 02:07:48,059
TRAVIS: Thanks. We should go.

2051
02:07:48,059 --> 02:07:54,283
MATT: He's getting ready. The trade was to bring a
bottle.

2052
02:07:54,283 --> 02:08:00,490
TRAVIS: A bottle! Right. You don't happen to carry
any fine firewhiskey on you, do you?

2053
02:08:00,490 --> 02:08:02,587
SAM: Nope.

2054
02:08:02,587 --> 02:08:09,582
TRAVIS: If I gave you some money, could you go
pick us up a nice bottle of some stuff?

2055
02:08:09,582 --> 02:08:10,771
SAM: Yes.

2056
02:08:10,771 --> 02:08:13,071
TRAVIS: I don't trust you. If I gave you some
money, could you--?

2057
02:08:13,071 --> 02:08:15,779
LAURA: Yes, you can definitely trust me.

2058
02:08:15,779 --> 02:08:19,592
TRAVIS: I don't trust you either. Beau, I'm going
to give you three gold.

2059
02:08:19,592 --> 02:08:22,593
MARISHA: That's too much, but do I get to keep the
change?

2060
02:08:22,593 --> 02:08:23,922
TRAVIS: No.

2061
02:08:23,922 --> 02:08:29,851
MARISHA: Damn it. I'll be right back. I go get two
bottles.

2062
02:08:29,994 --> 02:08:40,207
MATT: A bottle of fine wine runs you about ten
gold pieces. A bottle of basic wine, about a gold.

2063
02:08:40,207 --> 02:08:44,102
This is some Two-Buck Chuck style of wine.

2064
02:08:44,102 --> 02:08:46,317
TRAVIS: You can't come back with ten gold wine if
I said I was broke.

2065
02:08:46,317 --> 02:08:47,759
MARISHA: Exactly.

2066
02:08:47,759 --> 02:08:50,223
TALIESIN: Two-Gold Bold.

2067
02:08:52,493 --> 02:08:57,454
MATT: You spend the gold and you get a bottle of
cheap wine, make your way back to the boat--

2068
02:08:57,491 --> 02:09:00,686
LAURA: Can I pull Fjord aside while she's off
doing that?

2069
02:09:00,686 --> 02:09:01,826
MATT: Yeah.

2070
02:09:01,826 --> 02:09:09,041
LAURA: Fjord, that voice you're doing. It almost
sounded like you actually did in Port Damali.

2071
02:09:09,041 --> 02:09:11,320
TRAVIS: Right, yeah.

2072
02:09:11,320 --> 02:09:16,005
LAURA: I mean, I like that voice. I like this
voice too, though.

2073
02:09:16,005 --> 02:09:20,407
TRAVIS: Oh, well I'm glad. I'm partial to it
myself.

2074
02:09:20,407 --> 02:09:24,263
LAURA: I like it. You can keep doing it.

2075
02:09:24,951 --> 02:09:32,753
MATT: As you return with the bottle, you all get
onto the boat. The older gentleman, as you all get

2076
02:09:32,753 --> 02:09:44,923
on, introduces himself: "I'm Noah, this is my
vessel. I'll take you where you need to go. Now,

2077
02:09:44,923 --> 02:09:51,312
if I can ask where you're headed. Want to do a
pass on the lake and back, or..."

2078
02:09:51,312 --> 02:09:54,012
SAM: Caleb, where are we headed?

2079
02:09:54,012 --> 02:09:58,280
LAURA: Wait, are you still in bird mode?

2080
02:09:58,280 --> 02:10:04,178
LIAM: No. That ended. We hear that there's
beautiful islands out in the middle of the

2081
02:10:04,178 --> 02:10:05,863
Ustaloch.

2082
02:10:05,863 --> 02:10:11,709
MATT: As he pulls the rest of the rope in as you
guys are on board, he stops. "Beautiful?"

2083
02:10:11,709 --> 02:10:18,574
TRAVIS: They haven't been on the water much. An
island to the eyes of someone like him would appear--

2084
02:10:18,598 --> 02:10:23,839
LIAM: I've never seen a lake before this one so,
first island. It's a very big moment for me.

2085
02:10:23,839 --> 02:10:27,987
MATT: He goes and gets his paddle out and begins
making his way-- "Well there's only two islands

2086
02:10:27,987 --> 02:10:33,105
out there. One's a piece of shite and the other's
Crookedstone."

2087
02:10:33,105 --> 02:10:35,337
LAURA: What's Crookedstone?

2088
02:10:35,337 --> 02:10:38,651
MATT: "Crookedstone used to be where and old witch
lived about a hundred years ago."

2089
02:10:38,651 --> 02:10:40,263
(gasps)

2090
02:10:40,263 --> 02:10:42,643
MATT: "No one goes over to Crookedstone."

2091
02:10:42,643 --> 02:10:43,809
TALIESIN: Well!

2092
02:10:43,809 --> 02:10:45,124
(laughter)

2093
02:10:45,124 --> 02:10:46,512
MARISHA: No one goes to Crookedstone.

2094
02:10:46,512 --> 02:10:48,190
TALIESIN: That is our siren's call.

2095
02:10:48,190 --> 02:10:50,895
LIAM: Did you say piece of shite? What's the name
of the other one?

2096
02:10:50,895 --> 02:10:53,190
MATT: "Well, it doesn't really have a name. It's
too small."

2097
02:10:53,190 --> 02:10:54,770
LAURA: Oh, so the big one is Crookedstone?

2098
02:10:54,770 --> 02:10:56,648
LIAM: Crookedstone, yeah.

2099
02:10:56,648 --> 02:10:59,034
MATT: "Can I ask you where you're going?"

2100
02:10:59,034 --> 02:11:01,698
LAURA: I mean, that sounds like fun, right?

2101
02:11:01,698 --> 02:11:03,484
MARISHA: Yeah, you guys aren't actually afraid of
some--

2102
02:11:03,484 --> 02:11:05,340
MATT: He puts the oar down--

2103
02:11:08,450 --> 02:11:09,428
SAM: Boink.

2104
02:11:09,617 --> 02:11:13,381
MATT: (cork removal noise) (gulps) (sighs)

2105
02:11:13,381 --> 02:11:14,725
TALIESIN: No aerator?

2106
02:11:14,725 --> 02:11:16,355
(laughter)

2107
02:11:16,355 --> 02:11:17,813
SAM: You monster!

2108
02:11:17,813 --> 02:11:19,833
(laughter)

2109
02:11:19,833 --> 02:11:22,274
TALIESIN: You've ruined it.

2110
02:11:22,274 --> 02:11:26,978
MATT: "Fair be it to me to judge. To Crookedstone,
then." He picks up his oar and begins paddling.

2111
02:11:26,978 --> 02:11:29,560
LAURA: Tell me more about this witch!

2112
02:11:29,560 --> 02:11:34,339
MATT: "I don't know. Probably died many years ago
and no one goes around, seeing as it's cursed

2113
02:11:34,339 --> 02:11:37,681
land. You'll see for yourself soon enough."

2114
02:11:37,681 --> 02:11:40,303
LAURA: Did she have a wart on her nose?

2115
02:11:40,303 --> 02:11:41,145
MATT: "Probably."

2116
02:11:41,145 --> 02:11:42,218
LAURA: Yeah.

2117
02:11:42,218 --> 02:11:44,094
MATT: "We don't really deal with witch folk."

2118
02:11:44,094 --> 02:11:46,110
LAURA: Did she wear a hat? Like a pointy one?

2119
02:11:46,135 --> 02:11:48,127
MATT: "I'd only expect as such."

2120
02:11:48,127 --> 02:11:49,402
LAURA: Right?

2121
02:11:49,402 --> 02:11:53,187
MATT: (chuckles) Takes another swig as you guys
begin to make your way towards the center of the

2122
02:11:53,187 --> 02:11:54,198
Ustaloch--

2123
02:11:54,198 --> 02:11:58,461
TRAVIS: Can I put an arm around Beau and have her
come to the front of the boat so we can check out

2124
02:11:58,461 --> 02:12:00,831
the waters as we're going, just for anything that
might be--

2125
02:12:00,831 --> 02:12:02,562
MATT: Sure. Both of you make a perception check,
please.

2126
02:12:02,562 --> 02:12:04,023
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep my eyes peeled as
well.

2127
02:12:04,023 --> 02:12:05,375
MATT: Sure.

2128
02:12:05,375 --> 02:12:07,390
LAURA: I'm going to draw witches in my
sketchbook.

2129
02:12:07,390 --> 02:12:09,994
MARISHA: (yelling) God fucking shitballs cock!

2130
02:12:09,994 --> 02:12:11,661
LIAM: I actually tagged along with them.

2131
02:12:11,661 --> 02:12:13,516
MATT: Okay.

2132
02:12:13,516 --> 02:12:15,809
TALIESIN: (growls and sighs)

2133
02:12:15,809 --> 02:12:17,150
LAURA: So it went well?

2134
02:12:17,150 --> 02:12:18,740
MARISHA: (high-pitched) It's great. It's a good
roll.

2135
02:12:18,740 --> 02:12:21,444
SAM: I'm drinking tons of whiskey because I'm
super scared to be on the water.

2136
02:12:21,444 --> 02:12:23,429
TALIESIN: Eight.

2137
02:12:23,429 --> 02:12:25,320
TRAVIS: 13.

2138
02:12:25,320 --> 02:12:27,074
LIAM: 20.

2139
02:12:27,074 --> 02:12:30,062
MATT: Okay. For future note, if everyone's going
to make a perception check I may have a few folks,

2140
02:12:30,062 --> 02:12:34,565
you know, to helm it, and other people aiding
their roll with advantage. Just so we don't end up

2141
02:12:34,565 --> 02:12:39,624
having a barrage of perception like, "They failed?
<i>I</i> do it. They failed? <i>I</i> do it." Because that

2142
02:12:39,624 --> 02:12:45,962
gets a little lame. All right, as you guys keep
watch over the edge of the water, heading in as

2143
02:12:45,962 --> 02:12:51,158
the sky darkens, heading towards Crookedstone, the
island in the center of the Ustaloch. Prepare

2144
02:12:51,158 --> 02:12:54,728
yourselves for whatever you'll find there and
we're going to go to break!

2145
02:12:54,728 --> 02:12:57,535
TRAVIS: Crookedstone, here we come!

2146
02:12:57,535 --> 02:13:02,293
MATT: It's time. We're going to go ahead and take
a quick ten minute break, roughly. We have ten

2147
02:13:02,293 --> 02:13:06,439
minutes so we get a little bathroom break. We'll
be back here shortly. Make sure to stick around

2148
02:13:06,439 --> 02:13:11,563
for a video at the break in which we have our
Wyrmwood contest to win some awesome Wyrmwood

2149
02:13:11,563 --> 02:13:17,104
stuff, so keep an eye. We'll be back here in a
little bit. See you soon.

2150
02:13:17,104 --> 02:27:46,554
[break]

2151
02:27:46,627 --> 02:27:50,423
MATT: Welcome back! Sam!

2152
02:27:50,423 --> 02:27:52,782
TRAVIS: Wow. There's Hail Marys and then there's
that.

2153
02:27:52,782 --> 02:27:55,679
LIAM: (laughing)

2154
02:27:55,679 --> 02:28:00,423
MATT: Oh, I'm going to get you guys back one of
these days real hard.

2155
02:28:00,423 --> 02:28:02,312
MARISHA: You already do.

2156
02:28:02,312 --> 02:28:04,060
TRAVIS: Don't poke the DM.

2157
02:28:04,060 --> 02:28:06,514
LIAM: Did that make it in? That was a nuke!

2158
02:28:06,514 --> 02:28:08,464
MATT: Welcome back.

2159
02:28:08,464 --> 02:28:10,433
TALIESIN: I was weirdly expecting more.

2160
02:28:10,433 --> 02:28:12,170
LIAM: Are you kidding?

2161
02:28:12,170 --> 02:28:22,686
MATT: Our winner of the grandiose collection of
Wyrmwood elements is koehlerart. Congratulations,

2162
02:28:22,686 --> 02:28:28,376
you're the winner. Danoba will contact you and get
your information. Pretty nice win on your part.

2163
02:28:28,376 --> 02:28:32,216
We'll have next week another giveaway to look
forward to that.

2164
02:28:32,216 --> 02:28:34,401
LAURA: I choked on my spit as I wooed.

2165
02:28:34,401 --> 02:28:36,775
MATT: You swooed? Don't do that.

2166
02:28:36,775 --> 02:28:39,338
TALIESIN: I don't even know how you did that!

2167
02:28:39,338 --> 02:28:52,302
MATT: The sun has set as you guys approach the
outer banks of the Crookedstone Island in the

2168
02:28:52,302 --> 02:29:00,294
center of the Ustaloch. You can see the grove, a
clustered central conglomerate of trees that all

2169
02:29:00,294 --> 02:29:08,171
create this mound of brush. Now that you're up
close against it, you can see the bit of moonlight

2170
02:29:08,171 --> 02:29:14,093
that's starting to come over the horizon dancing
across the upper part of the canopy. The trees, at

2171
02:29:14,093 --> 02:29:22,684
most, are about 15 to ten feet tall. They're not
incredibly huge, some even hovering around the

2172
02:29:22,684 --> 02:29:24,797
five to ten foot range on the outskirts.

2173
02:29:24,797 --> 02:29:28,085
LAURA: How tall was the lizard man? Devil toad?

2174
02:29:28,085 --> 02:29:32,511
MATT: He was about eight feet tall, hunched
forward.

2175
02:29:32,511 --> 02:29:33,712
LAURA: Okay.

2176
02:29:33,712 --> 02:29:35,494
LIAM: That's big.

2177
02:29:35,494 --> 02:29:42,175
MATT: As you approach the bank, you can see
already there's a lot of heavy rocks. This is not

2178
02:29:42,175 --> 02:29:48,648
a soft, muddy embankment like the outskirts of the
lake. This has a lot of jagged rock, and your

2179
02:29:48,648 --> 02:29:55,755
ship-finding friend is carefully making his way
through as close as he can before he comes to a

2180
02:29:55,755 --> 02:30:02,168
stop, pushes off with an oar, and says, "All
right, I think this is as close as I can get. What

2181
02:30:02,168 --> 02:30:07,582
"are you doing here, if I might ask?"

2182
02:30:07,582 --> 02:30:09,833
LAURA: We are going to have a picnic on the
island.

2183
02:30:09,833 --> 02:30:10,991
MARISHA: Beach party.

2184
02:30:10,991 --> 02:30:12,836
LAURA: Nighttime beach party!

2185
02:30:12,836 --> 02:30:14,446
MATT: Make a deception check.

2186
02:30:14,446 --> 02:30:16,744
SAM: Nighttime beach party.

2187
02:30:16,744 --> 02:30:19,231
TRAVIS: We're carrying nothing.

2188
02:30:19,231 --> 02:30:24,697
LAURA: Wait, what is it, a deception? 14.

2189
02:30:24,697 --> 02:30:28,004
MATT: "Sorry I asked."

2190
02:30:28,004 --> 02:30:32,686
MARISHA: The nighttime is the best time to go
frog-digging.

2191
02:30:32,686 --> 02:30:34,443
MATT: "I'll tell you what."

2192
02:30:34,443 --> 02:30:36,274
SAM: That is true.

2193
02:30:36,274 --> 02:30:37,456
TRAVIS: Kentucky.

2194
02:30:37,456 --> 02:30:39,314
MARISHA: Yeah!

2195
02:30:39,314 --> 02:30:46,396
MATT: "I get the sense the less I know, the better
off I am. Go about your business, I'll be waiting

2196
02:30:46,396 --> 02:30:56,210
"here. Don't do anything stupid. I'm not getting
involved with anything. If there's some illegal

2197
02:30:56,210 --> 02:30:59,622
"business here and I see something shifty, I'm back
on the shore and you have to swim your way home."

2198
02:30:59,622 --> 02:31:01,943
TRAVIS: Of course. Would someone help me down?

2199
02:31:01,943 --> 02:31:06,522
LAURA: Here, I'll help you, Gramps. On either
side.

2200
02:31:06,522 --> 02:31:11,708
SAM: All you need to know is, there's three dudes
and three ladies. You do the math.

2201
02:31:11,708 --> 02:31:14,242
TALIESIN: Don't do the math.

2202
02:31:14,242 --> 02:31:18,104
MATT: He takes the bottle and takes a big, heavy
swig, and sits down in the boat.

2203
02:31:18,104 --> 02:31:20,613
TRAVIS: We'll return.

2204
02:31:20,613 --> 02:31:28,906
MATT: All right. As you guys step off the boat
into about ankle-deep water, traversing the broken

2205
02:31:28,906 --> 02:31:36,275
bits of sharpened stone, making your way to the
actual island of Crookedstone, you begin to slowly

2206
02:31:36,275 --> 02:31:39,408
approach the outside of the treeline. What do you
guys want to do?

2207
02:31:39,408 --> 02:31:44,047
LAURA: Should I cast Good and Evil Detection
again?

2208
02:31:44,047 --> 02:31:45,585
SAM: That seemed to work.

2209
02:31:45,585 --> 02:31:47,159
LAURA: I can do it.

2210
02:31:47,159 --> 02:31:51,842
TALIESIN: Before you do, let's take a look around.
I'm going to take a look around to see if I can

2211
02:31:51,842 --> 02:31:54,769
find any footprints.

2212
02:31:54,769 --> 02:31:58,299
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2213
02:31:58,299 --> 02:32:00,796
TALIESIN: Can I use my (mumbles) again, or no?

2214
02:32:00,796 --> 02:32:03,378
MATT: What are you doing? Are you looking around
for details?

2215
02:32:03,378 --> 02:32:08,586
TALIESIN: I'm specifically looking for signs of
Kylre.

2216
02:32:08,586 --> 02:32:11,650
MATT: Make a survival check, with advantage.

2217
02:32:11,650 --> 02:32:13,488
LAURA: What was the name of the creature again?

2218
02:32:13,488 --> 02:32:15,104
MARISHA: A nergaliid.

2219
02:32:15,104 --> 02:32:16,884
SAM: Heavens to Murgatroyd.

2220
02:32:16,884 --> 02:32:20,468
TALIESIN: Wow, that's awful. Wait, that's cocked.

2221
02:32:20,468 --> 02:32:23,087
LIAM: We're under the light of the moons,
correct?

2222
02:32:23,087 --> 02:32:27,334
TALIESIN: That's awful. I can't even-- that's
eight.

2223
02:32:27,334 --> 02:32:33,565
MATT: It's hard to tell. Because it's such a rocky
shore, there aren't a lot of signs of landfall.

2224
02:32:33,565 --> 02:32:36,071
LIAM: Moonlight, at this point?

2225
02:32:36,071 --> 02:32:43,384
MATT: Moonlight, and a little bit of a dissipating
orange-purple glow in the sky.

2226
02:32:43,384 --> 02:32:45,784
TALIESIN: That's right, we've got some humans.

2227
02:32:45,784 --> 02:32:47,513
SAM: I did a Travis burp.

2228
02:32:47,513 --> 02:32:48,737
MATT: Oh no.

2229
02:32:48,737 --> 02:32:50,128
LAURA: He blew it out.

2230
02:32:50,128 --> 02:32:51,664
SAM: I blew it that way!

2231
02:32:51,664 --> 02:32:53,110
MARISHA: Thanks?

2232
02:32:53,110 --> 02:32:55,298
TALIESIN: Oh wow.

2233
02:32:55,298 --> 02:32:57,515
TRAVIS: You can taste it, can't you?

2234
02:32:57,515 --> 02:32:59,611
MATT: What's the plan, guys?

2235
02:32:59,611 --> 02:33:02,348
MARISHA: You didn't find anything?

2236
02:33:02,348 --> 02:33:04,544
TALIESIN: We can start heading in.

2237
02:33:04,544 --> 02:33:07,514
LAURA: I can cast it, I just will lose a spell
slot.

2238
02:33:07,514 --> 02:33:15,942
LIAM: Hold on. I send Frumpkin into the sky. Look
down, and see if now that I have him flying

2239
02:33:15,942 --> 02:33:20,654
closer, maybe I can see better, or see something
moving in this dim light, before it goes?

2240
02:33:20,654 --> 02:33:22,539
MATT: Perception check on Frumpkin, please.

2241
02:33:22,539 --> 02:33:24,648
LAURA: Roll really good.

2242
02:33:24,648 --> 02:33:26,963
MATT: With disadvantage because of the lack of
light.

2243
02:33:26,963 --> 02:33:29,328
LIAM: Balls. That's a big seven.

2244
02:33:29,328 --> 02:33:34,390
MARISHA: We're lowly humans. How did you deal with
this?

2245
02:33:34,390 --> 02:33:40,277
TALIESIN: It was awful. I let all of you go first
everywhere.

2246
02:33:40,277 --> 02:33:46,148
MATT: Yeah, the lack of detail, nothing really
catches Frumpkin's eye from above.

2247
02:33:46,148 --> 02:33:49,236
LIAM: It's too dark. (flutters)

2248
02:33:49,236 --> 02:33:57,432
MARISHA: Can I look and see if I see any big
broken branches, or sign of something big moving

2249
02:33:57,432 --> 02:33:58,989
through the forest?

2250
02:33:58,989 --> 02:34:00,415
MATT: Make a perception check.

2251
02:34:00,415 --> 02:34:02,165
MARISHA: Perception? Not investigation?

2252
02:34:02,165 --> 02:34:05,251
MATT: Are you glancing about, or are you going to
wade through the forest to look for things?

2253
02:34:05,251 --> 02:34:07,902
LIAM: No ranger.

2254
02:34:07,902 --> 02:34:15,129
MARISHA: I'd like to move up to the treeline and
see where the mud is, and see if I can see any

2255
02:34:15,129 --> 02:34:17,216
sign of something big moving through the forest.

2256
02:34:17,216 --> 02:34:18,602
TALIESIN: Or for a witch's hut.

2257
02:34:18,602 --> 02:34:20,537
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2258
02:34:20,537 --> 02:34:22,298
LAURA: It's a big island.

2259
02:34:22,298 --> 02:34:26,988
MARISHA: That's the same damn fucking roll. Piece
of shit.

2260
02:34:26,988 --> 02:34:31,842
MATT: Which is good, because the first roll should
have stayed anyway. Works out well.

2261
02:34:31,842 --> 02:34:34,471
MARISHA: Investigation? Seven.

2262
02:34:34,471 --> 02:34:41,078
MATT: Seven. It's hard to tell in the dark,
unfortunately. Your human eyes prevent you from

2263
02:34:41,078 --> 02:34:46,359
finding any details in the vicinity without a
light source. The faint bit of moonlight gives you

2264
02:34:46,359 --> 02:34:50,636
the general structure of the island, but beyond
that, even looking close, you have a hard time

2265
02:34:50,636 --> 02:34:52,317
making out details.

2266
02:34:52,317 --> 02:34:54,362
TRAVIS: How about we fan out and move in?

2267
02:34:54,362 --> 02:34:56,343
LAURA: Okay.

2268
02:34:56,343 --> 02:34:59,800
TRAVIS: Keep a line. Within eye shot of each
other.

2269
02:34:59,800 --> 02:35:02,429
MARISHA: Like looking for drowned kids?

2270
02:35:02,429 --> 02:35:04,126
TRAVIS: Well, yeah.

2271
02:35:04,126 --> 02:35:06,506
MARISHA: Make a line.

2272
02:35:06,506 --> 02:35:09,133
LIAM: Because I can't see anything, I'm going to
hand on your shoulder.

2273
02:35:09,133 --> 02:35:11,341
SAM: Guide you through.

2274
02:35:11,341 --> 02:35:16,366
MATT: Okay. What is the order in which you guys
are walking or fanning out?

2275
02:35:16,366 --> 02:35:19,390
SAM: The exact order that our minis are, right
there.

2276
02:35:19,390 --> 02:35:21,196
MARISHA: You know, it kind of works.

2277
02:35:21,196 --> 02:35:22,859
TRAVIS: Put me next to Beau.

2278
02:35:22,859 --> 02:35:26,145
TALIESIN: Let's put the humans in the middle, so that
they can't be surprised.

2279
02:35:26,145 --> 02:35:30,216
MARISHA: Put Fjord on the outside. There we go.

2280
02:35:30,216 --> 02:35:31,966
SAM: Well, not the exact order.

2281
02:35:31,966 --> 02:35:37,308
LIAM: Do we want to do it like a V-formation, with
Nott in the lead and the two humans just behind?

2282
02:35:37,308 --> 02:35:40,738
SAM: We're fine like this.

2283
02:35:40,738 --> 02:35:45,212
LAURA: Nott should be next to Caleb, because he
can't see. So Nott should be right next to Caleb.

2284
02:35:45,212 --> 02:35:47,227
TRAVIS: Jester and Nott switch.

2285
02:35:47,227 --> 02:35:51,342
MARISHA: Just don't spread out too far to where
we're not in shouting distance.

2286
02:35:51,342 --> 02:35:54,312
LAURA: Okay. So we spread.

2287
02:35:54,312 --> 02:35:57,271
MATT: Technically, you're in the-- We'll go with
this.

2288
02:35:57,271 --> 02:35:59,093
ALL: It's fine.

2289
02:35:59,093 --> 02:36:00,836
SAM: We're all going to die anyway.

2290
02:36:00,836 --> 02:36:02,355
TALIESIN: Again.

2291
02:36:02,355 --> 02:36:09,701
MATT: You guys all carefully make your way into
the treeline. The smell here is definitely that of

2292
02:36:09,701 --> 02:36:18,178
low tide. You get that unearthing of sediment, and
the occasional whiff of dead fish.

2293
02:36:18,178 --> 02:36:20,497
LAURA: Do we smell any brimstone?

2294
02:36:20,497 --> 02:36:25,001
MATT: No, not at the moment. You guys push further
in. Are you being quiet about this?

2295
02:36:25,001 --> 02:36:26,400
ALL: Yeah.

2296
02:36:26,400 --> 02:36:29,737
MATT: Then I would like you all to make a stealth
check.

2297
02:36:29,737 --> 02:36:31,618
TALIESIN: Hey! There's my good roll!

2298
02:36:31,618 --> 02:36:34,436
MARISHA: That's all right.

2299
02:36:34,436 --> 02:36:36,138
LAURA: 17.

2300
02:36:36,138 --> 02:36:37,246
TALIESIN: 19.

2301
02:36:37,246 --> 02:36:38,422
TRAVIS: 16.

2302
02:36:38,422 --> 02:36:39,415
MARISHA: 17.

2303
02:36:39,415 --> 02:36:40,313
LIAM: 15.

2304
02:36:40,313 --> 02:36:41,234
SAM: 16.

2305
02:36:41,234 --> 02:36:42,692
MATT and TRAVIS: Wow!

2306
02:36:42,692 --> 02:36:45,487
TALIESIN: There's that magic we never had.

2307
02:36:45,487 --> 02:36:51,857
MATT: As you guys slowly become a cohesive unit, a
true adventuring party, you begin to carefully

2308
02:36:51,857 --> 02:37:02,435
make your way through. Thankfully, most of the
small tree cluster, this small glade, the floor of

2309
02:37:02,435 --> 02:37:07,617
it is soft, and as you step, there's no heavy
snapping of twigs or crumbling of leaves.

2310
02:37:07,617 --> 02:37:15,533
Something does catch the edge of your foot on the
outskirts, Fjord, as you glance down. You see what

2311
02:37:15,533 --> 02:37:24,410
looks to be two crustacean shells: small crabs
that have been fished out of the nearby lake, and

2312
02:37:24,410 --> 02:37:29,133
have been completely eaten. The inside has been
cleared out.

2313
02:37:29,133 --> 02:37:34,362
TRAVIS: Hold for a second. These shells have been
devoured.

2314
02:37:34,362 --> 02:37:38,580
MARISHA: Oh. I pass it down the line. The shells
have been devoured!

2315
02:37:38,580 --> 02:37:40,774
LIAM: The bells have been deflowered.

2316
02:37:40,774 --> 02:37:47,094
SAM: The whales are in my power!

2317
02:37:47,094 --> 02:37:51,737
LAURA: The veils are covered in flour.

2318
02:37:51,737 --> 02:37:57,623
(laughter)

2319
02:37:57,623 --> 02:38:00,373
MATT: Something about being deflowered.

2320
02:38:00,373 --> 02:38:03,252
SAM: Did Toya love crabs?

2321
02:38:03,252 --> 02:38:12,799
TALIESIN: She ate what was put in front of her. We
ate what was put in front of us. We're not picky people.

2322
02:38:12,799 --> 02:38:20,908
MATT: You guys continue about 30 or so feet into
the treeline, before you start finding, I wouldn't

2323
02:38:20,908 --> 02:38:27,213
say a clearing, but the trees aren't as closely
placed together. There is some semblance of an

2324
02:38:27,213 --> 02:38:28,890
opening here and there.

2325
02:38:28,890 --> 02:38:29,826
SAM: What?

2326
02:38:29,826 --> 02:38:31,366
LAURA: Stop burping! Yes you did!

2327
02:38:31,366 --> 02:38:32,453
SAM: I didn't burp!

2328
02:38:32,453 --> 02:38:33,787
LAURA: You probably just breathed out hard.

2329
02:38:33,787 --> 02:38:36,529
LIAM: I'm sorry, it was me.

2330
02:38:36,529 --> 02:38:38,534
SAM: That was you?!

2331
02:38:38,534 --> 02:38:40,370
LIAM: No, I meant Caleb's stink.

2332
02:38:40,370 --> 02:38:43,327
SAM: I have not burped.

2333
02:38:43,327 --> 02:38:48,528
TALIESIN: I'm trying to keep an eye out for
anything.

2334
02:38:48,528 --> 02:38:55,935
MATT: Unfortunately, you're having a hard time to
make out any sign. You guys make your way towards

2335
02:38:55,935 --> 02:38:59,168
the center of this cluster of trees.

2336
02:38:59,168 --> 02:39:03,838
MARISHA: As we walk, Fjord and I will keep a
lookout for any more crustacean empty shells.

2337
02:39:03,838 --> 02:39:10,383
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check. Well, one of
you do, the other can aid if you want to, and that

2338
02:39:10,383 --> 02:39:11,933
gives you advantage on the roll.

2339
02:39:11,933 --> 02:39:14,120
MARISHA: Help me. I get advantage?

2340
02:39:14,120 --> 02:39:15,342
MATT: Yeah.

2341
02:39:15,342 --> 02:39:21,102
MARISHA: Thank god you're helping me. Just
perception? 20 total.

2342
02:39:21,102 --> 02:39:30,750
MATT: You don't see any more crab shells, but you
do glance a bit ahead, and amongst the trees, you

2343
02:39:30,750 --> 02:39:42,335
can see stonework. Stones stacked in a wall that
is toppled over and fallen. A small ruin. Some

2344
02:39:42,335 --> 02:39:47,931
sort of a structure, once a single-story structure
that seems to have fallen inward and been

2345
02:39:47,931 --> 02:39:53,291
destroyed. Partially overgrown, and what little
moonlight comes through, you can make out the

2346
02:39:53,291 --> 02:39:58,951
shape of it. There's corners still standing, but
other than that, it looks like it's been toppled

2347
02:39:58,951 --> 02:40:01,155
over and left to ruin.

2348
02:40:01,155 --> 02:40:05,723
MARISHA: Is that a cave? I think your eyes are
better than mine.

2349
02:40:05,723 --> 02:40:09,728
TRAVIS. Yeah. With my darkvision, can I zero-in on
what she's looking at?

2350
02:40:09,728 --> 02:40:11,149
MATT: If you get a little closer, you can, yeah.

2351
02:40:11,149 --> 02:40:12,298
TRAVIS: I scoot up a little bit.

2352
02:40:12,298 --> 02:40:20,010
MATT: Okay. You creep up and you can see it's a
ruined building. It looks like it was 30 feet on

2353
02:40:20,010 --> 02:40:26,149
one side, 15 feet on the other. It's destroyed.

2354
02:40:26,149 --> 02:40:30,287
TRAVIS: I can see why they say a witch was here.
It's pretty spooky in this light.

2355
02:40:30,287 --> 02:40:34,837
TALIESIN: Even if we weren't here on business, I
really want to see this.

2356
02:40:34,837 --> 02:40:36,530
LAURA: Can we sneak around the hut?

2357
02:40:36,530 --> 02:40:39,152
MARISHA: Can we surround the hut?

2358
02:40:39,152 --> 02:40:41,844
MATT: There's no hut. It's a ruin.

2359
02:40:41,844 --> 02:40:43,673
LAURA: Can we sneak around the ruin?

2360
02:40:43,673 --> 02:40:47,161
MARISHA: We're building a narrative here that Matt
is not giving us.

2361
02:40:47,161 --> 02:40:51,818
MATT: Like The Secret. You're manifesting a witch
fight here. "Where's the hut?"

2362
02:40:51,818 --> 02:40:56,374
TRAVIS: Let's approach.

2363
02:40:56,374 --> 02:41:02,120
MATT: You guys approach. Who's keeping visual
point on this?

2364
02:41:02,120 --> 02:41:05,336
MARISHA: Who's got better eyes?

2365
02:41:05,336 --> 02:41:08,501
TRAVIS, TALIESIN, and LAURA: I have darkvision.

2366
02:41:08,501 --> 02:41:11,188
LIAM: I'm moving slow on purpose at the back of
the group now.

2367
02:41:11,188 --> 02:41:12,712
TRAVIS: Which means you are, too.

2368
02:41:12,712 --> 02:41:17,559
MATT: Who's helming this? I'll give one of you a
perception roll to help on this.

2369
02:41:17,559 --> 02:41:18,795
TRAVIS: Go for it, Molly.

2370
02:41:18,795 --> 02:41:20,540
LAURA: No, we're pointing at you.

2371
02:41:20,540 --> 02:41:22,800
TRAVIS: You're pointing at me? I don't want
perception, you want Beau.

2372
02:41:22,800 --> 02:41:26,976
MATT: Technically, I should have given Beau
disadvantage because of her human eyes. I let it

2373
02:41:26,976 --> 02:41:28,658
slide because you were looking for crustaceans.

2374
02:41:28,658 --> 02:41:31,867
LAURA: I'll do it! Because I like witch huts, I'll
do it. What's yours?

2375
02:41:31,867 --> 02:41:33,982
TALIESIN: I'll do it.

2376
02:41:33,982 --> 02:41:36,418
MATT: I'm not used to you being a human.

2377
02:41:36,418 --> 02:41:38,105
MARISHA: He basically saw it.

2378
02:41:38,105 --> 02:41:40,031
MATT: I know. It worked out fine for the
narrative.

2379
02:41:40,031 --> 02:41:42,212
TALIESIN: I'll go for it. I don't get advantage on
this.

2380
02:41:42,212 --> 02:41:43,327
MATT: No.

2381
02:41:43,327 --> 02:41:48,023
TALIESIN: No, okay. God. Six.

2382
02:41:48,023 --> 02:41:52,704
MATT: It's too dark to see anything, even with
your darkvision. It looks like a ruin. It could

2383
02:41:52,704 --> 02:41:54,605
very well be that this island is abandoned.

2384
02:41:54,605 --> 02:41:59,057
MARISHA: Does it look like, when we get up close
to it, like it's caved in on top?

2385
02:41:59,057 --> 02:42:04,098
MATT: It looks like whatever roof was has fallen
in, and all there are are some semblances of the

2386
02:42:04,098 --> 02:42:08,539
wall still standing, and corners to the structure,
but most of it is either crumbled in entirely--

2387
02:42:08,539 --> 02:42:13,320
LIAM: Yeah, this is like a famine home in Ireland.
You can see the edges of it, probably.

2388
02:42:13,320 --> 02:42:14,448
MATT: Yep.

2389
02:42:14,448 --> 02:42:15,929
MARISHA: Fjord, give me a boost.

2390
02:42:15,929 --> 02:42:17,375
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure.

2391
02:42:17,375 --> 02:42:21,258
MARISHA: Getting up on the roof.

2392
02:42:21,258 --> 02:42:26,932
MATT: Okay. You climb up onto-- there is no roof
to it, per se. It's all fallen in.

2393
02:42:26,932 --> 02:42:29,700
SAM: There's a full hut with a witch inside,
Matt.

2394
02:42:29,700 --> 02:42:33,799
(laughter)

2395
02:42:33,799 --> 02:42:38,974
MATT: You want me to put a witch in this? You want
me to throw a witch in this? There can be a witch, Sam!

2396
02:42:38,974 --> 02:42:41,472
SAM: There's a full, two-story hut with a burning
fireplace.

2397
02:42:41,472 --> 02:42:43,483
LIAM: I'll pull out the Baba Yaga, give me five
seconds.

2398
02:42:43,483 --> 02:42:46,252
MATT: I got rules for this shit in the book.

2399
02:42:46,252 --> 02:42:49,130
MARISHA: You hear a dice fall, "And... six witches
come out."

2400
02:42:49,130 --> 02:42:58,591
MATT: Yeah, going back to my first campaign. Roll
for number of witches. As you vault up to the top

2401
02:42:58,591 --> 02:43:06,240
edge of one of the stronger walls, you head up
onto the side and glance to the back, right as a

2402
02:43:06,240 --> 02:43:10,775
pair of red eyes (whoosh) right up at you, and
this (growling).

2403
02:43:10,775 --> 02:43:13,428
TRAVIS: We know that sound.

2404
02:43:13,428 --> 02:43:15,677
MATT: I need you to roll initiative.

2405
02:43:15,677 --> 02:43:18,398
TALIESIN: I did not sneak that in, did I?

2406
02:43:18,398 --> 02:43:19,730
MATT: Nope.

2407
02:43:19,730 --> 02:43:21,153
SAM: Everybody, or just her?

2408
02:43:21,153 --> 02:43:22,457
MATT: All of you.

2409
02:43:22,457 --> 02:43:23,725
LAURA: All of us?

2410
02:43:23,725 --> 02:43:27,404
(cheering)

2411
02:43:27,404 --> 02:43:30,678
MARISHA: Which dice? I haven't rolled this dice
yet. Maybe it will be kind.

2412
02:43:30,678 --> 02:43:33,782
SAM: Look at this well-constructed map.

2413
02:43:33,782 --> 02:43:36,656
LIAM: Oh, shit snacks.

2414
02:43:36,656 --> 02:43:38,248
MATT: There's Beau, right there.

2415
02:43:38,248 --> 02:43:39,536
TRAVIS: Look at the size of that.

2416
02:43:39,536 --> 02:43:41,728
LIAM: Look, you're up in the air, bro!

2417
02:43:41,728 --> 02:43:43,542
LAURA: And little Toya.

2418
02:43:43,542 --> 02:43:46,477
MATT: Whereabouts are you guys, currently?

2419
02:43:46,477 --> 02:43:49,025
LIAM: I would be the furthest back.

2420
02:43:49,025 --> 02:43:51,923
MARISHA: Fjord's right next to me.

2421
02:43:51,923 --> 02:43:53,741
LAURA: Me and Molly were closer to it.

2422
02:43:53,741 --> 02:43:57,140
MATT: Fjord's right there, giving you the boost
up. You and Molly were close to it?

2423
02:43:57,140 --> 02:44:00,110
LAURA: Closer than Caleb. Yeah, that's good.

2424
02:44:00,110 --> 02:44:04,924
MATT: You guys are next to each other, because
you're holding there. Molly moved up to probably

2425
02:44:04,924 --> 02:44:06,620
here. Around there?

2426
02:44:06,620 --> 02:44:08,236
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm all right with that.

2427
02:44:08,236 --> 02:44:09,386
LAURA: Yes, I'm good.

2428
02:44:09,386 --> 02:44:10,797
MATT: Okay.

2429
02:44:10,797 --> 02:44:19,513
TRAVIS: The trees are awesome. Oh man! That
fucking music.

2430
02:44:19,513 --> 02:44:25,429
MATT: Let's go ahead and-- oh shit, okay.

2431
02:44:25,429 --> 02:44:29,359
LAURA: Oh no, they rolled really well.

2432
02:44:29,359 --> 02:44:31,680
SAM: They? It's just one.

2433
02:44:31,680 --> 02:44:33,293
LAURA: Toya's there too.

2434
02:44:33,293 --> 02:44:35,409
SAM: Toya's just a dwarf girl.

2435
02:44:35,409 --> 02:44:37,118
LAURA: She's going to pull out some shit.

2436
02:44:37,118 --> 02:44:38,533
MARISHA: Yeah she is, don't trust that bitch.

2437
02:44:38,533 --> 02:44:45,761
MATT: 25 to 20, anybody? Nott, since you got
high-- You got higher than that last time. 20 to 15?

2438
02:44:45,761 --> 02:44:47,366
TALIESIN: 18.

2439
02:44:47,366 --> 02:44:48,817
MARISHA: 16.

2440
02:44:48,817 --> 02:44:59,727
MATT: Hold on. We have Molly up front at 18. Who's
next after that?

2441
02:44:59,727 --> 02:45:01,761
MARISHA and LAURA: 16.

2442
02:45:01,761 --> 02:45:04,258
LIAM: I'm at 15.

2443
02:45:04,258 --> 02:45:07,329
TRAVIS: You and Frumpkin?

2444
02:45:07,329 --> 02:45:12,779
MATT: For the ease of this, we're going to run
with Frumpkin on your initiative order because

2445
02:45:12,779 --> 02:45:15,211
otherwise it's another initiative we have to worry
about.

2446
02:45:15,211 --> 02:45:16,942
LIAM: So keep him with me?

2447
02:45:16,942 --> 02:45:23,094
MATT: Yeah. All right, so, Caleb. 15 to ten?

2448
02:45:23,094 --> 02:45:25,397
SAM: 11!

2449
02:45:25,397 --> 02:45:28,585
MATT: All right, Nott. What did you get, Fjord?

2450
02:45:28,585 --> 02:45:29,689
TRAVIS: Five.

2451
02:45:29,689 --> 02:45:31,132
LAURA: Oh no.

2452
02:45:31,132 --> 02:45:35,636
SAM: Wait, you can't see because you're looking
through the sparrow, or because you're a human?

2453
02:45:35,636 --> 02:45:36,957
LIAM: I'm human.

2454
02:45:36,957 --> 02:45:38,622
SAM: That's why we're holding hands?

2455
02:45:38,622 --> 02:45:40,225
LIAM: We're not holding hands anymore.

2456
02:45:40,225 --> 02:45:44,511
MATT: Top of the combat round. Molly, you hear
this growl, and you watch Beau begin to react and

2457
02:45:44,511 --> 02:45:48,207
get the staff ready and you immediately know this
is not good, but you're up first.

2458
02:45:48,207 --> 02:45:52,210
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull out both my swords,
and I'm going to drag them--

2459
02:45:52,210 --> 02:45:54,275
LAURA and MARISHA: [imitating him] Borth your
swords!

2460
02:45:54,275 --> 02:45:55,792
SAM: Irish, Laura.

2461
02:45:55,792 --> 02:45:58,783
TALIESIN: I'm not doing my accent right now. So
I'm going to pull out both the swords, and I'm

2462
02:45:58,783 --> 02:46:03,124
going to drag them on the back of my neck, and
before the blood even begins to pour, it goes

2463
02:46:03,124 --> 02:46:05,692
straight into ice along the blades.

2464
02:46:05,692 --> 02:46:07,193
TRAVIS: Sick.

2465
02:46:07,193 --> 02:46:10,042
MATT: You can only apply one per round on a bonus
action.

2466
02:46:10,042 --> 02:46:11,183
TALIESIN: Action, bonus action.

2467
02:46:11,183 --> 02:46:12,431
MATT: Oh, you're doing both right now?

2468
02:46:12,431 --> 02:46:13,606
TALIESIN: Action and bonus action.

2469
02:46:13,606 --> 02:46:15,471
MATT: Technically it's a bonus action; you can't
convert an action to a bonus action.

2470
02:46:15,471 --> 02:46:16,933
TALIESIN: I can't turn an action to a bonus
action?

2471
02:46:16,933 --> 02:46:18,147
MATT: No. Unfortunately.

2472
02:46:18,147 --> 02:46:19,235
TALIESIN: All right, that's fair.

2473
02:46:19,235 --> 02:46:22,910
MATT: Yeah, you could apply it once, and then you
still have your action if you want to.

2474
02:46:22,910 --> 02:46:24,467
TALIESIN: Okay.

2475
02:46:24,467 --> 02:46:29,033
MATT: You can mark down, you take down your
temporary hit points or your max hit points to 22.

2476
02:46:29,033 --> 02:46:36,586
TALIESIN: I'm going to move around and I'm going
to try and get a little cover right here.

2477
02:46:36,586 --> 02:46:38,490
MATT: Okay. You move there?

2478
02:46:38,490 --> 02:46:43,683
TALIESIN: I'm going to move there, and I'm going
to hold my attack until there's something to hit.

2479
02:46:43,683 --> 02:46:52,707
I'm going to try and make a little wave at Yasha.
Toya. Ah, brain.

2480
02:46:52,707 --> 02:46:56,467
MATT: It is now Kylre's turn.

2481
02:46:56,467 --> 02:46:58,832
TRAVIS: Oh, shit, right away.

2482
02:46:58,832 --> 02:47:06,539
MATT: All right, seeing you right there, the devil
toad turns to little Toya to the side, who looks a

2483
02:47:06,539 --> 02:47:15,240
bit dirtied at a glance, and goes, "They're trying
to take you away. Come, sing for us! Stop them!"

2484
02:47:15,240 --> 02:47:19,168
MARISHA: I look down at Fjord and I go: let me
down! Help me down!

2485
02:47:19,168 --> 02:47:20,595
TRAVIS: What?

2486
02:47:20,595 --> 02:47:33,999
MATT: All right. The devil toad is going to
straight leap, which would pass through your-- you

2487
02:47:33,999 --> 02:47:39,627
get an attack of opportunity-- and land right
there.

2488
02:47:39,627 --> 02:47:41,999
TRAVIS: Look at the size of that thing.

2489
02:47:41,999 --> 02:47:43,723
MATT: Make your attack, if you want to.

2490
02:47:43,723 --> 02:47:46,670
MARISHA: I can't really do anything; it's just a
whack, right?

2491
02:47:46,670 --> 02:47:48,828
MATT: It's just a hit with your staff, yeah.

2492
02:47:48,828 --> 02:47:50,696
MARISHA: Okay, 21.

2493
02:47:50,696 --> 02:47:52,262
MATT: That hits! Go ahead and roll damage.

2494
02:47:52,262 --> 02:47:54,695
MARISHA: Just with my staff, right?

2495
02:47:54,695 --> 02:47:56,309
MATT: Correct.

2496
02:47:56,309 --> 02:47:59,161
MARISHA: Not great. Seven points of damage.

2497
02:47:59,161 --> 02:48:05,120
MATT: Seven points of damage. You smack it on the
way, with this horrible wet thud to the back of its

2498
02:48:05,120 --> 02:48:09,917
body, but it moves through with immense speed,
especially with the density and the weight of this

2499
02:48:09,917 --> 02:48:16,159
thing as it lands, the ground shakes in the area,
the vicinity, and as it lands, it uses its action

2500
02:48:16,159 --> 02:48:17,760
to Summon Devil.

2501
02:48:17,760 --> 02:48:20,288
MARISHA: Summon Devil?

2502
02:48:20,288 --> 02:48:28,026
MATT: As it lands, it begins to mutter a language
under its breath. Anybody here speak Infernal?

2503
02:48:28,026 --> 02:48:29,325
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2504
02:48:29,325 --> 02:48:36,244
MATT: You hear an incantation that essentially
amounts to a faint, "Come, protect me, brothers,"

2505
02:48:36,244 --> 02:48:39,509
beneath its breath, and three bursts of flame.

2506
02:48:39,509 --> 02:48:41,893
SAM: Three!? Not three!

2507
02:48:41,893 --> 02:48:45,435
MATT: As three imps apparate in the vicinity.

2508
02:48:45,435 --> 02:48:46,824
MARISHA: Fucking imps!

2509
02:48:46,824 --> 02:48:55,534
MATT: Here and here. Roll their initiative. Okay.

2510
02:48:55,534 --> 02:48:58,323
LAURA: (singing) We're fucked. We're fucked.

2511
02:48:58,323 --> 02:49:03,436
TRAVIS: So excited right now!

2512
02:49:03,436 --> 02:49:07,436
MATT: That's his action, and Toya's up next! Toya
actually rolled initiative just below.

2513
02:49:07,436 --> 02:49:09,752
TRAVIS: She wants to be our friend.

2514
02:49:09,752 --> 02:49:22,064
MATT: Toya is looking around, looking scared,
looking at you motioning towards her. (sung note)

2515
02:49:22,064 --> 02:49:27,736
Her haunting voice begins to spread from her and I
need all of you to make a wisdom saving throw, please.

2516
02:49:27,736 --> 02:49:29,976
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

2517
02:49:29,976 --> 02:49:32,562
SAM: 15.

2518
02:49:32,562 --> 02:49:35,681
MARISHA: Also 15.

2519
02:49:35,681 --> 02:49:37,061
TALIESIN: 20.

2520
02:49:37,061 --> 02:49:39,917
TRAVIS: 17. Natural 17.

2521
02:49:39,917 --> 02:49:41,351
LIAM: 20.

2522
02:49:41,351 --> 02:49:42,760
SAM: Still 15.

2523
02:49:42,760 --> 02:49:44,537
LAURA: Nine.

2524
02:49:44,537 --> 02:49:52,740
MATT: Okay. That's some good saving throws, guys.
All of you shake your head and back away. You:

2525
02:49:52,740 --> 02:49:59,457
your eyes move towards her, and there's an
enchantment that pulls your attention. You have

2526
02:49:59,457 --> 02:50:05,530
disadvantage on any attack rolls you make for the
next turn. She, scared, sees you, and begins to

2527
02:50:05,530 --> 02:50:11,651
walk back this way and hide behind the wall, but
continues to sing, giving this aura in the

2528
02:50:11,651 --> 02:50:15,910
vicinity. That ends Toya's turn. Beau, you're up,
as well as Jester.

2529
02:50:15,910 --> 02:50:20,773
LAURA: I'm going to Invoke Duplicity.

2530
02:50:20,773 --> 02:50:24,106
MATT: So that's your action? Where are you placing
your--?

2531
02:50:24,106 --> 02:50:27,447
LAURA: So she can appear anywhere?

2532
02:50:27,447 --> 02:50:32,050
MATT: Let me see real fast. Still getting used to
these new abilities.

2533
02:50:32,050 --> 02:50:37,059
SAM: Use your D&D Next to look at the information
about that spell.

2534
02:50:37,059 --> 02:50:39,628
MATT: It appears anywhere within 30 feet of you in
an unoccupied space.

2535
02:50:39,628 --> 02:50:47,944
LAURA: Tight. Okay, she's going to appear in the
tree in front of me. Next to Fjord.

2536
02:50:47,944 --> 02:50:51,209
SAM: Wait, did you have two minis made for
yourself?

2537
02:50:51,209 --> 02:50:54,185
LAURA: No, Matt did the second one! Isn't that
cool!?

2538
02:50:54,185 --> 02:50:55,968
SAM: Ah, wow.

2539
02:50:55,968 --> 02:51:07,451
LAURA: Then as me, I'm going to run away. Can I
run behind a tree and crouch?

2540
02:51:07,451 --> 02:51:09,518
MATT: You can go around this one there.

2541
02:51:09,518 --> 02:51:11,025
LAURA: I'm going to crouch behind it.

2542
02:51:11,025 --> 02:51:14,199
MATT: That gives you some cover. That's your turn.
Beau, you're up.

2543
02:51:14,199 --> 02:51:15,752
LAURA: That's my turn.

2544
02:51:15,752 --> 02:51:24,693
MARISHA: I'm going to vault off of the platform
that I'm on, and I'm going to go for Toya. I'm

2545
02:51:24,693 --> 02:51:30,691
going to take my bo staff. I'm going to try and
take her where her throat is and grapple her down

2546
02:51:30,691 --> 02:51:36,182
to the ground. Like to basically throat crush and
get on top of her.

2547
02:51:36,182 --> 02:51:37,533
MATT: All right, make an acrobatics check.

2548
02:51:37,533 --> 02:51:38,955
TRAVIS: Little larynx assault.

2549
02:51:38,955 --> 02:51:42,223
LAURA: I feel like Beau will have far less
problems hurting children.

2550
02:51:42,223 --> 02:51:48,085
MARISHA: Yeah. Okay. 15.

2551
02:51:48,085 --> 02:51:54,866
MATT: Yeah. You make the landing, roll, and go
towards her. You're going to use your action to grapple?

2552
02:51:54,866 --> 02:51:56,260
MARISHA: Grapple her down.

2553
02:51:56,260 --> 02:51:58,609
MATT: Go ahead and make an athletics check,
please.

2554
02:51:58,609 --> 02:52:04,464
LIAM: Put her in a body bag, Johnny!

2555
02:52:04,464 --> 02:52:07,268
TRAVIS: That was so close.

2556
02:52:07,268 --> 02:52:15,387
MARISHA: It's a 14. Yeah, I know, you can barely
see that one. Athletics you said? 19. 18, sorry!

2557
02:52:15,387 --> 02:52:22,916
MATT: As you land, you manage to grapple Toya and
using the staff you press her against the wall,

2558
02:52:22,916 --> 02:52:30,310
and the scared dwarf girl's eyes are open wide.
The singing falters for a second, but she

2559
02:52:30,310 --> 02:52:33,422
continues to still sing, and you see her eyes
looking around desperately for--

2560
02:52:33,422 --> 02:52:34,658
MARISHA: Do I have a bonus?

2561
02:52:34,658 --> 02:52:36,503
MATT: I mean, you have a bonus action, yes.

2562
02:52:36,503 --> 02:52:39,888
MARISHA: Can I crush in a little bit further and
get her to stop singing?

2563
02:52:39,888 --> 02:52:41,380
TALIESIN: I'm so proud of you.

2564
02:52:41,380 --> 02:52:43,195
SAM: Crush that windpipe.

2565
02:52:43,195 --> 02:52:44,893
MARISHA: Just a little!

2566
02:52:44,893 --> 02:52:48,503
MATT: Technically a grapple is an attack, so it's
an attack action, so yeah. You can.

2567
02:52:48,503 --> 02:52:57,378
MARISHA: That's right. Y'all thought Keyleth was a
fuck-up. What am I doing, just a straight attack?

2568
02:52:57,378 --> 02:53:00,603
MATT: Just a straight attack. If you're just
hitting, or pushing ahead with it, I'll say.

2569
02:53:00,603 --> 02:53:01,710
MARISHA: 11.

2570
02:53:01,710 --> 02:53:03,928
MATT: 11? Does not hit, actually.

2571
02:53:04,228 --> 02:53:08,832
LAURA: She's got the strongest windpipe ever.

2572
02:53:08,832 --> 02:53:12,697
MATT: It's more that fact that as you're pressing
in, she's adjusting her body and she's reaching

2573
02:53:12,697 --> 02:53:17,685
up, grabbing, and trying to keep her voice
emitting from her throat. You can't seem to get a

2574
02:53:17,685 --> 02:53:22,887
beat to press. She looks genuinely really scared
and freaking out at being put in this position.

2575
02:53:22,887 --> 02:53:26,867
MARISHA: I'm just going to say: I felt bad for you
before, but now you <i>should</i> be scared.

2576
02:53:26,867 --> 02:53:33,218
MATT: Okay. That ends Beau's turn. Caleb, you're
up.

2577
02:53:33,218 --> 02:53:36,967
LIAM: Question: is the humans' visibility shit
right now?

2578
02:53:36,967 --> 02:53:38,485
MATT: Yeah, there's no light in here.

2579
02:53:38,485 --> 02:53:40,710
LIAM: So I can't see what I'm doing, right?

2580
02:53:40,710 --> 02:53:43,372
MATT: Most any roll you'd be making would be at
disadvantage.

2581
02:53:43,372 --> 02:53:50,758
LIAM: Okay, so four globules of light go (popping)
out of my hands and one of them hovers--

2582
02:53:50,758 --> 02:53:56,979
MATT: Actually, we have a light for this. Forgot
about that! I should've put that on. Hints of

2583
02:53:56,979 --> 02:53:58,070
moonlight.

2584
02:53:58,070 --> 02:54:02,748
LIAM: It's a row of four globules of light. One is
hanging above where my miniature is now. One is

2585
02:54:02,948 --> 02:54:07,937
closer to froggy. One is, like a line over the
building, so that there's one also hanging over

2586
02:54:07,937 --> 02:54:09,574
Beauregard.

2587
02:54:09,574 --> 02:54:15,209
MATT: We'll say within this vicinity here, the
entire center of the island now glows. You can see

2588
02:54:15,209 --> 02:54:19,911
the ruins casting shadows off against the rocks in
the vicinity from where each globe is placed. You

2589
02:54:19,911 --> 02:54:23,451
all have a pretty good view of the battlefield at
the moment.

2590
02:54:23,451 --> 02:54:28,922
LIAM: With my remaining movement, I'm hauling ass
towards Fjord and whichever Jester that is ahead

2591
02:54:28,922 --> 02:54:30,871
of me.

2592
02:54:30,871 --> 02:54:37,114
MATT: You can get right behind Fjord if you want
to. That ends Caleb's turn. Nott, you're up.

2593
02:54:37,114 --> 02:54:43,843
SAM: Okay. Seeing where Caleb has run-- If I move,
will that imp next to me get an attack?

2594
02:54:43,843 --> 02:54:45,217
MATT: One way to find out.

2595
02:54:45,217 --> 02:54:51,773
SAM: Okay. Well then, I will turn to the imp next
to me and I will slash at it with my shortsword.

2596
02:54:51,773 --> 02:54:53,199
MATT: Okay, go for it.

2597
02:54:54,547 --> 02:54:56,311
SAM: Two.

2598
02:54:56,311 --> 02:54:57,816
LAURA: Don't you add something?

2599
02:54:57,816 --> 02:54:59,321
SAM: Two plus six. Eight.

2600
02:54:59,321 --> 02:55:00,826
MATT: Eight.

2601
02:55:00,830 --> 02:55:05,286
MATT: As you swing wide, it flaps its wings
backward and the tiny demonic humanoid creature

2602
02:55:05,286 --> 02:55:08,627
with its wings in the air goes (cackling).

2603
02:55:08,997 --> 02:55:13,393
SAM: All right, I will bonus action disengage and
run to Caleb.

2604
02:55:13,393 --> 02:55:15,503
MATT: Okay, there's that.

2605
02:55:15,503 --> 02:55:17,240
TRAVIS: Disengage, baby!

2606
02:55:17,240 --> 02:55:19,274
LIAM: So proud! So proud!

2607
02:55:19,274 --> 02:55:21,014
MATT: Okay, so you're all clustered up here behind
the ruins.

2608
02:55:21,014 --> 02:55:22,319
LAURA: So smart.

2609
02:55:22,319 --> 02:55:24,495
SAM: They can't get us over here.

2610
02:55:24,495 --> 02:55:26,928
(laughter)

2611
02:55:26,928 --> 02:55:30,998
MATT: All right, so that finishes your turn, Nott.
Fjord, you're up.

2612
02:55:30,998 --> 02:55:34,018
TRAVIS: Over the top of the ruins, can I see the
hellish toad?

2613
02:55:34,018 --> 02:55:37,548
MATT: You can. With the light that's burning up
there, it only goes about maybe five or six feet

2614
02:55:37,548 --> 02:55:39,500
there. You have a good view of the creature.

2615
02:55:39,500 --> 02:55:43,687
TRAVIS: Can I use for my bonus action my
Hexblade's Curse?

2616
02:55:43,687 --> 02:55:45,298
MATT: That you can!

2617
02:55:45,298 --> 02:55:47,797
TALIESIN: What?! Hexblade's Curse?

2618
02:55:47,797 --> 02:55:55,306
TRAVIS: I gain bonus to my damage rolls. A 19 or a
20 is a crit. When it dies, I might get something.

2619
02:55:55,306 --> 02:56:04,200
MATT: As you focus on it, and you condense your
attention, you guys watch as the blade in Fjord's

2620
02:56:04,200 --> 02:56:14,389
hand shimmers slightly. What was previously a
faint bit of polished metallic suddenly begins to

2621
02:56:14,389 --> 02:56:20,789
grow something organic looking. A cluster of
barnacles begin to appear out of the hilt of the

2622
02:56:20,789 --> 02:56:26,250
weapon and curl down about three or four inches
down the blade, and it begins to drip water,

2623
02:56:26,250 --> 02:56:33,553
sourceless. Like it was freshly pulled out of the
ocean. The shadows that had been drawn from the

2624
02:56:33,553 --> 02:56:40,648
nearby bits of stonework begin to tear into the
body of the devil toad who looks around at the

2625
02:56:40,648 --> 02:56:47,374
ground as there's now this squirrely swirling bit
of black energy that's wrapping around and causing

2626
02:56:47,374 --> 02:56:51,583
it to look about confused at its torso. That's
your bonus action.

2627
02:56:51,583 --> 02:56:55,425
TRAVIS: I'm coming for you. I'll roll around the
right side so I can see Toya.

2628
02:56:55,425 --> 02:56:56,383
MATT: All right.

2629
02:56:56,383 --> 02:57:02,522
TRAVIS: I'll use Eldritch Blast at Toya being held
down by Beau.

2630
02:57:04,112 --> 02:57:06,717
MARISHA: He gets advantage, right, because she's
pinned?

2631
02:57:06,774 --> 02:57:09,866
MATT: You're shooting Toya? Or are you shooting
the toad?

2632
02:57:09,866 --> 02:57:11,217
TRAVIS: I'm sorry. The toad.

2633
02:57:11,217 --> 02:57:12,892
MARISHA: Oh sorry, sorry, sorry.

2634
02:57:12,892 --> 02:57:17,488
TRAVIS: That is a 19. That is a crit.

2635
02:57:17,664 --> 02:57:19,701
MATT: For the Hexblade's Curse, we'll have to
double check.

2636
02:57:19,701 --> 02:57:21,181
TRAVIS: Oh, it is melee.

2637
02:57:21,181 --> 02:57:23,935
MATT: It is for your melee. I don't think it's for
spells unfortunately.

2638
02:57:23,935 --> 02:57:28,556
TRAVIS: That's right. It is melee. Yeah, I'm
staying right there. Plus six, so that's a 25.

2639
02:57:28,556 --> 02:57:31,542
MATT: Yeah, that hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

2640
02:57:31,542 --> 02:57:35,177
SAM: Every time he casts a spell, does it go
(sings Dueling Banjos).

2641
02:57:35,177 --> 02:57:37,598
(laughter)

2642
02:57:38,941 --> 02:57:43,092
TRAVIS: 13, 14, 15.

2643
02:57:43,092 --> 02:57:45,830
MATT: 15?! Slick.

2644
02:57:45,830 --> 02:57:48,758
LIAM: From that blast? Sick.

2645
02:57:48,758 --> 02:57:50,241
MATT: Because it's plus--?

2646
02:57:50,241 --> 02:57:53,209
TRAVIS: 1d8 plus four, plus two for the Hexblade's
Curse.

2647
02:57:53,209 --> 02:57:56,169
MATT: The hexblade-- is that also for a melee
weapon though?

2648
02:57:57,559 --> 02:58:02,211
TRAVIS: Bonus to damage rolls against the cursed
target. It equals my proficiency bonus.

2649
02:58:02,454 --> 02:58:10,699
MATT: Great, yeah. That's 15? With that as you
snipe through the pommel of your blade, the energy

2650
02:58:10,699 --> 02:58:16,258
blast strikes and the toad-- as it impacts, the
shadows seem to grab the bolts of energy and tear

2651
02:58:16,258 --> 02:58:20,915
them back towards it's torso causing additional
damage as it (grunts in pain).

2652
02:58:20,915 --> 02:58:24,103
TRAVIS: Can I use the rest of my movement-- yeah,
no, I'm good where I am.

2653
02:58:24,352 --> 02:58:27,766
MATT: Okay. That's the end of your turn. Top of
the round. Now the imps go.

2654
02:58:27,766 --> 02:58:28,986
SAM: Oh boy.

2655
02:58:28,986 --> 02:58:31,093
LAURA: Imps are the top of the round?

2656
02:58:31,093 --> 02:58:32,029
MATT: Yep.

2657
02:58:32,029 --> 02:58:33,719
LAURA: Jeez louise.

2658
02:58:33,719 --> 02:58:35,964
TRAVIS: Times three right?

2659
02:58:35,964 --> 02:58:41,706
LIAM: Nope, that's a mistake. You also don't mean
to do that.

2660
02:58:41,706 --> 02:58:43,899
MATT: Two, three, four.

2661
02:58:43,899 --> 02:58:46,202
TRAVIS: Twenty feet speed.

2662
02:58:46,202 --> 02:58:50,310
MATT: Oh no, it's a 40 foot fly speed!

2663
02:58:50,310 --> 02:58:51,841
(groans)

2664
02:58:51,841 --> 02:58:53,376
MARISHA: Of course it is.

2665
02:58:53,376 --> 02:58:58,050
TALIESIN: Opening your mouth right there. That was
so useful! So useful!

2666
02:58:58,050 --> 02:58:59,471
MATT: All right, cool.

2667
02:58:59,666 --> 02:59:00,915
TRAVIS: My apologies.

2668
02:59:00,915 --> 02:59:04,870
MATT: With that, all three are of
them are going to make a sting strike. That's one

2669
02:59:04,870 --> 02:59:10,660
against you, Caleb. That's a natural three plus
five. That's eight.

2670
02:59:10,660 --> 02:59:12,925
LIAM: Ooh, it almost got me though.

2671
02:59:12,925 --> 02:59:17,373
MATT: Misses you. Against Nott, that-- Jesus.
Nine.

2672
02:59:17,373 --> 02:59:18,619
SAM: No.

2673
02:59:18,619 --> 02:59:21,594
MATT: Then Molly. A 17 plus five.

2674
02:59:21,594 --> 02:59:24,079
TALIESIN: Yep, that hit me.

2675
02:59:24,079 --> 02:59:25,509
(laughter)

2676
02:59:25,509 --> 02:59:28,564
TALIESIN: Actually, is it close enough to me that
I would have taken a swipe at it anyways?

2677
02:59:28,564 --> 02:59:32,086
MATT: You would have. You take your strike as it
comes into range.

2678
02:59:33,757 --> 02:59:36,205
TALIESIN: That's a 13?

2679
02:59:36,205 --> 02:59:38,881
MATT: 13 does hit. Just hits!

2680
02:59:38,881 --> 02:59:50,321
TALIESIN: That's a 1d6 plus 1d4. That's eight
damage plus one cold damage, so nine damage.

2681
02:59:50,321 --> 02:59:57,330
MATT: Nine points of damage. As it swings down
with its wings, you arc out with your scimitar and

2682
02:59:57,330 --> 03:00:02,435
you carve through its body. It looks horribly
hurt, blood spatters across your arm and across

2683
03:00:02,435 --> 03:00:03,894
your forearm from the creature.

2684
03:00:03,894 --> 03:00:10,349
But it still survives and jams its stinger
into you. You suffer from that--

2685
03:00:11,823 --> 03:00:14,260
It's cocked. That is five points of

2686
03:00:14,260 --> 03:00:18,535
piercing damage and you have to make a
constitution saving throw, please.

2687
03:00:18,535 --> 03:00:20,681
TALIESIN: Five points of damage and a constitution
saving throw.

2688
03:00:20,681 --> 03:00:22,652
MATT: Correct.

2689
03:00:23,822 --> 03:00:26,506
TALIESIN: Constitution saving throw.

2690
03:00:32,655 --> 03:00:34,829
Goddamn it. 11.

2691
03:00:34,829 --> 03:00:38,416
MATT: 11 is just what you need to succeed! You
only suffer four points of poison damage.

2692
03:00:38,561 --> 03:00:40,921
TALIESIN: So I just took--

2693
03:00:40,921 --> 03:00:43,765
MATT: Nine points of damage total.

2694
03:00:43,765 --> 03:00:45,839
SAM: That's nothing! You're fine.

2695
03:00:45,839 --> 03:00:47,478
TALIESIN: That's a lot.

2696
03:00:47,478 --> 03:00:50,077
SAM: We each have like 150 hit points.

2697
03:00:50,077 --> 03:00:52,919
TRAVIS: The Hexblade's Curse is on any damage,
it's not melee.

2698
03:00:52,919 --> 03:00:54,551
MATT: Correct.

2699
03:00:54,551 --> 03:00:59,738
TRAVIS: I could roll an extra damage die, and it
would be for that crit. The 19.

2700
03:00:59,738 --> 03:01:02,041
MATT: Oh wait! Okay, good to know.

2701
03:01:02,041 --> 03:01:04,800
TRAVIS: It doesn't have to be melee. I had it
right there and I should've read it.

2702
03:01:04,800 --> 03:01:07,226
MATT: Thank you for clarifying. Go ahead and roll
another die.

2703
03:01:07,292 --> 03:01:12,603
TRAVIS: And it's a 1d10, not a 1d8. I was talking
out my ass before. So ten.

2704
03:01:12,603 --> 03:01:14,095
MATT: You rolled a ten?

2705
03:01:14,095 --> 03:01:15,270
TRAVIS: No, I rolled four.

2706
03:01:15,270 --> 03:01:16,600
MATT: Well, it's the additional die.

2707
03:01:16,600 --> 03:01:18,410
TRAVIS: Thank you, just the four.

2708
03:01:18,410 --> 03:01:23,459
MATT: So 19 damage on that one, nice. Good to know,
thank you. That brings us to the end of the imp's

2709
03:01:23,620 --> 03:01:25,630
turn. Molly, you're up.

2710
03:01:25,630 --> 03:01:36,194
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my bonus action, take a
slash at that imp. I can only use it as an action,

2711
03:01:36,194 --> 03:01:37,410
right?

2712
03:01:37,410 --> 03:01:40,952
MATT: Well, no. You have to attack with one hand
and then as a bonus you can attack with the

2713
03:01:40,952 --> 03:01:42,211
other.

2714
03:01:42,211 --> 03:01:47,604
TALIESIN: Okay, I'll burn my attack hitting that
bloody imp.

2715
03:01:47,604 --> 03:01:50,368
MATT: You can attack with the one that's not
enchanted if you wanted to.

2716
03:01:50,368 --> 03:01:52,046
TALIESIN: No, I'll hit it with the enchanted one.

2717
03:01:52,046 --> 03:01:53,601
MATT: Okay.

2718
03:01:53,601 --> 03:01:57,032
TALIESIN: I'm really hurt and I just took nine
points of damage.

2719
03:01:57,032 --> 03:01:58,018
MATT: Go for it.

2720
03:01:58,760 --> 03:02:00,777
TALIESIN: Yeah, 19 to hit.

2721
03:02:00,777 --> 03:02:03,025
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

2722
03:02:03,025 --> 03:02:05,541
TALIESIN: That's seven points of damage.

2723
03:02:05,541 --> 03:02:11,528
MATT: With a scream and a burst of flame and
sulfurous cloud, the imp flickers out of

2724
03:02:11,528 --> 03:02:12,877
existence.

2725
03:02:12,877 --> 03:02:18,887
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull back behind this tree
trunk then and get a little cover to figure out

2726
03:02:18,887 --> 03:02:21,524
what to do next, because I'm really hurt.

2727
03:02:21,524 --> 03:02:23,317
MATT: Okay, you used your action, you still have
your bonus action.

2728
03:02:23,317 --> 03:02:26,323
TALIESIN: Yeah. I can't heal or anything. My god,
I can't do anything.

2729
03:02:26,323 --> 03:02:33,735
MATT: You can still attack with your bonus action
if you wanted to. Okay, then back away. That's

2730
03:02:33,735 --> 03:02:46,457
your turn then. Molly's done. Kylre, let's see
here. He's going to make a standing leap.

2731
03:02:46,982 --> 03:02:49,614
LAURA: No-o-o-o!

2732
03:02:55,281 --> 03:02:57,311
(counting) 30, he can land right there.

2733
03:02:57,403 --> 03:02:58,589
SAM: Juggernaut.

2734
03:02:58,589 --> 03:03:01,998
MATT: Lands right next to you, Caleb, you get
knocked almost off your feet and barely hold

2735
03:03:01,998 --> 03:03:13,767
yourself there. As it lands, you glance over your
shoulder at it, its eyes burn ever bright and you

2736
03:03:13,767 --> 03:03:19,405
feel this horrible sickening sensation crawl
across your body, make a wisdom saving throw.

2737
03:03:19,405 --> 03:03:20,954
LAURA: Oh god.

2738
03:03:23,424 --> 03:03:24,227
LIAM: 20.

2739
03:03:24,937 --> 03:03:27,263
MATT: That succeeds the saving throw.

2740
03:03:27,263 --> 03:03:29,813
SAM: He's so wise!

2741
03:03:29,813 --> 03:03:36,724
MATT: You are not stunned, as the siphon life
deals four points of psychic damage to you.

2742
03:03:36,724 --> 03:03:40,004
LIAM: Okay. Plenty to spare.

2743
03:03:40,004 --> 03:03:43,090
However, he gains four temporary hit points.

2744
03:03:43,207 --> 03:03:44,308
TRAVIS: He gains four?

2745
03:03:44,308 --> 03:03:48,677
MATT: Yes. The life that it pulls from you
bolsters himself and it would've been a lot worse

2746
03:03:48,806 --> 03:03:54,514
if you had failed, so that's good. All right,
that's going to end Kylre's turn. Now going to

2747
03:03:54,514 --> 03:03:58,945
Toya, who's still singing, I need everybody to
make a wisdom saving throw, please.

2748
03:04:02,564 --> 03:04:04,242
TALIESIN: 16.

2749
03:04:04,242 --> 03:04:05,504
TRAVIS: 14.

2750
03:04:05,504 --> 03:04:06,593
LAURA: 21.

2751
03:04:06,593 --> 03:04:07,874
SAM: 19.

2752
03:04:07,874 --> 03:04:08,969
MARISHA: 20.

2753
03:04:08,969 --> 03:04:11,438
LIAM: What is this, wisdom? 23.

2754
03:04:11,438 --> 03:04:14,015
MATT: Yes. You guys are rolling some crazy fucking
saving throws!

2755
03:04:14,015 --> 03:04:15,825
MARISHA: Just saves.

2756
03:04:15,924 --> 03:04:20,582
MATT: Jesus. Well, Toya keeps singing. She's
starting to cry now, you can see tears running

2757
03:04:20,582 --> 03:04:29,777
down her face as you're pushing her into the wall.
That ends Toya's turn, Beau and Jester, you're up.

2758
03:04:31,569 --> 03:04:35,518
LAURA: Am I within hitting range--
me-me-me--

2759
03:04:35,625 --> 03:04:38,902
Can I run away without getting hit?

2760
03:04:38,902 --> 03:04:41,159
MATT: You don't know.

2761
03:04:41,159 --> 03:04:46,299
LAURA: Okay. Do you want to do something first?

2762
03:04:46,299 --> 03:04:50,325
MARISHA: Go for it, I'm just going to be like:
Shh, shut up! So go ahead.

2763
03:04:50,325 --> 03:04:57,136
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to, with my duplicity self,
get up on the roof.

2764
03:04:57,136 --> 03:05:00,040
MATT: All right.

2765
03:05:00,040 --> 03:05:06,893
LAURA: Right there. She's going to Guiding Bolt
straight in his face.

2766
03:05:06,893 --> 03:05:14,240
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll for the attack.
Guiding Bolt is a ranged spell attack, correct?

2767
03:05:14,240 --> 03:05:15,526
LAURA: Yes.

2768
03:05:16,842 --> 03:05:21,907
Balls! Seven.

2769
03:05:21,907 --> 03:05:29,382
MATT: Seven is not a hit. As you attempt to fire
the bolt outward, the devil creature glances up

2770
03:05:29,382 --> 03:05:34,619
and sees your secondary form and then ducks, as it
blasts into the ground right by your feet, arcing

2771
03:05:34,619 --> 03:05:42,145
past and exploding across the dirt and bits of--
whatever it is there. The word escaped me in the

2772
03:05:42,145 --> 03:05:43,298
moment.

2773
03:05:43,298 --> 03:05:44,695
SAM: Gore!

2774
03:05:44,695 --> 03:05:47,822
MATT: Yes. Well, no, I was going to say compost.
There you go, compost was the word I was looking

2775
03:05:47,822 --> 03:05:48,334
for.

2776
03:05:48,334 --> 03:05:50,370
LAURA: Skinky-doodie!

2777
03:05:50,642 --> 03:05:53,629
I am going to say: you are so stupid, why
did you get up on the roof like that?! That's why

2778
03:05:53,629 --> 03:05:59,387
he saw you! I am going to run to the tree,
straight back.

2779
03:05:59,691 --> 03:06:06,673
MATT: Okay. As you come out of the way, the toad's
long-armed reach swipes out at you as a reaction.

2780
03:06:11,238 --> 03:06:14,238
MARISHA: Jester has some self-deprecation issues?

2781
03:06:14,238 --> 03:06:16,302
That is going to be 16 to hit.

2782
03:06:16,477 --> 03:06:18,475
LAURA: It doesn't hit me. 17.

2783
03:06:18,475 --> 03:06:19,810
TRAVIS: You have AC 17?

2784
03:06:19,810 --> 03:06:21,672
LAURA: I got a shield, bitches.

2785
03:06:21,672 --> 03:06:25,257
MATT: As you run and dart, you see the giant arm
coming down towards you, and you pull the shield

2786
03:06:25,257 --> 03:06:30,306
up and it almost causes you to trip from the sheer
force of the impact. But the brunt of it is taken

2787
03:06:30,306 --> 03:06:34,865
by the shield as it scrapes off and you hear this
horrible grinding of metal as its claws scoop

2788
03:06:34,865 --> 03:06:39,112
across the outside of it. That ends your turn I
believe. Beau.

2789
03:06:39,112 --> 03:06:47,371
MARISHA: Okay, so I've got the little girl pinned,
and I am going to go, shh. I am going to take my

2790
03:06:47,371 --> 03:06:48,929
arm and--

2791
03:06:48,929 --> 03:06:50,564
MATT: Are you trying to cover her mouth?

2792
03:06:50,564 --> 03:06:52,410
MARISHA: Yep.

2793
03:06:52,410 --> 03:06:58,927
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an additional
athletics check.

2794
03:06:58,927 --> 03:07:01,643
MARISHA: I want to jam my whole forearm in her
mouth.

2795
03:07:01,643 --> 03:07:03,163
MATT: All right. Make an athletics check.

2796
03:07:03,163 --> 03:07:04,266
MARISHA: Okay.

2797
03:07:06,496 --> 03:07:08,012
LIAM: It's your forte, so--

2798
03:07:08,012 --> 03:07:09,760
MARISHA: Ten!

2799
03:07:12,165 --> 03:07:16,054
MATT: She rolled a ten as well. That is
considered--

2800
03:07:16,054 --> 03:07:19,391
MARISHA: A roll off! I get to roll again!

2801
03:07:19,391 --> 03:07:20,480
(laughter)

2802
03:07:20,480 --> 03:07:23,660
MATT: No, I believe for contesting...

2803
03:07:23,660 --> 03:07:26,496
TRAVIS: Yeah, because if it was AC, it would be
just enough. But--

2804
03:07:26,496 --> 03:07:30,394
MATT: Right. I'm looking at contesting grapple
checks here real fast.

2805
03:07:30,394 --> 03:07:31,996
TALIESIN: Ah, learning.

2806
03:07:35,886 --> 03:07:38,067
TRAVIS: (inaudible auctioneer voice)

2807
03:07:38,180 --> 03:07:40,950
(laughter)

2808
03:07:41,369 --> 03:07:43,581
LAURA: That was Fjord's other job.

2809
03:07:43,581 --> 03:07:45,148
TRAVIS: As a manure salesman.

2810
03:07:45,148 --> 03:07:46,805
(laughter)

2811
03:07:46,805 --> 03:07:51,122
MATT: Doesn't say as part of the rules. I'll say,
for the hell of it, let's roll it one more time.

2812
03:07:51,122 --> 03:07:52,642
MARISHA: Okay!

2813
03:07:52,642 --> 03:07:53,944
SAM: It's a roll off!

2814
03:07:53,944 --> 03:07:55,468
EVERYONE: Its a roll off!

2815
03:07:55,468 --> 03:07:56,897
MARISHA: Dance battle!

2816
03:07:56,897 --> 03:07:59,122
LIAM: Get back in there, Rocky!

2817
03:07:59,122 --> 03:08:05,520
MARISHA: Ah-- this one! Don't fuck me, blue! No,
that's good, plus, my athletics, right?

2818
03:08:05,520 --> 03:08:07,407
MATT: Yes.

2819
03:08:07,407 --> 03:08:09,249
MARISHA: 16, thank you.

2820
03:08:09,249 --> 03:08:16,389
MATT: Natural 18. This tiny little dwarf girl, her
stout form still manages to pull your arm back

2821
03:08:16,389 --> 03:08:22,148
from her mouth. The voice continues to
billow outward.

2822
03:08:22,148 --> 03:08:25,731
SAM: It's because she is really a tentacle. She is
part of him--

2823
03:08:25,839 --> 03:08:27,527
MARISHA: Do I have a bonus action?

2824
03:08:27,527 --> 03:08:30,896
MATT: Yeah, it was an attack, yeah. It was a
grapple attack. You do.

2825
03:08:30,896 --> 03:08:37,290
MARISHA: Can I try something else like that again,
or do I just get an attack?

2826
03:08:37,290 --> 03:08:40,947
MATT: I mean, what you want to do?

2827
03:08:40,947 --> 03:08:44,657
MARISHA: Okay, my arm doesn't work. I am going
to--

2828
03:08:44,657 --> 03:08:45,919
LAURA: Punch her in the face!

2829
03:08:45,919 --> 03:08:47,509
LIAM: Knock her the fuck out!

2830
03:08:47,509 --> 03:08:51,096
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to be like, fuck! I'm
going to elbow her right in the temple and try and

2831
03:08:51,096 --> 03:08:52,359
knock her out.

2832
03:08:52,359 --> 03:08:54,347
MATT: Okay, make an attack.

2833
03:08:57,366 --> 03:09:01,331
MARISHA: Natural 18. 24.

2834
03:09:01,331 --> 03:09:03,276
MATT: That hits, roll damage.

2835
03:09:03,276 --> 03:09:09,151
MARISHA: Right, 22, yes, 22. No, 24. I'm confused.
Okay.

2836
03:09:09,151 --> 03:09:11,095
TRAVIS: New characters.

2837
03:09:11,095 --> 03:09:13,940
MARISHA: New characters, new characters. 
New character, who dis?

2838
03:09:14,101 --> 03:09:16,280
Ah, yeah, okay, eight damage!

2839
03:09:16,280 --> 03:09:22,285
MATT: Eight damage. Whack! As you smack her in the
side of the head, her eyes loll back and she falls

2840
03:09:22,285 --> 03:09:24,732
limp in your grasp. She's unconscious.

2841
03:09:26,706 --> 03:09:28,132
TRAVIS: Wow.

2842
03:09:28,135 --> 03:09:30,500
MATT: The singing immediately stops.

2843
03:09:30,775 --> 03:09:33,246
LAURA: Oh, he is going to be so pissed!

2844
03:09:33,246 --> 03:09:36,115
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, tiny dancer coming.

2845
03:09:36,115 --> 03:09:38,401
MARISHA: That's all. That ends my turn right? I'm
holding this girl?

2846
03:09:38,401 --> 03:09:40,053
MATT: You have your movement. You are holding her
there.

2847
03:09:40,053 --> 03:09:47,688
MARISHA: Oh, I'm holding her? Can I drag her back
a bit? Into the woods.

2848
03:09:47,688 --> 03:09:51,086
MATT: Okay, it's half movement to drag her. That's
as far as you can get.

2849
03:09:51,086 --> 03:09:55,937
MARISHA: I'm going to be quiet. Can I support her
head?

2850
03:09:56,021 --> 03:10:02,773
MATT: As soon as the singing stops. (grunts) The
toad looks over the shoulder and sees you dragging

2851
03:10:02,773 --> 03:10:15,669
her back. What previously was this low, guttural
growl becomes this bellowing scream of hatred.

2852
03:10:15,669 --> 03:10:17,231
That ends your turn, Beau.

2853
03:10:17,231 --> 03:10:20,706
LAURA: What are the odds you think that Yasha's on
this island and she's going to come save us all?

2854
03:10:20,706 --> 03:10:21,831
MATT: Caleb, your turn.

2855
03:10:21,831 --> 03:10:25,413
LIAM: As soon as it starts roaring, I am
surrounded, I have nowhere to go so I pull the

2856
03:10:25,413 --> 03:10:31,149
diamond out, spin it, and the ice shards start to
shoot and I pick it up and I throw it in his

2857
03:10:31,149 --> 03:10:32,672
bellybutton.

2858
03:10:32,672 --> 03:10:38,206
MATT: All right. You are in melee range with a
creature doing a ranged spell attack, so go ahead

2859
03:10:38,206 --> 03:10:39,795
and roll your attack. It has disadvantage.

2860
03:10:39,795 --> 03:10:48,430
LIAM: That's okay because if I move I am dicked.
That's not good. That's terrible. The second one

2861
03:10:48,430 --> 03:10:53,436
was so good though. That's not great. That's ten.

2862
03:10:53,436 --> 03:10:58,291
MATT: Unfortunately, as you're scared, the sound
of its screaming causes you to shake as you

2863
03:10:58,291 --> 03:11:04,806
release the blast. Unfortunately, your fingers
lose the hold of your diamond for a moment and you

2864
03:11:04,806 --> 03:11:11,488
have to actually catch it. As you do, the spell
dissipates and fumbles. Anything else on your

2865
03:11:11,488 --> 03:11:13,044
turn, Caleb?

2866
03:11:13,044 --> 03:11:28,947
LIAM: I'm going to-- Nope. I'm going to stay there
and freeze. Freeze up. The cat's a bird and she

2867
03:11:28,947 --> 03:11:31,331
flies up straight.

2868
03:11:31,331 --> 03:11:34,949
MATT: That ends Caleb's turn. Nott, you're up.

2869
03:11:34,949 --> 03:11:39,911
TRAVIS: Warhorn.

2870
03:11:39,911 --> 03:11:42,742
LAURA: Do something cool.

2871
03:11:42,742 --> 03:11:54,764
SAM: I mean I can-- seeing Caleb surrounded, Nott
will leap on to the beast's face and stab it in

2872
03:11:54,764 --> 03:11:57,222
the neck.

2873
03:11:57,222 --> 03:11:58,524
MATT: Which one, the toad?

2874
03:11:58,524 --> 03:11:59,571
SAM: The big one.

2875
03:11:59,571 --> 03:12:02,990
MATT: You will get an attack--

2876
03:12:02,990 --> 03:12:04,696
SAM: I'll disengage first.

2877
03:12:04,696 --> 03:12:07,298
MATT Okay, so you disengage as a bonus action.
Move over--

2878
03:12:07,298 --> 03:12:09,117
LAURA: You knocked me off the roof.

2879
03:12:09,117 --> 03:12:10,602
MATT: I'm sorry.

2880
03:12:10,602 --> 03:12:15,936
LAURA: She didn't feel anything. She doesn't have
actual nerves.

2881
03:12:15,936 --> 03:12:22,961
MATT: Exactly. As you push away from the imp as it
tries to strike at you, seeing your friend in

2882
03:12:22,961 --> 03:12:27,460
serious danger here, you dive into the shadows,
leap into the air. Go ahead and roll an attack.

2883
03:12:27,460 --> 03:12:29,492
SAM: 19.

2884
03:12:29,492 --> 03:12:35,005
MATT: 19 hits. Go ahead and roll damage plus sneak
attack, because Caleb is in range.

2885
03:12:35,005 --> 03:12:39,826
SAM: Nine, ten, plus fury of the small, 12.

2886
03:12:39,826 --> 03:12:47,540
MATT: All right. So 12 points of damage. As you
drive the blade into the devil toad, you see it

2887
03:12:47,540 --> 03:12:53,327
plunge right to the hilt and it begins to bleed
from the wound but its attention is still focused

2888
03:12:53,327 --> 03:13:00,936
on the unconscious dwarf being dragged off by the
monk. But that was a pretty sizeable blow. That

2889
03:13:00,936 --> 03:13:03,141
ends your turn I believe. Fjord.

2890
03:13:03,141 --> 03:13:08,644
TRAVIS: All right, I have a question. Hexblade's
Curse. If I do another bonus action, does

2891
03:13:08,644 --> 03:13:14,438
Hexblade's Curse keep going? It doesn't say-- it
says if the curse ends early or the target dies

2892
03:13:14,438 --> 03:13:18,133
or you die or you're incapacitated, it drops but
nothing else.

2893
03:13:18,133 --> 03:13:19,339
MATT: Does it say it's concentration?

2894
03:13:19,339 --> 03:13:20,506
TRAVIS: It doesn't say.

2895
03:13:20,506 --> 03:13:21,832
MATT: Then I would say it's not concentration

2896
03:13:21,832 --> 03:13:26,008
TRAVIS: Fucking A. With my bonus action, can I
cast Wrathful Smite?

2897
03:13:26,008 --> 03:13:27,596
MATT: Yes you may.

2898
03:13:27,596 --> 03:13:33,876
TRAVIS: May I charge el toad from hell-o?

2899
03:13:33,876 --> 03:13:39,680
MATT: That you can. As you run through the space
between that large rock and the exterior of the

2900
03:13:39,680 --> 03:13:48,103
ruined building, your large blade, water drifts
off of it behind. It seems to almost perpetually

2901
03:13:48,103 --> 03:13:52,926
emanate its own source of water. You arc with the
blade forward. Go ahead and make your strike.

2902
03:13:52,926 --> 03:13:58,276
TRAVIS: 17 to hit.

2903
03:13:58,276 --> 03:13:59,483
MATT: That hits.

2904
03:13:59,483 --> 03:14:02,589
TRAVIS: Beautiful. This is a 1d8.

2905
03:14:02,589 --> 03:14:05,792
MATT: Is it one-handed, or are you holding it with
two hands?

2906
03:14:05,792 --> 03:14:07,109
TRAVIS: I didn't really say.

2907
03:14:07,109 --> 03:14:08,188
MATT: You did not.

2908
03:14:08,188 --> 03:14:16,538
TRAVIS: So I'll go with the lower of the two. 1d8
plus four. 12 plus a 1d6 psychic damage and he has

2909
03:14:16,538 --> 03:14:17,460
to make--

2910
03:14:17,460 --> 03:14:18,830
MATT: Was it plus four, right?

2911
03:14:18,830 --> 03:14:20,287
TRAVIS: It is plus four.

2912
03:14:20,287 --> 03:14:24,882
MATT: Your charisma's plus four. Then you get a
plus two because of your Hex, so technically it's

2913
03:14:24,882 --> 03:14:30,642
16. Sorry, 14.

2914
03:14:30,642 --> 03:14:38,531
TRAVIS: Let's see, 1d6 psychic damage, which is an
additional one for 15. He makes a wisdom saving

2915
03:14:38,531 --> 03:14:40,630
throw or he's frightened until the end of the
spell.

2916
03:14:40,630 --> 03:14:44,058
MATT: That is going to be a 12. What's the DC?

2917
03:14:44,058 --> 03:14:50,621
TRAVIS: Oh, I think that's lower than my 14. I've
got a spell save DC, y'all!

2918
03:14:50,621 --> 03:15:00,048
MATT: As you rush through the air and the blade
arcs, the water seems to glow as it comes off,

2919
03:15:00,048 --> 03:15:07,226
like it becomes phosphorescent and as he impacts
the blade into the side of the demon toad, there's

2920
03:15:07,226 --> 03:15:12,128
a flash of light and what's left behind is the
scar that you've cut through its body is now

2921
03:15:12,128 --> 03:15:19,671
burning with this reminiscent ember where you just
carved through its hide. It looks down at you,

2922
03:15:19,671 --> 03:15:25,296
averts its gaze from the monk for a second, and
goes (confused snarling). For a split second, for

2923
03:15:25,296 --> 03:15:28,306
the first time, you see fear in its red burning
eyes.

2924
03:15:28,306 --> 03:15:29,518
TRAVIS: Yes!

2925
03:15:29,518 --> 03:15:30,979
MATT: How long does that last?

2926
03:15:30,979 --> 03:15:37,228
TRAVIS: It lasts until he can make a wisdom check
against the spell save DC.

2927
03:15:37,228 --> 03:15:42,714
MATT: Again? Okay. So he has disadvantage on
attacks and cannot move closer towards you.

2928
03:15:42,714 --> 03:15:43,896
MARISHA: Amazing.

2929
03:15:43,896 --> 03:15:45,582
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's frightened.

2930
03:15:45,582 --> 03:15:59,146
MATT: That ends Fjord's turn. The imps are up now.
This imp here is going to turn around and dart

2931
03:15:59,146 --> 03:16:07,483
towards the cleric who ran off to the side and
that one's going to attack Caleb. Caleb, that is

2932
03:16:07,483 --> 03:16:10,381
going to be a 12 to hit?

2933
03:16:10,381 --> 03:16:11,491
LIAM: Deffo.

2934
03:16:11,491 --> 03:16:12,421
MATT: That hits?

2935
03:16:12,421 --> 03:16:13,402
LIAM: Yeah.

2936
03:16:13,402 --> 03:16:19,693
MATT: Okay. So you suffer, as the stinger hits
you, for seven points of piercing damage. I need

2937
03:16:19,693 --> 03:16:22,088
you to make a constitution saving throw, please.

2938
03:16:22,088 --> 03:16:24,091
SAM: No problem.

2939
03:16:24,091 --> 03:16:26,835
LIAM: That's a 12.

2940
03:16:26,835 --> 03:16:33,932
MATT: A 12 succeeds. So you only suffer five
points of poison damage.

2941
03:16:33,932 --> 03:16:35,937
LIAM: Caleb is unconscious on the ground.

2942
03:16:35,937 --> 03:16:39,201
LAURA: Oh no!

2943
03:16:39,201 --> 03:16:48,970
MATT: The other imp attacking you, Jester. That is
going to be a natural 19. Pretty sure that hits

2944
03:16:48,970 --> 03:16:57,675
you at 24. You take six points of piercing damage
and I need you to make a constitution saving throw.

2945
03:16:57,675 --> 03:17:00,161
TALIESIN: Jesus, these things are so vicious.

2946
03:17:00,161 --> 03:17:02,134
SAM: And you lose all your gold.

2947
03:17:02,134 --> 03:17:06,938
LAURA: God (angry muttering)-- seven.

2948
03:17:06,938 --> 03:17:10,879
LIAM: Jeez, this is going south guys.

2949
03:17:10,879 --> 03:17:13,574
MATT: Actually, that's not too bad. Six points of
poison damage.

2950
03:17:13,574 --> 03:17:15,086
LAURA: So 12 total?

2951
03:17:15,086 --> 03:17:16,154
MATT: Correct.

2952
03:17:16,154 --> 03:17:17,774
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

2953
03:17:17,774 --> 03:17:22,124
MATT: All right, that's going to end the imps'
turn. Molly, you're up.

2954
03:17:22,124 --> 03:17:29,267
TALIESIN: (groaning) Shit.

2955
03:17:29,267 --> 03:17:33,806
LIAM and SAM: Get her done.

2956
03:17:33,806 --> 03:17:44,908
TALIESIN: I'm going to get a little closer, I'm
going to start running towards the ruins.

2957
03:17:44,908 --> 03:17:47,452
MATT: That's 30 feet there.

2958
03:17:47,452 --> 03:17:58,631
TALIESIN: That'll do it. I'm going to look at the
imp and I'm, in Infernal, I'm going to say, to

2959
03:17:58,631 --> 03:18:10,088
just-- terrible: There's nothing but death for you
here. I'm going to attack Vicious Mockery on him

2960
03:18:10,088 --> 03:18:12,869
and show him the bottom card.

2961
03:18:12,869 --> 03:18:15,025
SAM: Are you a bard?! What the fuck?

2962
03:18:15,025 --> 03:18:17,663
MATT: Variant tiefling.

2963
03:18:17,663 --> 03:18:21,168
TALIESIN: I have to learn some-- Yeah, that's a--

2964
03:18:21,168 --> 03:18:23,513
MATT: A wisdom saving throw?

2965
03:18:23,513 --> 03:18:26,335
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's a wisdom saving throw.

2966
03:18:26,335 --> 03:18:29,219
MATT: That is going to be a no with a seven, I'm
pretty sure.

2967
03:18:29,219 --> 03:18:31,515
TALIESIN: I'm trying to figure out how this works
but--

2968
03:18:31,515 --> 03:18:35,371
LIAM: By the way, when Caleb went down those four
balls of light disappeared.

2969
03:18:35,371 --> 03:18:36,919
MARISHA: No!

2970
03:18:36,919 --> 03:18:44,867
TALIESIN: It's not a lot, but that's four points
of psychic damage and he has disadvantage on the

2971
03:18:44,867 --> 03:18:46,692
next attack roll it makes.

2972
03:18:46,692 --> 03:18:48,306
MATT: All righty, good to know.

2973
03:18:48,306 --> 03:18:57,093
TALIESIN: That was just my bonus action, I'm going
to use my action--

2974
03:18:57,093 --> 03:18:59,192
MATT: Vicious Mockery is an action.

2975
03:18:59,192 --> 03:19:08,561
TALIESIN: No that's a-- it is an action, you're
right. That's what I've got right now. Just trying

2976
03:19:08,561 --> 03:19:10,114
to get its attention.

2977
03:19:10,114 --> 03:19:24,298
MATT: Okay. That ends your turn. It is now Kylre's
turn who is-- (laughs) oh man, yeah. He was about

2978
03:19:24,298 --> 03:19:29,658
to go right after Beau, but he's scared of you and
cannot move closer towards you. He's going to take

2979
03:19:29,658 --> 03:19:36,969
a swing at Nott. He's like (panicked muttering)
and try to squash the small thing right there,

2980
03:19:36,969 --> 03:19:42,952
with disadvantage. That is 16.

2981
03:19:42,952 --> 03:19:44,346
SAM: 16.

2982
03:19:44,346 --> 03:19:59,090
MATT: 16's your armor class? That hits. 11 points
of piercing damage as the claw strikes out at you,

2983
03:19:59,090 --> 03:20:03,011
and I need you to make a constitution saving
throw.

2984
03:20:03,011 --> 03:20:06,423
TALIESIN: Oh my god. We're not doing well.

2985
03:20:06,423 --> 03:20:08,195
SAM: Ten.

2986
03:20:08,195 --> 03:20:15,553
MATT: Ten is just what you needed to succeed. The
poison from the claws of the toad does not set

2987
03:20:15,553 --> 03:20:17,136
into your system.

2988
03:20:17,136 --> 03:20:19,296
TRAVIS: I can't believe this shit.

2989
03:20:19,296 --> 03:20:21,653
MARISHA: I know. Who's down? You're down?

2990
03:20:21,653 --> 03:20:24,500
TALIESIN: He's the only one who's down but we're
all hurt.

2991
03:20:24,500 --> 03:20:27,979
LAURA: And I've got a thing right in front of me
so I can't--

2992
03:20:27,979 --> 03:20:36,049
MATT: Kylre's going to-- out of sheer panic now
from you-- try to flee. So he's going to leap and

2993
03:20:36,049 --> 03:20:43,055
land over here. You do both get attacks of
opportunity on the toad. Would not have fled

2994
03:20:43,055 --> 03:20:45,441
except for that fear effect. He's like, "Fuck, I
got to run."

2995
03:20:45,441 --> 03:20:46,899
SAM: 22.

2996
03:20:46,899 --> 03:20:48,010
MATT: That hits.

2997
03:20:48,010 --> 03:20:49,116
TRAVIS: 18.

2998
03:20:49,116 --> 03:20:50,341
MATT: Hits.

2999
03:20:50,341 --> 03:20:52,181
TRAVIS: Can I grab the sword with two hands,
please?

3000
03:20:52,181 --> 03:20:53,389
MATT: Sure.

3001
03:20:53,389 --> 03:20:55,318
SAM: Eight points.

3002
03:20:55,318 --> 03:20:58,760
MATT: Eight points of damage. You added sneak
attack to that, right?

3003
03:20:58,760 --> 03:21:00,578
SAM: Why do I get sneak attack?

3004
03:21:00,578 --> 03:21:01,949
MATT: Because he is next to it.

3005
03:21:01,949 --> 03:21:04,705
SAM: All right. 11 points.

3006
03:21:04,705 --> 03:21:06,465
MATT: 11 points of damage. Nice.

3007
03:21:06,465 --> 03:21:10,026
TRAVIS: 11 points of damage, and does that trigger
another psychic attack?

3008
03:21:10,026 --> 03:21:15,317
MATT: How does the effect on that work?

3009
03:21:15,317 --> 03:21:18,878
TRAVIS: It says the next time you hit with a
melee weapon attack during the spell's duration

3010
03:21:18,878 --> 03:21:20,455
your attack deals an extra 1d6.

3011
03:21:20,455 --> 03:21:21,662
MATT: Yes, it does.

3012
03:21:21,662 --> 03:21:24,845
TRAVIS: Okay. So that's 11 plus five, so 16?

3013
03:21:24,845 --> 03:21:29,621
MATT: 16 points of damage. All righty.

3014
03:21:29,621 --> 03:21:32,770
TRAVIS: Concentration. Can't use something else.
Committed.

3015
03:21:32,770 --> 03:21:37,455
MARISHA: It's a bitch, isn't it? Concentration's a
bitch.

3016
03:21:37,455 --> 03:21:45,363
MATT: As an action it has to try and save against
the spell, ending the effect. Damn, that's crazy.

3017
03:21:45,363 --> 03:21:54,035
All righty, so that being the case, that's going
to end Kylre's turn. Lands, looks over at you

3018
03:21:54,035 --> 03:21:55,500
hiding behind the tree--

3019
03:21:55,500 --> 03:21:57,838
TALIESIN: Oh god, no.

3020
03:21:57,838 --> 03:22:09,266
MATT: Toya, death saving throw. That's a success.
All righty, that brings us to Beau and Jester.

3021
03:22:09,266 --> 03:22:14,517
What are you guys doing, Beau and Jester?

3022
03:22:14,517 --> 03:22:16,499
LAURA: You can go first this time.

3023
03:22:16,499 --> 03:22:23,321
MARISHA: I can go first? Who am I next to? Who's
Beau next to?

3024
03:22:23,321 --> 03:22:25,148
MATT: You're right here, next to Toya.

3025
03:22:25,148 --> 03:22:39,126
MARISHA: And Fjord is in between... I'm too far
away from everything.

3026
03:22:39,126 --> 03:22:40,525
MATT: Yeah.

3027
03:22:40,525 --> 03:22:51,740
MARISHA: Can I run-- I want to pick her up--

3028
03:22:51,740 --> 03:22:55,210
MATT: It's half movement with her if you bring
her.

3029
03:22:55,210 --> 03:23:01,022
MARISHA: That's fair. No, I'm sorry. I want to
move this way towards Molly.

3030
03:23:01,022 --> 03:23:04,145
MATT: Okay. Double move?

3031
03:23:04,145 --> 03:23:10,368
MARISHA: Yeah, and I'll try and get behind-- I've
got a 40-foot movement.

3032
03:23:10,368 --> 03:23:12,998
MATT: That's right. So you can get there.

3033
03:23:12,998 --> 03:23:19,322
MARISHA: Okay. Do I have any type of bonus action
or anything?

3034
03:23:19,322 --> 03:23:21,112
MATT: You have your bonus action.

3035
03:23:21,112 --> 03:23:31,613
MARISHA: Can I yell, Kylre! And I want to hold
up the girl and be like, come get her!

3036
03:23:31,613 --> 03:23:34,259
(laughter)

3037
03:23:34,259 --> 03:23:36,006
TALIESIN: Fuck, man.

3038
03:23:36,006 --> 03:23:43,038
MATT: Kylre, between the trees and being
frightened of Fjord, doesn't seem to notice you at

3039
03:23:43,038 --> 03:23:45,596
the moment. He's currently focused on the fear
effect.

3040
03:23:45,596 --> 03:23:46,933
MARISHA: Yeah, I tried.

3041
03:23:46,933 --> 03:23:50,915
MATT: That's all good. That ends your turn.
Jester?

3042
03:23:50,915 --> 03:23:56,685
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to cast-- fuck-- Cure
Wounds on myself.

3043
03:23:56,685 --> 03:23:57,951
MATT: Okay.

3044
03:23:57,951 --> 03:24:01,518
TALIESIN: Glad you didn't do Detect Evil?

3045
03:24:01,518 --> 03:24:10,709
LAURA: Yeah. Oh, that's good! Nine points of
damage healed. Okay. Which is going to go away as

3046
03:24:10,709 --> 03:24:17,901
soon as I turn and run away from the imp towards
Fjord, around the trees so that the frog guy

3047
03:24:17,901 --> 03:24:19,465
doesn't get an attack on me.

3048
03:24:19,465 --> 03:24:23,985
MATT: Well, you're still in his combat range,
actually. He has a ten-foot range.

3049
03:24:23,985 --> 03:24:27,853
LIAM: Stay. Maybe he'll be distracted by fear.

3050
03:24:27,853 --> 03:24:33,360
MATT: He does have disadvantage on the attacks
because of the fear effect, so that's helpful. Do

3051
03:24:33,360 --> 03:24:34,929
you want to run through this way?

3052
03:24:34,929 --> 03:24:35,981
LAURA: I guess, yeah.

3053
03:24:35,981 --> 03:24:37,777
TALIESIN: He can't follow you.

3054
03:24:37,777 --> 03:24:41,665
MATT: 30, that puts you there. Both the imp and
Kylre get an--

3055
03:24:41,665 --> 03:24:43,246
TALIESIN: Both have disadvantage.

3056
03:24:43,246 --> 03:24:45,062
MATT: The imp because...

3057
03:24:45,062 --> 03:24:47,380
TALIESIN: Vicious Mockery.

3058
03:24:47,380 --> 03:24:48,655
MATT: Oh, that's right, yeah. That's right.

3059
03:24:48,655 --> 03:24:54,486
TALIESIN: Part of the plan!

3060
03:24:54,486 --> 03:24:56,935
LIAM: Damn. We're in a tight spot.

3061
03:24:56,935 --> 03:25:05,032
MATT: That Vicious Mockery brings the imp's attack
down to a nine, so the stinger whips past you.

3062
03:25:05,032 --> 03:25:13,144
Kylre's giant claw reaches out and tries to catch
you as you run past. Natural 20 and a three.

3063
03:25:13,144 --> 03:25:18,825
(relieved noises)

3064
03:25:18,825 --> 03:25:25,015
MATT: That puts you at a nine, which I'm pretty
sure misses. As you rush past, you hear the (boom)

3065
03:25:25,015 --> 03:25:29,214
of the ground behind you and bits of dirt and rock
throw up, tapping the back of your head from the

3066
03:25:29,214 --> 03:25:31,429
impact of Kylre's grasp hitting the ground.

3067
03:25:31,429 --> 03:25:33,274
LAURA: I'm just running away saying: Shit, shit,
shit!

3068
03:25:33,274 --> 03:25:35,653
MATT: That ends your turn?

3069
03:25:35,653 --> 03:25:36,968
LAURA: I guess so.

3070
03:25:36,968 --> 03:25:41,341
MATT: That brings us to Caleb. I need you to make
a death saving throw.

3071
03:25:41,341 --> 03:25:43,638
LIAM: Success.

3072
03:25:43,638 --> 03:25:46,276
MATT: Okay, that's one success in that. Nott.

3073
03:25:46,276 --> 03:25:50,380
SAM: There is an imp still in front of us?

3074
03:25:50,380 --> 03:25:52,956
MATT: Yes. There is an imp that just knocked Caleb
to the ground.

3075
03:25:52,956 --> 03:25:54,519
LIAM: He's going to fuck me up.

3076
03:25:54,519 --> 03:26:00,046
SAM: Okay. I will just shoot him with an arrow.
I'm like ten feet away?

3077
03:26:00,046 --> 03:26:02,352
MATT: Yeah. 15 feet from him.

3078
03:26:02,352 --> 03:26:04,435
SAM: 15 feet. I'll draw and shoot.

3079
03:26:04,435 --> 03:26:06,619
MATT: You pull out your hand crossbow.

3080
03:26:06,619 --> 03:26:09,444
SAM: Oh boy, ten.

3081
03:26:09,444 --> 03:26:15,046
MATT: Ten? That does not hit, unfortunately. It
ducks out of the way.

3082
03:26:15,046 --> 03:26:17,474
SAM: And then I will--

3083
03:26:17,474 --> 03:26:21,185
TALIESIN: You have so few actions.

3084
03:26:21,185 --> 03:26:27,705
SAM: I really do. I will cover Caleb's body with
mine.

3085
03:26:27,705 --> 03:26:29,665
TALIESIN: Does that work?

3086
03:26:29,665 --> 03:26:31,025
SAM: We'll see.

3087
03:26:31,025 --> 03:26:36,299
MATT: You move onto Caleb's space and use your
body as a shield. Okay, that ends Nott's turn.

3088
03:26:36,299 --> 03:26:37,644
Fjord, you're up.

3089
03:26:37,644 --> 03:26:43,418
TRAVIS: Let's try to finish this motherfucker off.
I run right past Jester as she's going, "Shit, shit!"

3090
03:26:43,418 --> 03:26:47,336
MATT: 30 is as close as you can get right there.

3091
03:26:47,336 --> 03:26:53,540
TRAVIS: Which is not in melee. Damn! Eldritch
Blast!

3092
03:26:53,540 --> 03:26:58,925
MATT: You are in its melee range, which means
you'll have disadvantage on Eldritch Blast.

3093
03:26:58,925 --> 03:27:02,165
Knowing that, you can take a step back.

3094
03:27:02,165 --> 03:27:03,715
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll take one back.

3095
03:27:03,715 --> 03:27:07,772
LIAM: Travis wouldn't, but Fjord would know.

3096
03:27:07,772 --> 03:27:10,310
TRAVIS: That is a 24.

3097
03:27:10,310 --> 03:27:15,280
MATT: That definitely hits. Is it a natural 18?

3098
03:27:15,280 --> 03:27:29,840
TRAVIS: It's a 17. Plus six, 23. Sorry. That is
eight plus four plus two. 12, 14, and the--

3099
03:27:29,840 --> 03:27:32,833
MATT: Don't do additional psychic damage, it has
to be a melee weapon to do that.

3100
03:27:32,833 --> 03:27:34,844
TRAVIS: Thank you. 14.

3101
03:27:34,844 --> 03:27:41,590
MATT: 14 points of damage. All righty. Fjord, how
do you want to do this?

3102
03:27:41,590 --> 03:27:45,036
(cheering)

3103
03:27:45,036 --> 03:27:53,523
TRAVIS: Oh shit! I run up. Stop. Realize how long
its arms are. Flip the sword over. Look into the

3104
03:27:53,523 --> 03:27:56,759
pommel, and fire it into his back, line him up.

3105
03:27:56,759 --> 03:28:04,031
MATT: As the creature pulls its jammed hand out of
the ground after trying to strike at Jester, it

3106
03:28:04,031 --> 03:28:09,024
turns around to watch as you approach, and as you
hold the pommel outward, the blast, lighting up its

3107
03:28:09,024 --> 03:28:15,903
jaw, its eyes go to a bright pink with fear as it
recoils from the blast. As it hits, the blast

3108
03:28:15,903 --> 03:28:24,359
seems to be absorbed by its blubberous form. This
crack begins to (cracking) across its body. It's

3109
03:28:24,359 --> 03:28:30,077
trying to hold itself together, and the scales
begin to turn to ash. Like the inside of it

3110
03:28:30,077 --> 03:28:34,078
burning out like the end of a cigarette, the
embers glowing, incinerating the interior of its

3111
03:28:34,078 --> 03:28:40,356
body as it slowly tries to hold its body together.
It falls to its knees and then slowly the rest of

3112
03:28:40,356 --> 03:28:42,775
its body tumbles away into ash and dust.

3113
03:28:42,775 --> 03:28:46,373
TALIESIN: There is no body?

3114
03:28:46,373 --> 03:28:51,514
MATT: The whole body doesn't burn away.

3115
03:28:51,514 --> 03:28:54,740
TALIESIN: We need a body!

3116
03:28:54,740 --> 03:28:57,973
MATT: The wound where it impacted is burned up at
this point.

3117
03:28:57,973 --> 03:29:02,730
TALIESIN: Oh thank god. Is that imp still there?
Is the imp still active?

3118
03:29:02,730 --> 03:29:07,217
MATT: Two imps are still active, yes. That ends
your turn, Fjord?

3119
03:29:07,217 --> 03:29:08,181
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3120
03:29:08,181 --> 03:29:17,310
MATT: That imp is going to go after Nott, who is
currently protecting the body.

3121
03:29:17,310 --> 03:29:21,328
TALIESIN: I'm going to Blood Maledict. I'm going
to Curse of the Eyeless on that imp.

3122
03:29:21,328 --> 03:29:24,477
MATT: Which one, the one that is attacking Nott?

3123
03:29:24,477 --> 03:29:26,141
TALIESIN: The one that is attacking Nott.

3124
03:29:26,141 --> 03:29:32,957
MATT: Okay, so disadvantage on that one. That puts
it at 14.

3125
03:29:32,957 --> 03:29:34,274
SAM: 16.

3126
03:29:34,274 --> 03:29:40,806
MATT: As its eyes cloud over, it swings with its
stinger and you feel it just barely hit the tip of

3127
03:29:40,806 --> 03:29:47,809
your hood and pull it back. But no impact from the
stinger. One will attack you, Fjord. That is an 18.

3128
03:29:47,809 --> 03:29:49,047
TRAVIS: That will hit.

3129
03:29:49,047 --> 03:29:50,596
MATT: Yeah, it hits.

3130
03:29:50,596 --> 03:29:51,970
TRAVIS: You motherfucker.

3131
03:29:51,970 --> 03:30:00,153
MATT: You suffer seven points of piercing damage,
and I need you to roll a constitution saving throw.

3132
03:30:00,153 --> 03:30:02,071
TRAVIS: Copy that.

3133
03:30:02,071 --> 03:30:04,722
MARISHA: Big money! That's not big money!

3134
03:30:04,722 --> 03:30:10,704
TRAVIS: That is not big money. I'm pretty sure
that is low, because that is a two. Yeah, that's a six.

3135
03:30:10,704 --> 03:30:18,110
MATT: 3d6 of poison damage, that is 14 points of
poison damage.

3136
03:30:18,110 --> 03:30:20,809
LAURA: Are you still alive?

3137
03:30:20,809 --> 03:30:23,744
TRAVIS: No, I'm unconscious.

3138
03:30:23,744 --> 03:30:26,021
TALIESIN: Oh for fuck's sake.

3139
03:30:26,021 --> 03:30:27,701
SAM: From an imp?

3140
03:30:27,701 --> 03:30:30,665
MATT: That stinger is no joke, man.

3141
03:30:30,665 --> 03:30:34,971
LAURA: Wouldn't that be funny if we killed the
thing and then died from the imps? That would be

3142
03:30:34,971 --> 03:30:36,342
so funny.

3143
03:30:36,342 --> 03:30:43,337
MATT: After the creature that summoned it is gone,
the imp turns and as it runs toward you, you try

3144
03:30:43,337 --> 03:30:46,809
and prepare, and its stinger pushes past your
leather armor and pierces right through your

3145
03:30:46,809 --> 03:30:52,691
sternum and poison hits the inside of your system,
right where the heart and lungs are and you feel

3146
03:30:52,691 --> 03:31:00,584
them seize up. Your eyes and sight go to darkness.
That ends both imps' goes. Molly, you are up.

3147
03:31:00,584 --> 03:31:05,248
TALIESIN: I'm running at the closest imp. Can I
get there?

3148
03:31:05,248 --> 03:31:06,587
MATT: You can get there.

3149
03:31:06,587 --> 03:31:08,097
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to take two
swings.

3150
03:31:08,097 --> 03:31:09,856
MATT: Go for it.

3151
03:31:09,856 --> 03:31:20,950
TALIESIN: For fuck's sake. Nope. That was a ten.

3152
03:31:20,950 --> 03:31:29,718
MATT: No. You try and swing, the blind rage in
your eyes, but the imp whose eyesight you had

3153
03:31:29,718 --> 03:31:37,009
cursed, hearing you approaching, manages to just
get out of your range. Sorry man, that sucks. All

3154
03:31:37,009 --> 03:31:40,600
right, that brings us to Beau and Jester's turn.

3155
03:31:40,600 --> 03:31:52,273
LAURA: I'm going to turn and say: Oh, help me,
Traveler! I'm going to cast Word of Radiance.

3156
03:31:52,273 --> 03:31:56,592
SAM: It's pronounced "verd."

3157
03:31:56,592 --> 03:32:02,776
LAURA: Which will hit both of the imps with 1d6
radiant damage.

3158
03:32:02,776 --> 03:32:05,308
MATT: What is the spell?

3159
03:32:05,308 --> 03:32:17,286
LAURA: It's Word of Radiance. Each creature of my
choice I can see must succeed on a constitution

3160
03:32:17,286 --> 03:32:18,445
saving throw.

3161
03:32:18,445 --> 03:32:20,227
MATT: Constitution saving throw? Thank you.

3162
03:32:20,227 --> 03:32:21,667
LAURA: Of 13.

3163
03:32:21,667 --> 03:32:30,199
MATT: Five and 16. The one over Fjord succeeds,
the one over Nott does not. What does it do?

3164
03:32:30,199 --> 03:32:33,122
LAURA: 1d6 radiant. Six damage!

3165
03:32:33,122 --> 03:32:35,898
MATT: Six points of damage to the one over Nott?

3166
03:32:35,898 --> 03:32:36,824
LAURA: Yeah.

3167
03:32:36,824 --> 03:32:39,569
MATT: That's the one that someone damaged.

3168
03:32:39,569 --> 03:32:41,180
LAURA: Yeah, that's the one he cursed.

3169
03:32:41,180 --> 03:32:49,597
MATT: Yeah, with Vicious Mockery. That's enough to
do it. This bright, whitish-blue light begins to

3170
03:32:49,597 --> 03:32:55,123
burn up its body. As it tries to fly away, you
watch its body burn away like flash paper.

3171
03:32:55,123 --> 03:32:58,861
MARISHA and TRAVIS: That is cool.

3172
03:32:58,861 --> 03:33:01,981
TALIESIN: Can you bonus action anybody?

3173
03:33:01,981 --> 03:33:05,087
LAURA: That was an action.

3174
03:33:05,087 --> 03:33:06,636
TALIESIN: Stabilize someone?

3175
03:33:06,636 --> 03:33:09,063
MATT: No, that's a feat.

3176
03:33:09,063 --> 03:33:16,082
LAURA: As a bonus can I-- I don't even have
a healing potion.

3177
03:33:16,082 --> 03:33:17,690
TRAVIS: There is one on the map.

3178
03:33:17,690 --> 03:33:23,964
LAURA: I'm going to run over to-- oh shit, the imp
is still over top of Fjord.

3179
03:33:23,964 --> 03:33:26,533
LIAM: Yes, that's the threat.

3180
03:33:26,533 --> 03:33:34,262
LAURA: I'm going to make my illusion jump down and
start charging at the imp over Fjord.

3181
03:33:34,262 --> 03:33:36,208
TALIESIN: That's smart.

3182
03:33:36,208 --> 03:33:41,775
MATT: That ends your turn. That brings us to
Beau.

3183
03:33:41,775 --> 03:33:47,141
MARISHA: Once again, there is no way I can break
through the grounds and get to this imp, is there?

3184
03:33:47,141 --> 03:33:49,161
MATT: No.

3185
03:33:49,161 --> 03:33:50,875
TALIESIN: You could dash.

3186
03:33:50,875 --> 03:33:52,700
LIAM: You can get there and draw attention.

3187
03:33:52,700 --> 03:33:54,639
TRAVIS: How many imps are left?

3188
03:33:54,639 --> 03:33:56,090
TALIESIN and MATT: One.

3189
03:33:56,090 --> 03:34:01,489
MARISHA: I gave my healer's kit to her, so there's
nothing I can do to try and bring the girl back?

3190
03:34:01,489 --> 03:34:03,225
LIAM: You can soak up damage.

3191
03:34:03,225 --> 03:34:05,142
TALIESIN: She has got two more rounds regardless.

3192
03:34:05,142 --> 03:34:07,366
MARISHA: She does. She's already saved one.

3193
03:34:07,366 --> 03:34:15,172
MATT: Actually I need to make another. Okay,
success.

3194
03:34:15,172 --> 03:34:16,914
TALIESIN: Yay!

3195
03:34:16,914 --> 03:34:29,104
MARISHA: Damn, there's not a lot I can do. I guess
I'll run up. Just there. Can I pick up a rock and

3196
03:34:29,104 --> 03:34:31,574
throw a rock and be like: Get! Get on!

3197
03:34:31,574 --> 03:34:33,746
MATT: Sure, we'll call it an improvised weapon.

3198
03:34:33,746 --> 03:34:35,227
MARISHA: Get!

3199
03:34:35,227 --> 03:34:38,639
MATT: You're not proficient. So go ahead and roll
a straight attack roll.

3200
03:34:38,639 --> 03:34:40,083
LIAM: In the dark.

3201
03:34:40,083 --> 03:34:42,359
MATT: Yes, with disadvantage.

3202
03:34:42,359 --> 03:34:48,115
MARISHA: Four. 14. I guess that's a four. So ten.

3203
03:34:48,115 --> 03:34:50,230
MATT: You hear it clatter against a tree in the
distance.

3204
03:34:50,230 --> 03:34:52,861
MARISHA: Yah! Yah!

3205
03:34:52,861 --> 03:34:57,773
TRAVIS: Damn trash pandas, get out of here!

3206
03:34:57,773 --> 03:35:00,406
MATT: Caleb, make another death saving throw,
please.

3207
03:35:00,406 --> 03:35:02,084
TALIESIN: How are you doing, man?

3208
03:35:02,084 --> 03:35:03,528
LIAM: That's a success.

3209
03:35:03,528 --> 03:35:06,240
MATT: Two successes. All righty. Nott.

3210
03:35:06,240 --> 03:35:14,002
SAM: Okay, with one hand I will try to cover the
bleeding wounds of Caleb, and with the other hand,

3211
03:35:14,002 --> 03:35:16,810
not even looking, I'll just fire my crossbow at
the other--

3212
03:35:16,810 --> 03:35:18,993
(laughter)

3213
03:35:18,993 --> 03:35:21,800
SAM: At the other imp-y thing.

3214
03:35:21,800 --> 03:35:23,571
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

3215
03:35:23,571 --> 03:35:24,998
SAM: One.

3216
03:35:24,998 --> 03:35:27,243
MATT: That's what happens when you don't look!

3217
03:35:27,243 --> 03:35:28,870
SAM: I should've looked!

3218
03:35:28,870 --> 03:35:33,579
MATT: All right. Roll one more attack roll for me,
please.

3219
03:35:33,579 --> 03:35:34,938
LAURA: Oh no.

3220
03:35:34,938 --> 03:35:36,646
SAM: That's a six.

3221
03:35:36,646 --> 03:35:46,208
MATT: Six? You hear a (metallic sound) across your
shield as a bolt from a hand crossbow almost hits

3222
03:35:46,208 --> 03:35:47,484
you, Jester.

3223
03:35:47,484 --> 03:35:49,328
SAM: I'm blinded by tears!

3224
03:35:49,328 --> 03:35:51,512
(laughter)

3225
03:35:51,512 --> 03:35:56,278
TALIESIN: This is-- oh man, one imp is going to
kill us all. One fucking imp.

3226
03:35:56,278 --> 03:35:58,839
MATT: All right. Nott, does that end your turn?

3227
03:35:58,839 --> 03:36:07,497
SAM: I mean, I can't do anything. I can run over
to the other thing, but I can't do anything, so--

3228
03:36:07,497 --> 03:36:11,636
TALIESIN: We have to stabilise Fjord, is what
we've got to do.

3229
03:36:11,636 --> 03:36:14,006
SAM: And my boy--

3230
03:36:14,006 --> 03:36:15,982
TALIESIN: Caleb? Caleb's doing okay.

3231
03:36:15,982 --> 03:36:18,852
LIAM: I have two successes. Not that you know
that.

3232
03:36:18,852 --> 03:36:23,896
SAM: I don't know that, but... I'm just staying.

3233
03:36:23,896 --> 03:36:28,567
MATT: Fjord, I need you to make a death saving
throw. It's been a long time since you've had to

3234
03:36:28,567 --> 03:36:29,925
make one of these in the game.

3235
03:36:29,925 --> 03:36:30,906
TRAVIS: Three.

3236
03:36:30,906 --> 03:36:32,396
MATT: That's a fail. All righty.

3237
03:36:32,396 --> 03:36:33,675
MARISHA: Is that your first fail?

3238
03:36:33,675 --> 03:36:39,756
MATT: Top of the round. The imp-- I'm going to
make a perception check for that imp. That's not

3239
03:36:39,756 --> 03:36:45,460
good enough. The imp is going to go ahead and fly
over and attempt to take a swing at your duplicity

3240
03:36:45,460 --> 03:36:46,695
illusion.

3241
03:36:46,695 --> 03:36:48,217
MARISHA: That's good.

3242
03:36:48,217 --> 03:36:51,565
MATT: Okay. Does anything happen when the illusion
is hit?

3243
03:36:51,565 --> 03:36:57,048
LAURA: It doesn't say! It just says for the
duration you can cast spells as though you were in

3244
03:36:57,048 --> 03:36:58,462
the illusion's space.

3245
03:36:58,462 --> 03:37:00,566
MATT: Let me check just in case.

3246
03:37:00,566 --> 03:37:04,995
LAURA: I have advantage on attack rolls against
the creature if we're both within five feet of

3247
03:37:04,995 --> 03:37:06,217
each other.

3248
03:37:06,217 --> 03:37:10,917
MATT: Okay, yes. So just an illusion. So it
strikes and its stinger passes through with no

3249
03:37:10,917 --> 03:37:14,740
effect and it seems confused and figures it out.
So now it knows that it's an illusion, but it

3250
03:37:14,740 --> 03:37:21,361
wasted its attack that round. Illusions come in
handy for that. All right, that ends their turn.

3251
03:37:21,361 --> 03:37:22,389
Molly, you're up.

3252
03:37:22,389 --> 03:37:23,537
TALIESIN: I'm running right at it.

3253
03:37:23,537 --> 03:37:24,786
MATT: All righty.

3254
03:37:24,786 --> 03:37:27,280
TALIESIN: Let's try some different dice here.

3255
03:37:27,280 --> 03:37:37,707
For fuck's sake! I've got to stop rolling that
die. This is-- yeah, no.

3256
03:37:37,707 --> 03:37:39,775
LAURA: Both of them fucked you again.

3257
03:37:39,775 --> 03:37:41,943
TALIESIN: 11?

3258
03:37:41,943 --> 03:37:50,175
MATT: 11 does not hit. It's too quick. You swing
twice more and it's doing figure-eights around

3259
03:37:50,175 --> 03:37:52,411
your blades. It's frustrating the shit out of
you.

3260
03:37:52,411 --> 03:37:55,525
LAURA: Poor Molly. His arms are getting so tired
swinging both those blades.

3261
03:37:55,525 --> 03:37:57,858
TALIESIN: This is so embarrassing.

3262
03:37:57,858 --> 03:38:00,146
LIAM: The dice don't give a shit--

3263
03:38:00,146 --> 03:38:01,992
MATT: All right. Toya--

3264
03:38:01,992 --> 03:38:03,749
TALIESIN: This is so embarrassing.

3265
03:38:03,749 --> 03:38:10,909
MATT: --succeeds on her third death saving throw
and stabilizes. No, she's stabilised. A natural 20

3266
03:38:10,909 --> 03:38:15,326
is what we'd need to see for the one. All right,
so that brings us to Beau and Jester.

3267
03:38:15,326 --> 03:38:18,563
LAURA: Do you want to attack the imp?

3268
03:38:18,563 --> 03:38:20,689
MARISHA: I'll-- yeah.

3269
03:38:20,689 --> 03:38:24,122
TALIESIN: Do you get advantage because I'm engaged
with it?

3270
03:38:24,122 --> 03:38:26,172
MATT: No. It doesn't work that way.

3271
03:38:26,172 --> 03:38:27,780
MARISHA: I'm not a rogue.

3272
03:38:27,780 --> 03:38:29,224
MATT: That's right.

3273
03:38:29,224 --> 03:38:31,738
MARISHA: So seeing everyone dodge this thing, I'm
just like--

3274
03:38:31,738 --> 03:38:37,261
MATT: I mean, if you're flanking it, I'll allow
advantage on the attack. Which is like, as long as

3275
03:38:37,261 --> 03:38:39,605
you're on the complete opposite side of the foe--

3276
03:38:39,605 --> 03:38:41,320
TRAVIS: There is a convention around the imp right
now.

3277
03:38:41,320 --> 03:38:44,383
MATT: So you can-- I'll say you can get
advantage.

3278
03:38:44,383 --> 03:38:46,406
LIAM: Everyone's like, "Hey, hey, hey!"

3279
03:38:46,406 --> 03:38:47,819
MATT: Essentially, yeah.

3280
03:38:47,819 --> 03:38:49,489
TALIESIN: Ugh, look at it scoot! God!

3281
03:38:49,489 --> 03:38:51,343
MATT: So yeah, you can if you want to.

3282
03:38:51,343 --> 03:38:56,859
MARISHA: So I'm just going to run up and be like,
stupid! I'm going to try and stomp it.

3283
03:38:56,859 --> 03:39:00,266
MATT: So you're going to try and knock it to the
ground and stomp on it, is that what you're doing?

3284
03:39:00,266 --> 03:39:05,678
Because it's flying in the air. All right, first
strike. So attack with advantage.

3285
03:39:05,678 --> 03:39:08,474
LIAM: It's like that video from Ireland. Catch
it, daddy!

3286
03:39:08,474 --> 03:39:16,527
MARISHA: With advantage, right? That hits. 15,
natural. With my two-handed staff?

3287
03:39:16,527 --> 03:39:17,857
MATT: Yep.

3288
03:39:17,857 --> 03:39:26,923
MARISHA: Wait. I've already hit. Forget that.
Forget that! Eight, so 12 damage.

3289
03:39:26,923 --> 03:39:32,022
MATT: All right, so the first attack crushes the
imp and it hits the ground, the wings go limp and

3290
03:39:32,022 --> 03:39:39,862
it's dead, but you still (yells) and stomp down,
just crushing it more and more. And then its body

3291
03:39:39,862 --> 03:39:49,349
eventually just burns away into ash. So all the
threats have been neutralised and you now have two

3292
03:39:49,349 --> 03:39:50,968
friends that are bleeding out.

3293
03:39:50,968 --> 03:39:57,421
LAURA: Okay, then I'm going to run over to Fjord
and cast Cure Wounds on him so he wakes up.

3294
03:39:57,421 --> 03:39:59,555
MATT: You come back to consciousness.

3295
03:39:59,555 --> 03:40:02,161
LAURA: With five hit points.

3296
03:40:02,161 --> 03:40:06,175
SAM: I will try to stabilise Caleb using no--

3297
03:40:06,175 --> 03:40:08,760
MATT: Caleb, I need you to make a death save.

3298
03:40:08,760 --> 03:40:10,223
LIAM: Death save? Fail.

3299
03:40:10,223 --> 03:40:13,640
MATT: All righty. Make a medicine check.

3300
03:40:13,640 --> 03:40:19,468
SAM: Natural 20. And I will do mouth-to-mouth.

3301
03:40:19,468 --> 03:40:23,865
MATT: I will say for the purposes of this, you
watch as Nott pulls the porcelain mask back and

3302
03:40:23,865 --> 03:40:31,343
just gives Caleb the most terrifying
mouth-to-mouth you've ever seen. Caleb, the

3303
03:40:31,343 --> 03:40:37,223
darkness fades and you come to consciousness. The
first things you notice are the cold temperature,

3304
03:40:37,223 --> 03:40:49,959
the taste of iron in your mouth, and the vision of
Nott pulling away from you like a terrifying

3305
03:40:49,959 --> 03:40:51,631
Nosferatu.

3306
03:40:51,631 --> 03:40:54,261
TRAVIS: Oh Jesus! Like Willem Dafoe as--

3307
03:40:54,261 --> 03:41:02,369
LIAM: Caleb goes (yelps), and I cast Dancing
Lights into the goblin and light her up! Ah!

3308
03:41:02,369 --> 03:41:04,761
TRAVIS: Even worse.

3309
03:41:04,761 --> 03:41:06,708
MATT: (laughs) Temporarily blinded.

3310
03:41:06,708 --> 03:41:11,978
LIAM: What the hell happened?

3311
03:41:11,978 --> 03:41:14,648
MARISHA: It's like 2am and the lights come on at
the club.

3312
03:41:14,648 --> 03:41:17,442
SAM: Ugh, that's what she looked like?

3313
03:41:17,442 --> 03:41:19,389
(laughter)

3314
03:41:19,389 --> 03:41:26,559
LAURA: Oh man, I start dancing around in a circle
with my illusion. We did it, guys!

3315
03:41:26,559 --> 03:41:29,617
MATT: You watch as two Jesters start doing a
little skip.

3316
03:41:29,617 --> 03:41:31,678
MARISHA: I immediately run to Toya.

3317
03:41:31,678 --> 03:41:35,181
TALIESIN: I was about to say, I'm going to run to
Toya and pick her up. I've got her. I've got her.

3318
03:41:35,181 --> 03:41:39,154
MARISHA: Do you-- I've got her. I could hold her,
though.

3319
03:41:39,154 --> 03:41:40,713
TALIESIN: I've got her.

3320
03:41:40,713 --> 03:41:42,181
MARISHA: Why--

3321
03:41:42,181 --> 03:41:48,131
TALIESIN: Because you were the last face she saw?
I should probably be the first. Thank you. You did

3322
03:41:48,131 --> 03:41:52,580
the right thing. You don't need to be the first
thing she sees. She'll just start screaming all

3323
03:41:52,580 --> 03:41:54,980
over again. Thank you.

3324
03:41:54,980 --> 03:41:58,255
TRAVIS: Anything of the toad?

3325
03:41:58,255 --> 03:42:00,561
TALIESIN: We're going to need him.

3326
03:42:00,561 --> 03:42:03,466
LAURA: Oh yeah. I want to go over and start
searching his body.

3327
03:42:03,466 --> 03:42:06,438
TRAVIS: I thought it burned away, no?

3328
03:42:06,438 --> 03:42:11,878
MATT: A large part of the torso just burned away.
The inside is partially burned out to embers in

3329
03:42:11,878 --> 03:42:15,386
the blast, but there's still probably 60 percent
of the body remaining.

3330
03:42:15,386 --> 03:42:18,966
LIAM: DM, am I at one hit point at this moment? It
was zero.

3331
03:42:18,966 --> 03:42:22,169
MATT: You would be at one hit point when you come
to consciousness. I'm giving you that because of

3332
03:42:22,169 --> 03:42:25,821
the natural 20. Any other roll, you would just be
stabilised.

3333
03:42:25,821 --> 03:42:27,102
LIAM: True love's kiss.

3334
03:42:27,102 --> 03:42:28,611
MATT: Exactly. (laughs)

3335
03:42:28,611 --> 03:42:30,371
LAURA: Investigation or perception?

3336
03:42:30,371 --> 03:42:32,643
MATT: This is investigation, because you're poring
through the--

3337
03:42:32,643 --> 03:42:33,968
LAURA: 14.

3338
03:42:33,968 --> 03:42:45,458
MATT: 14. You find a small pouch of flesh, like a
little hiding pouch that you kind of reach in a

3339
03:42:45,458 --> 03:42:52,465
little bit and it has kind of a mucus-y liquid on
the inside. As you reach in, your fingers find

3340
03:42:52,465 --> 03:42:57,690
what appear to be a few small stones you can feel
at the tip of your fingers. Do you pull them out?

3341
03:42:57,690 --> 03:42:58,913
LAURA: Okay.

3342
03:42:58,913 --> 03:43:07,293
MATT: You pull it out. It's a handful of jewels.
Looks like rings, necklaces. There's actually a

3343
03:43:07,293 --> 03:43:11,517
few stolen pieces of jewelry that are in the pouch
as well as a few coin.

3344
03:43:11,517 --> 03:43:21,050
LAURA: What? This is awesome. Here, Fjord, I found
a cloister of seamen for you.

3345
03:43:21,050 --> 03:43:30,264
TRAVIS: What is it? What did you give me? What is
this?

3346
03:43:30,264 --> 03:43:34,104
LAURA: It's a bag of stuff that I think you will
like. I already removed all the fancy stuff from

3347
03:43:34,104 --> 03:43:35,291
it though.

3348
03:43:35,291 --> 03:43:36,687
SAM: So it's just gooey flesh?

3349
03:43:36,687 --> 03:43:39,461
TALIESIN: That's definitely a cloister. It's a
nu-gget.

3350
03:43:39,461 --> 03:43:41,042
TRAVIS: That's foul.

3351
03:43:41,042 --> 03:43:48,073
MATT: But other than that, it is devoid of any
other items or objects and it looks like that was

3352
03:43:48,073 --> 03:43:50,546
its running fund.

3353
03:43:50,546 --> 03:43:53,715
LAURA: Whoa! I put all of the jewels on my
fingers.

3354
03:43:53,715 --> 03:43:57,414
MATT: They're still slick but easy to put on
because they're lubricated.

3355
03:43:57,414 --> 03:43:59,153
LAURA: Nott, look at me.

3356
03:43:59,153 --> 03:44:01,334
SAM: Those are very nice.

3357
03:44:01,334 --> 03:44:03,234
LAURA: Aren't these pretty rocks?

3358
03:44:03,234 --> 03:44:07,273
SAM: They are very pretty, yes. Where did you find
them?

3359
03:44:07,273 --> 03:44:08,691
LAURA: On the bag.

3360
03:44:08,691 --> 03:44:13,502
SAM: On the bag? Can I have one?

3361
03:44:13,502 --> 03:44:22,044
LAURA: Yes, but first, can I use a ritual spell?
Does that work against-- Yeah. I can do ritual spells?

3362
03:44:22,044 --> 03:44:25,262
MATT: You can do ritual spells and it won't take a
spell slot, just takes ten minutes more of casting

3363
03:44:25,262 --> 03:44:26,451
time to do it.

3364
03:44:26,451 --> 03:44:27,761
LAURA: Can I Detect Magic on it?

3365
03:44:27,761 --> 03:44:32,876
MATT: You may. So you take a little bit of time
concentrating on it. At the end of the spell, you

3366
03:44:32,876 --> 03:44:37,643
send out your extended consciousness, but they do
not resonate anything magical.

3367
03:44:37,643 --> 03:44:41,097
LAURA: Hmm, they're just plain rings, but they're
very pretty.

3368
03:44:41,097 --> 03:44:43,843
MATT: They are pretty.

3369
03:44:43,843 --> 03:44:46,276
MARISHA: What are you going to do with the girl?

3370
03:44:46,276 --> 03:44:49,366
TALIESIN: (sighs) Get her back home.

3371
03:44:49,366 --> 03:44:51,231
MARISHA: Where's home for a traveling circus?

3372
03:44:51,231 --> 03:44:52,908
SAM: What if she's evil?

3373
03:44:52,908 --> 03:44:56,130
TALIESIN: I know. We're going to have a talk.

3374
03:44:56,130 --> 03:44:57,895
LAURA: We should bring her to the--

3375
03:44:57,895 --> 03:44:59,252
SAM: Authorities.

3376
03:44:59,252 --> 03:45:07,103
LAURA: So that she can defend us. So that she can
tell everyone that the fiend was bad.

3377
03:45:07,103 --> 03:45:09,307
MARISHA: I don't know if she feels that way.

3378
03:45:09,307 --> 03:45:11,848
TALIESIN: I don't know if she feels that way
either, but although-- it's going to take some

3379
03:45:11,848 --> 03:45:21,848
time, I think. And also, we're going to need the
body, and honestly, only one of us was here. For

3380
03:45:21,848 --> 03:45:25,514
those at home, I'm pointing at Caleb.

3381
03:45:25,514 --> 03:45:27,180
TRAVIS: Well, why was he the only one?

3382
03:45:27,180 --> 03:45:29,045
TALIESIN: Because the rest of us are under
arrest.

3383
03:45:29,045 --> 03:45:31,639
TRAVIS: That's very true.

3384
03:45:31,639 --> 03:45:38,426
TALIESIN: So congratulations on single-handedly
defeating the creature that killed several guards.

3385
03:45:38,426 --> 03:45:41,192
I'm sure you will be well-rewarded and
compensated.

3386
03:45:41,192 --> 03:45:43,745
LAURA: You are a very powerful wizard.

3387
03:45:43,745 --> 03:45:51,376
LIAM: Yeah, you know, ain't nothing. (coughs)
(high-pitched) Oh!

3388
03:45:51,376 --> 03:45:53,240
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's how I feel.

3389
03:45:53,240 --> 03:45:57,546
LAURA: Can I use my healing kit and help heal him?
Does that work, or does it just bring somebody

3390
03:45:57,546 --> 03:45:58,538
back to consciousness?

3391
03:45:58,538 --> 03:46:00,986
MATT: It just helps stabilise. There's a feat you
can take that makes it do more.

3392
03:46:00,986 --> 03:46:02,756
LAURA: Oh really? Okay, cool.

3393
03:46:02,756 --> 03:46:06,208
LIAM: Do you have any anything left in you?

3394
03:46:06,208 --> 03:46:07,809
LAURA: I got nothing.

3395
03:46:07,809 --> 03:46:09,371
LIAM: Well, okay.

3396
03:46:09,371 --> 03:46:11,374
LAURA: I can heal you in the morning.

3397
03:46:11,374 --> 03:46:14,648
LIAM: Or we could just sit here for a bit and I
could catch my breath, I think.

3398
03:46:14,648 --> 03:46:17,306
LAURA: We can rest for 30 minutes or an hour or
so.

3399
03:46:17,306 --> 03:46:18,950
TALIESIN: Let's take a rest.

3400
03:46:18,950 --> 03:46:24,405
MATT: All right. As you guys sit here in the
quiet, you can hear the crickets now; the rest of

3401
03:46:24,405 --> 03:46:30,999
the sound of the forest has fallen away and the
din of the battle has vanished. The moonlight gets

3402
03:46:30,999 --> 03:46:37,999
a bit brighter as the moon climbs higher in the
sky. And you all kind of look around at each

3403
03:46:37,999 --> 03:46:47,221
other. Through this haphazard series of events
you've come to assemble a skillset that seems to

3404
03:46:47,221 --> 03:46:54,525
overlap pretty well. And hopefully it's enough to
clear your name. But we'll find that out next

3405
03:46:54,525 --> 03:47:01,759
week. So we're going to end the episode. We'll be
back to continue that thread next Thursday.

3406
03:47:01,759 --> 03:47:03,760
MARISHA: But I want to, like, keep going.

3407
03:47:03,760 --> 03:47:06,579
MATT: I know, but it's 10:45!

3408
03:47:06,579 --> 03:47:10,652
LAURA: I would just like to say that as we're
resting there, I'm closing my eyes and keeping a

3409
03:47:10,652 --> 03:47:17,527
hand down close to Nott with my rings on my
fingers.

3410
03:47:17,527 --> 03:47:19,608
SAM: I'm going to try to take one off.

3411
03:47:19,608 --> 03:47:22,423
MATT: Sleight of hand.

3412
03:47:22,423 --> 03:47:26,387
SAM: Eight-- 26.

3413
03:47:26,387 --> 03:47:31,550
MATT: I don't even think you have high enough
perception at all. You have a very nice--

3414
03:47:31,550 --> 03:47:33,043
LAURA: It was all the mucus on the ring.

3415
03:47:33,043 --> 03:47:34,637
MATT: Yep.

3416
03:47:34,637 --> 03:47:37,998
SAM: I'm just going to say, I did it.

3417
03:47:37,998 --> 03:47:40,135
(laughter)

3418
03:47:40,135 --> 03:47:42,052
LAURA: I'm so proud of you.

3419
03:47:42,052 --> 03:47:46,949
MATT: Aw. And we'll leave it at that. All right,
thank you guys so much for watching. I'm excited

3420
03:47:46,949 --> 03:47:48,367
to continue this next week.

3421
03:47:48,367 --> 03:47:50,128
LIAM: Man, I got the full wizard experience
tonight.

3422
03:47:50,128 --> 03:47:51,551
MATT: Yeah, you did!

3423
03:47:51,551 --> 03:47:58,817
(laughter)

3424
03:47:58,817 --> 03:48:04,109
MATT: Oh man. Well done, that's your first boss
fight of the campaign!

3425
03:48:04,109 --> 03:48:05,321
MARISHA: Oh my god!

3426
03:48:05,321 --> 03:48:06,502
TALIESIN: That was so unpleasant.

3427
03:48:06,502 --> 03:48:07,599
LAURA: Good job, Fjord!

3428
03:48:07,599 --> 03:48:09,211
MATT: Two of you went down.

3429
03:48:09,211 --> 03:48:12,345
MARISHA: Does this mean we level up?

3430
03:48:12,345 --> 03:48:15,892
MATT: Well, because we are doing milestone
leveling with this campaign--

3431
03:48:15,892 --> 03:48:17,214
SAM: What does that mean?

3432
03:48:17,214 --> 03:48:20,858
MATT: That means there's no experience points, but
at the end of each major story beat,

3433
03:48:20,858 --> 03:48:25,775
like a big moment that I see fit, then everyone
will level up together.

3434
03:48:25,775 --> 03:48:27,696
MARISHA: So do you see fit?

3435
03:48:27,696 --> 03:48:32,312
MATT: I will see fit when this arc concludes, so
end of next episode, probably, everyone's going to

3436
03:48:32,312 --> 03:48:36,915
hit level three. So start thinking about-- for
those of you who have to choose a path, think

3437
03:48:36,915 --> 03:48:39,599
about what you want to do if you haven't already.

3438
03:48:39,599 --> 03:48:43,611
TALIESIN: I think I'm going to multiclass.

3439
03:48:43,611 --> 03:48:46,679
LIAM: Seven times.

3440
03:48:46,679 --> 03:48:48,882
TALIESIN: Master of none.

3441
03:48:48,882 --> 03:48:54,342
MATT: Not even passable. (laughs) All right, thank
you guys so much for watching. Thank you again,

3442
03:48:54,342 --> 03:48:59,056
D&D Beyond, for being our awesome partner and
sponsor for the leg of this campaign. Hope you all

3443
03:48:59,056 --> 03:49:03,034
have a wonderful weekend, and is it Thursday yet?
Have a good night.

3444
03:49:03,034 --> 03:49:04,152
TRAVIS: We lived!

3445
03:49:04,152 --> 03:49:07,575
MARISHA: We lived! Episode three!

3446
03:49:07,575 --> 03:59:23,588
