00:00:00,122 --> 00:00:03,504
MATT: Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical
Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

2
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:08,556
sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. Oh, that
was good. Well done.

3
00:00:08,556 --> 00:00:10,463
LIAM: We all had to fought to be heard that time.

4
00:00:10,463 --> 00:00:13,681
MATT: Yeah! It helps when you all say it at once
because it just becomes noise at that point and

5
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:19,169
nothing really affects me. I find it funny, it
amuses. So yes, welcome! Before we jump into

6
00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:23,675
tonight's game, let's go through some quick
announcements. First and foremost, we have

7
00:00:23,675 --> 00:00:28,092
returning our fantastic sponsor and partner for
the beginning of this campaign into the

8
00:00:28,092 --> 00:00:29,730
foreseeable future: D&D Beyond!

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,321
TRAVIS: D&D Beyond!

10
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:33,032
MATT: Sam, do you have a--

11
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:40,780
SAM: Guys, check out DnDBeyond.com. They're giving
away a Legendary Bundle on their Facebook page. A

12
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,275
Legendary Bundle contains every digital source
available on D&D Beyond, all reference books,

13
00:00:45,275 --> 00:00:52,838
including a pre-order for Mordenkainen's Tome of
Foes. Go to Facebook.com/DnDBeyond, check out that

14
00:00:52,838 --> 00:00:59,110
top pinned post for instructions. Last week, as
you all know, I sent out a request saying, "Send

15
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:09,134
"me your stories of D&D Beyond, mail me your
stories," so I got some viewer mail to read. "Dear

16
00:01:09,134 --> 00:01:11,795
"Sam, you're my favorite on Critical Role, don't
tell Travis!"

17
00:01:11,795 --> 00:01:12,977
TRAVIS: Fucking dicks.

18
00:01:12,977 --> 00:01:18,355
SAM: "Also a big fan of D&D Beyond, but had one
question: Was that you I saw in Studio City,

19
00:01:18,355 --> 00:01:22,945
"running around covered only in mayonnaise? If so,
what the hell, dude?" I don't know what that is.

20
00:01:22,945 --> 00:01:30,585
"Dear Sam, I own a convenience store, we have your
show on our TV all the time, love you as Nott, but

21
00:01:30,585 --> 00:01:34,997
"please be aware I've filed an injunction to keep
you a hundred feet away from the store. We have

22
00:01:34,997 --> 00:01:41,075
"you on-camera stealing jars of mayonnaise and
smearing them all over your body. PS: D&D Beyond

23
00:01:41,075 --> 00:01:48,764
"rocks." Okay. "Dear Sam, to answer your question:
No, we do not consider 16 jars of Hellman's

24
00:01:48,764 --> 00:01:54,285
"mayonnaise slathered over your naked body
appropriate attire for our furry convention. No,

25
00:01:54,285 --> 00:01:59,319
"it does not matter if you use Cool-Whip instead,
your credentials have been revoked, please stop

26
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:06,489
"asking." There's nothing even about D&D Beyond in
that one. But hey! D&D Beyond!

27
00:02:06,489 --> 00:02:12,888
MATT: Didn't realize mayonnaise could be a
fursona, but I guess we all learned something

28
00:02:12,888 --> 00:02:14,468
tonight. Thank you, Sam.

29
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,466
TRAVIS: It's great camouflage.

30
00:02:16,466 --> 00:02:19,356
LIAM: I think Matt went dead inside.

31
00:02:19,356 --> 00:02:22,130
LAURA: I was looking at his face as that was going
on, was like--

32
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:26,346
MATT: What is going on, Sam? Thank you, Sam.

33
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:30,363
LIAM: I guess somebody at this table used to go to
furry conventions.

34
00:02:30,363 --> 00:02:34,874
MATT: Nothing wrong with that, unless you're
covered in mayonnaise.

35
00:02:34,874 --> 00:02:37,673
LIAM: It does not go well with fur.

36
00:02:37,673 --> 00:02:45,354
MATT: Exactly. Another reminder for those of you
who have Amazon Prime, can go on Twitch and use

37
00:02:45,354 --> 00:02:50,736
your Prime account to subscribe for free to any
channel you want to, every month, and I think they

38
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:54,874
just put out an email to Prime members that they
have a new way of making sure it notifies you

39
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:57,897
whenever your subscription is up, so you can know
when that's happening, which is pretty useful.

40
00:02:57,897 --> 00:03:04,512
Also, Talks Machina, of course, is every Tuesday
night at 7:00PM Pacific here on Twitch and Project

41
00:03:04,512 --> 00:03:07,125
Alpha, hosted by our fantastic Brian W. Foster.

42
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,696
TRAVIS: Hey!

43
00:03:08,696 --> 00:03:11,733
MARISHA: Nailed it! You know our friend's name.

44
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:26,015
MATT: That's going to be your announcement from
now on. Cabbageman Foster is a fantastic host of

45
00:03:26,015 --> 00:03:31,546
the show, you can check him out next week, thank
you, Brian. Podcast of last week's episode is

46
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:35,502
available where all fine podcasts downloadable, so
if you want the audio version, or your friends are

47
00:03:35,502 --> 00:03:39,978
listening to the audio versions, they can find it
now and be caught up after this episode, I guess.

48
00:03:39,978 --> 00:03:41,444
LAURA: (loud whisper) Can I have a pencil?

49
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,525
MARISHA: (loud whisper) Yeah.

50
00:03:42,595 --> 00:03:43,566
MATT: I'm talking!

51
00:03:43,566 --> 00:03:45,351
LAURA: I'm sorry. I just saw that she had
pencils.

52
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:46,674
LIAM: I have a bunch as well.

53
00:03:46,674 --> 00:03:51,917
MATT: That's okay. Heads up to all of our fans, we're
going to be at Emerald City Comic Con. Our good

54
00:03:51,917 --> 00:03:56,099
friends at Dark Horse will be selling the print
version of Vox Machina: Origins #1.

55
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:57,590
SAM: They already are, aren't they?

56
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,636
LAURA: Yeah, it's happening

57
00:03:58,636 --> 00:04:01,208
MATT: Oh, that's right, because it's already there!
There you go.

58
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,509
LIAM: And there's copies for us in this building
somewhere.

59
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:04,730
MARISHA: Are there?

60
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,589
TALIESIN: You have fluff on your chin.

61
00:04:06,589 --> 00:04:07,679
LAURA: You got it.

62
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:08,672
TRAVIS: Just leave it there.

63
00:04:08,672 --> 00:04:09,670
MATT: There you go.

64
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,136
TRAVIS: That's right. There's a limited number.

65
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,052
MATT: Yeah, they only have 1000 copies, so if
you're going to get one, get it soon.

66
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:13,994
LAURA: That's it?

67
00:04:13,994 --> 00:04:14,966
LIAM: Yeah, that's it.

68
00:04:14,966 --> 00:04:16,351
LAURA: They might be gone already!

69
00:04:16,351 --> 00:04:17,239
LIAM: Could be.

70
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:18,902
LAURA: It's gone, you got it.

71
00:04:18,902 --> 00:04:25,691
MATT: The limit's only five copies per person, per
day, so we'll see how that works out. That's Dark

72
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:29,308
Horse, booth 1708 at the event, so if you're going
to be there, look for that. Also, you'll be able

73
00:04:29,308 --> 00:04:32,103
to look for these two folks. You guys are flying
out to that tomorrow, right?

74
00:04:32,103 --> 00:04:33,019
TRAVIS: We are.

75
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:35,065
LAURA: Early, early, early in the morning.

76
00:04:35,065 --> 00:04:38,369
TRAVIS: We'll be there around noon thirty for our
first panel of the day.

77
00:04:38,369 --> 00:04:43,370
LAURA: We have a couple of Critical Role things
tomorrow, so come say hi.

78
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:50,566
MATT: Issue five of the comic book, by the way,
goes up March 7th, so next week, you'll be able to

79
00:04:50,566 --> 00:04:53,523
check out the fifth comic, the next stage in the
story.

80
00:04:53,523 --> 00:04:55,110
LIAM: Character development.

81
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,827
MATT: It's pretty awesome, actually. I'm excited
for you guys to check it out. I'm excited to read

82
00:04:58,827 --> 00:05:03,242
it myself, so keep an eye out for that. You can
find it on Dark Horse's digital comics platform,

83
00:05:03,242 --> 00:05:06,288
comiXology, and many other places you can find
on the Geek & Sundry website that I didn't

84
00:05:06,288 --> 00:05:14,901
bother to put down. Once again, reminding that
826LA and 826 in general is our partner-friend

85
00:05:14,943 --> 00:05:17,673
charity from the very beginning of this whole
stream and we're still pushing them because

86
00:05:17,673 --> 00:05:20,685
they're amazing. Check them out if you haven't had
the chance; they do great work, and maybe you can

87
00:05:20,685 --> 00:05:23,132
do great work with them either by helping support
them--

88
00:05:23,132 --> 00:05:30,037
MARISHA: Go volunteer! Go start a D&D club! Hit
them up! Kids and D&D are hilarious.

89
00:05:30,037 --> 00:05:38,634
MATT: As a heads up, I'll be at Lexington Comic &
Toy Convention next weekend in Kentucky, so for

90
00:05:38,634 --> 00:05:40,694
those of you guys who are in that vicinity, come
say hello to me!

91
00:05:40,694 --> 00:05:41,534
MARISHA: Represent!

92
00:05:41,534 --> 00:05:42,432
MATT: Exactly.

93
00:05:42,432 --> 00:05:45,957
MARISHA: Hometown! Well, not really. An hour and a
half outside my hometown!

94
00:05:45,957 --> 00:05:46,989
TRAVIS: Partial, yeah.

95
00:05:46,989 --> 00:05:47,879
MARISHA: Yeah.

96
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:50,975
MATT: Relatively. It's fine. Come and hopefully
see me there! We'll have events and signings and

97
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:55,741
all kinds of good stuff, so, yay! I think that's
almost all of the announcements?

98
00:05:55,741 --> 00:06:05,871
MARISHA: We're Alive just came out on Project
Alpha with the amazing horror aficionado Ivan Van

99
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:10,390
Norman. It's awesome. It's based off of the "We're
Alive" podcast; it's "We're Alive: Frontier."

100
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:17,957
It's, oh man, you guys have to go watch it. Next
week is the first episode of my new show with Mr.

101
00:06:17,957 --> 00:06:22,289
Matt Key: Key Question! That's on Tuesday.

102
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:23,773
LAURA: I'm excited about that one.

103
00:06:23,773 --> 00:06:31,723
MARISHA: It's going to be good. It's got some good
shit in it, been looking at the edits. So yeah. Go watch.

104
00:06:31,723 --> 00:06:36,247
MATT: And... I think that's it, right?

105
00:06:36,247 --> 00:06:44,606
LAURA: Oh, well, there's one little thing, which
is that Travis and I are... having a baby!

106
00:06:44,606 --> 00:06:47,880
(cheering)

107
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,135
LAURA: All this! This right here!

108
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,818
TRAVIS: Look at this one, too.

109
00:06:53,818 --> 00:06:56,554
(laughter)

110
00:06:56,554 --> 00:06:58,952
TALIESIN: That's currently available in the store
right now.

111
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:00,394
LAURA: That's available in the store.

112
00:07:00,394 --> 00:07:02,796
TRAVIS: Limited number, limited quality. I think
there are only one.

113
00:07:02,796 --> 00:07:05,535
MARISHA: Available where you can find all babies.

114
00:07:05,535 --> 00:07:12,425
LAURA: Very excited to not have to hide it on the
show anymore! Thanks for blocking my belly the

115
00:07:12,425 --> 00:07:13,531
whole time.

116
00:07:13,531 --> 00:07:16,096
SAM: Certainly. Your turn to block mine!

117
00:07:16,096 --> 00:07:17,154
LAURA: Yay!

118
00:07:17,154 --> 00:07:19,358
MATT: We got our new Critter coming. So excited.

119
00:07:19,358 --> 00:07:24,006
LAURA: That's right. We rolled a character sheet
for our baby on our announcement.

120
00:07:24,006 --> 00:07:26,635
MARISHA: I like Bladder Kick. That one's my
favorite.

121
00:07:26,635 --> 00:07:30,243
MATT: That was pretty great. If you guys haven't
seen it yet on Laura and Travis' Twitter, you can

122
00:07:30,243 --> 00:07:32,244
go and see the announcement page. It's pretty
adorable.

123
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:33,893
TRAVIS: I like his flaws: poops his pants.

124
00:07:33,893 --> 00:07:38,512
MATT: It's a pretty big flaw... and for some
people it's a strength. I don't know.

125
00:07:38,512 --> 00:07:42,375
LIAM: The baby is sitting playing Dungeons &
Dragons with us.

126
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,683
LIAM and LAURA: Right now.

127
00:07:44,683 --> 00:07:45,953
LAURA: Oh.

128
00:07:45,953 --> 00:07:48,172
MARISHA: The baby is being watched by so many
people.

129
00:07:48,172 --> 00:07:49,824
LAURA: Don't be shy baby, it's okay!

130
00:07:49,824 --> 00:07:53,265
SAM: Hey, are you guys going to hold a Critter
contest to name your child?

131
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:57,570
LAURA: What a good idea, Sam! No!

132
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,810
(laughter)

133
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,867
TRAVIS: Son of a-- go ahead and do that. Go
ahead.

134
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:05,506
LIAM: Send those suggestions to @laurabaileyVO on
twitter.com!

135
00:08:05,506 --> 00:08:07,382
MARISHA: You're definitely live-streaming the
birth though, right?

136
00:08:07,382 --> 00:08:12,601
LAURA: Oh, live-streaming the birth. We're going
to Periscope the birth for sure. My goal is to go

137
00:08:12,601 --> 00:08:15,807
into labor while we're playing on a Thursday
night.

138
00:08:15,807 --> 00:08:17,398
MATT: We laugh now.

139
00:08:17,398 --> 00:08:19,086
LAURA: How great would that be?

140
00:08:19,086 --> 00:08:20,397
MATT: Oh, man.

141
00:08:20,397 --> 00:08:23,600
LIAM: Well, we played the game once in that back
office, so we could just move to you and then

142
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,782
bring the stuff with us.

143
00:08:24,782 --> 00:08:26,092
MATT: That's true, yeah!

144
00:08:26,092 --> 00:08:28,262
LIAM: Dwarven Forge, Dwarven Forge, Dwarven
Forge.

145
00:08:28,262 --> 00:08:33,036
MATT: On that note! Congratulations to the two of
you guys, we're all super excited for you.

146
00:08:33,036 --> 00:08:34,479
ALL: Yay!

147
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:41,195
MATT: And with that, let's go ahead and dive into
tonight's episode of Critical Role!

148
00:08:41,195 --> 00:08:45,028
[click, TV static]

149
00:08:45,028 --> 00:10:02,945
[groovy Critical Role theme]

150
00:10:02,945 --> 00:10:10,461
MATT: Welcome back. And welcome back, Laura, when
she gets done using the restroom. Where we left

151
00:10:10,461 --> 00:10:15,460
off, you guys have been travelling northward into
the Marrow Valley, eventually making your way

152
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:20,217
towards the city of Zadash. Along the way, you
were passing by the city of Alfield just past the

153
00:10:20,217 --> 00:10:26,148
sunset as an incursion of a gnoll warband began to
set fire to a number of the buildings. You rushed

154
00:10:26,148 --> 00:10:31,958
in to aid some of the denizens there, jumped in
under the watch of Bryce, the Watchmaster there,

155
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:37,848
and managed to slay a few, but they managed to
escape with a number of bodies and living members

156
00:10:37,848 --> 00:10:43,695
of the community. You were then given the
opportunity to make some money and to wreak some

157
00:10:43,695 --> 00:10:48,525
proper vengeance for this town by finding out
where these gnolls were and retrieve those who

158
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:53,970
were still living and/or the bodies of those that
needed to at least be given a proper burial. Along

159
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:58,275
that path, you discovered this underground network
of what was an abandoned mine where they had been

160
00:10:58,275 --> 00:11:02,692
holing up. While you were travelling down there
and battling with these gnolls as you did, you

161
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:09,623
encountered a new ally: this individual named
Shakäste and his amazing little dark hummingbird.

162
00:11:09,623 --> 00:11:16,459
All of you together managed to make your way
through, save a number of lives-- (burps) pardon

163
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:27,231
me-- encounter the priest of these gnollish
creatures who had been using these members of the

164
00:11:27,231 --> 00:11:35,785
town to help feed a mother manticore. To retrieve
some of the living members, you managed to get

165
00:11:35,785 --> 00:11:42,522
into battle with it. Nott slew the baby manticore,
drawing its ire, and you all, by the skin of your

166
00:11:42,522 --> 00:11:47,583
teeth, took both the priest and her out, and in
doing so saved the lives of those that were

167
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:52,210
within, retrieved a small bounty of things that
were caught within the nest and the priest's

168
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:56,732
corpse, and made your way back to town. Upon
arriving--

169
00:11:56,732 --> 00:12:01,623
(shuffling chairs, laughter)

170
00:12:01,623 --> 00:12:04,230
TRAVIS: Anything for that butt-shot, Sam.

171
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:11,041
MATT: That's Sam's gift to you guys. Upon
returning, the sun had set. A number of members of

172
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:15,459
the city of Alfield began to thank you for what
you've done. They began to come out into the

173
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:23,526
streets and began to make small campfires and play
music and basically take this moment to both

174
00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:28,944
grieve and be thankful that there are individuals
who will stand up and show strength in the face of

175
00:12:28,944 --> 00:12:36,829
darkness even this far out on the edges of the
empire. In this time, you realize right about now

176
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:43,370
that your new friend Shakäste seems to have
vanished from the vicinity. You glance about, and

177
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,873
at a quick look, he's gone.

178
00:12:46,873 --> 00:12:51,265
LAURA: Where did Shakäste go?

179
00:12:51,265 --> 00:12:56,422
SAM: I don't know. He's very mysterious.

180
00:12:56,422 --> 00:12:58,019
MARISHA: He's the coolest.

181
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:03,045
LAURA: He's like the wind. (gasps) Maybe he was the
Traveler!

182
00:13:03,045 --> 00:13:05,592
SAM: What does that mean, the Traveler?

183
00:13:05,592 --> 00:13:06,918
LAURA: The Traveler.

184
00:13:06,918 --> 00:13:08,609
SAM: What does that mean?

185
00:13:08,609 --> 00:13:10,532
TRAVIS: It's like a deity.

186
00:13:10,532 --> 00:13:13,841
LAURA: Well, yeah, mostly. Yeah.

187
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:15,449
SAM: Oh.

188
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:16,989
LAURA: I mean, he takes many forms.

189
00:13:16,989 --> 00:13:20,363
SAM: Do you worship the Traveler?

190
00:13:20,363 --> 00:13:21,864
LAURA: Maybe I'm the Traveler.

191
00:13:21,864 --> 00:13:24,475
SAM: Okay, maybe she doesn't worship the
Traveler.

192
00:13:24,475 --> 00:13:29,656
LAURA: I mean, yeah, sure. I worship him, sure.
He's more like my best friend.

193
00:13:29,656 --> 00:13:35,697
TRAVIS: Jester, don't you think that if that was
the Traveler he would have said, "Hey. I'm the Traveler."

194
00:13:35,697 --> 00:13:37,645
LAURA: Probably.

195
00:13:37,645 --> 00:13:43,266
MARISHA: He didn't seem very irreverent in the way
the Traveler seems to be.

196
00:13:43,266 --> 00:13:44,476
TRAVIS: Yep.

197
00:13:44,476 --> 00:13:47,898
LAURA: How do you know what the Traveler's like?
Do you hang out with the Traveler too?

198
00:13:47,898 --> 00:13:49,659
MARISHA: No, but I hang out with you.

199
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:53,763
LAURA: Oh, right. Well, he's probably not the
Traveler, then.

200
00:13:53,763 --> 00:13:57,689
LIAM: I liked that guy, though. He was good.

201
00:13:57,689 --> 00:13:58,849
MARISHA: He was.

202
00:13:58,849 --> 00:13:59,983
TRAVIS: He was pretty cool.

203
00:13:59,983 --> 00:14:01,165
LIAM: He was talented.

204
00:14:01,165 --> 00:14:06,263
SAM: Are you okay, Caleb? You went a little quiet
there for a little while.

205
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:09,658
MARISHA: Is that your first time killing
something? Or somebody?

206
00:14:09,658 --> 00:14:12,867
LIAM: He was burned alive in front of me.

207
00:14:12,867 --> 00:14:15,771
MARISHA: Yeah, you did that, though.

208
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:27,077
LIAM: I am well aware that I killed a person. I
have nothing else to say, why is everyone looking at me?

209
00:14:27,077 --> 00:14:29,796
LAURA: Have you ever killed someone before?

210
00:14:29,796 --> 00:14:36,173
TRAVIS: We were worried. You kind of went into a
state. Just making sure you are all right.

211
00:14:36,173 --> 00:14:37,487
LIAM: I'm okay.

212
00:14:37,487 --> 00:14:38,959
TRAVIS: All right, yeah.

213
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:44,454
LIAM: It was terribly grisly; his hair was on fire
and he burned horribly. Maybe it went a little

214
00:14:44,454 --> 00:14:51,983
further than I anticipated-- I have killed people
before in defense, ja. But not like that.

215
00:14:51,983 --> 00:14:57,182
TALIESIN: Well, there's one surefire way to make
sure that he's all right, which is, we get drunk

216
00:14:57,182 --> 00:15:04,574
on something really expensive and listen to the
stories of all the people we just saved so you

217
00:15:04,574 --> 00:15:06,672
can feel better about everything that just
happened.

218
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,705
LIAM: Okay, that sounds good.

219
00:15:08,705 --> 00:15:11,750
TALIESIN: And we're going to spend a ridiculous amount
of the money we just made.

220
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,030
LAURA: I'm okay with that.

221
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,254
MARISHA: I am too.

222
00:15:16,254 --> 00:15:20,442
SAM: Oh, didn't we get some items as well?

223
00:15:20,442 --> 00:15:23,523
LAURA: Oh, yeah! Who was it that had that stuff?

224
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:30,899
TRAVIS: Apparently, I raise my hand in this group.
That just happened.

225
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:32,939
TALIESIN: Yes, you, the small one in the back.

226
00:15:32,939 --> 00:15:36,359
TRAVIS: Yeah, we have a silver ring with a little
blue gem on it.

227
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:37,859
LAURA: Can I have it?

228
00:15:37,859 --> 00:15:39,589
TRAVIS: Hold on a second!

229
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:40,670
LAURA: I like rings!

230
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:44,309
TRAVIS: Fucking pace yourself, all right? Yeah, I
know. The bling is going to come your way, all

231
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:48,670
right? We have a carved wand. Anybody have a wand
that's not carved?

232
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,668
SAM: Is it a stick?

233
00:15:49,668 --> 00:15:50,568
TRAVIS: It is.

234
00:15:50,568 --> 00:15:51,632
SAM: I like sticks.

235
00:15:51,632 --> 00:16:00,338
TRAVIS: Oh, shit. Well. Yeah. We got some chained
manacles, they're some big sons of bitches with a

236
00:16:00,338 --> 00:16:02,517
bunch of runes on the cuffs.

237
00:16:02,517 --> 00:16:04,260
LAURA: Ooh.

238
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,260
TALIESIN: I like manacles.

239
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:09,494
MARISHA: Who ended up grabbing the goggles? Did I
grab the goggles? I got them off the priest!

240
00:16:09,494 --> 00:16:10,562
MATT: You did, yes.

241
00:16:10,562 --> 00:16:12,142
MARISHA: I'm going to pull them out, take a look
at them.

242
00:16:12,142 --> 00:16:13,583
TALIESIN: Those are fancy.

243
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:19,882
MATT: The base of them is a soft leather that's
been cured and taken care of once you manage to

244
00:16:19,882 --> 00:16:27,653
wipe off some of the blood and soot from the
remains of the previous owner. It's a set of

245
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:34,030
goggles that can be comfortably placed over your
head, and the glass elements, or the lenses of them

246
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:37,573
have a bluish-purple sheen to them.

247
00:16:37,573 --> 00:16:40,015
MARISHA: I put them on.

248
00:16:40,015 --> 00:16:42,441
LIAM: Would you like to know what they are before
you put them on?

249
00:16:42,441 --> 00:16:48,733
MARISHA: Too late, man. It's like Thir13en Ghosts
(screams). No, I don't know.

250
00:16:48,733 --> 00:16:51,995
LAURA: What does it look like? Is it like a
kaleidoscope?

251
00:16:51,995 --> 00:16:56,485
MATT: When you place them over your eyes, because
immediately in the vicinity there's the few small

252
00:16:56,485 --> 00:17:01,176
bonfires people have gathered around, other than 
that, it's a dark night sky with stars peeking through the

253
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:05,487
elements of the clouds that have broken apart. It
looks like a cloudfront is still blowing in from

254
00:17:05,487 --> 00:17:09,227
the eastern side of the valley, but from what
little bit of the sky you can see, the stars are

255
00:17:09,227 --> 00:17:15,160
there. Upon placing the lenses over your eyes, you
have clear definition of all the nearby buildings,

256
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:20,288
the dark alleyways. You have a very clear
perspective on anything that is not directly being

257
00:17:20,288 --> 00:17:22,694
hit by firelight, and the firelight is almost a
little too bright.

258
00:17:22,694 --> 00:17:27,031
MARISHA: Holy shit, you guys. Is this what you can
see all the time?

259
00:17:27,031 --> 00:17:29,198
LAURA: I don't know, what does it look like?

260
00:17:29,198 --> 00:17:35,538
MARISHA: It's like I got night vision! Like I can
see... things!

261
00:17:35,538 --> 00:17:38,730
LIAM: Look over here. You look like a nerd.

262
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:43,906
MARISHA: I can deal with that, it's fine.

263
00:17:43,906 --> 00:17:46,820
TRAVIS: That's great. With you humans--

264
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,916
MARISHA: I can see shit!

265
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,566
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's real important. We were running
into problems--

266
00:17:49,566 --> 00:17:51,353
TALIESIN: I'm curious, can I try them on really
quick?

267
00:17:51,353 --> 00:17:54,073
LAURA: Do they fit over your--

268
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:58,278
TALIESIN: No, I got to unstrap them. I'm holding
them up--

269
00:17:58,278 --> 00:18:02,540
MATT: It tugs all of your horn jewelry and under
it in an uncomfortable way.

270
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,715
TRAVIS: Jingle jangle jingle jingle.

271
00:18:04,715 --> 00:18:06,357
MATT: No effect, actually.

272
00:18:06,357 --> 00:18:07,874
TALIESIN: Yeah, this is nothing.

273
00:18:07,874 --> 00:18:09,096
MARISHA: Lies.

274
00:18:09,096 --> 00:18:10,751
TRAVIS: Hey, Caleb.

275
00:18:10,751 --> 00:18:11,762
LIAM: Yeah?

276
00:18:11,762 --> 00:18:13,775
SAM: Can you see through my clothes?

277
00:18:13,775 --> 00:18:16,669
MARISHA: Do you want me to see through your
clothes?

278
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:17,734
SAM: No.

279
00:18:17,734 --> 00:18:19,045
MARISHA: Nah.

280
00:18:19,045 --> 00:18:22,757
TRAVIS: I remember you have an ability to
identify?

281
00:18:22,757 --> 00:18:28,264
LIAM: I don't have ability, I understand
certain magics. If you want me to explain what

282
00:18:28,264 --> 00:18:31,594
those things are before you try them willy-nilly,
yes, I can tell you--

283
00:18:31,594 --> 00:18:33,917
LAURA: Ooh, then look at the ring that I want!

284
00:18:33,917 --> 00:18:36,865
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure, yes.

285
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:37,997
LIAM: May I see it?

286
00:18:37,997 --> 00:18:40,443
TRAVIS: Absolutely. Here's the silver ring with
the blue gem.

287
00:18:40,443 --> 00:18:50,228
LIAM: Yeah. You know, I'm just going to check D&D
Beyond to see if I-- Yeah, I'm all tapped, but--

288
00:18:50,228 --> 00:18:54,424
SAM: Maybe you could just look at it and see with
your smarts.

289
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,741
LIAM: I will tell you something.

290
00:18:55,741 --> 00:18:56,821
TRAVIS: Motherfucker.

291
00:18:56,821 --> 00:18:58,297
LAURA: He totally just took the ring from--

292
00:18:58,297 --> 00:18:59,326
TRAVIS: I know!

293
00:18:59,326 --> 00:19:06,271
LIAM: I will tell you something: I don't need to
have this ring, I can tell you what it is.

294
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:08,573
MATT: Do you have Identify as a spell?

295
00:19:08,573 --> 00:19:18,188
LIAM: I do, but I need a pearl. I say to Fjord, I
need a somewhat valuable pearl, then I can do it

296
00:19:18,188 --> 00:19:23,667
all day long. I can know what anything is, even
though I am tired.

297
00:19:23,712 --> 00:19:26,834
LAURA: Ooh, do any of the rings that I have on my
fingers have a pearl on them?

298
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:28,761
SAM: How about the one that I stole from her?

299
00:19:28,761 --> 00:19:34,158
MATT: The ring that would have the pearl on it is
no longer on your hand, and the one that you have

300
00:19:34,158 --> 00:19:36,068
does have set into it a fairly nice pearl.

301
00:19:36,068 --> 00:19:38,731
LAURA: (gasps) You have a pearl!

302
00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:40,061
SAM: Would you--

303
00:19:40,061 --> 00:19:42,218
LIAM: Is that worth about a hundred gold pieces?

304
00:19:42,218 --> 00:19:43,482
MATT: You can certainly try.

305
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,080
LIAM: Oh, yes, let me-- Can I borrow this?

306
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,015
SAM: I want it back, though.

307
00:19:47,015 --> 00:19:54,965
LIAM: This is not instantaneous. Since I am so
tired, it takes me a little bit longer. I wedge

308
00:19:54,965 --> 00:19:57,509
out one of my books and I set it on the ground.

309
00:19:57,509 --> 00:19:59,154
MARISHA: Do you want to go to--

310
00:19:59,154 --> 00:20:03,202
TALIESIN: Instead of setting a book on the ground,
let's sit at a table at a pub or bar.

311
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,712
TRAVIS: We'll make sure you're not disturbed.

312
00:20:05,712 --> 00:20:09,406
LIAM: It's up to you. I haven't done this in a
while and I'm excited to do it. But I could hold

313
00:20:09,406 --> 00:20:10,463
off a little.

314
00:20:10,463 --> 00:20:12,025
TALIESIN: I require drink and lumbar support.

315
00:20:12,025 --> 00:20:14,654
LIAM: Okay, I take the book and I close it and
then I put it back.

316
00:20:14,654 --> 00:20:15,943
LAURA: Do you want me to carry it for you?

317
00:20:15,943 --> 00:20:20,115
LIAM: No, I have both the ring and the one that
Fjord gave me. So if it's good for you, you may

318
00:20:20,115 --> 00:20:24,063
have it. I'm more interested in executing
skill.

319
00:20:24,063 --> 00:20:28,875
TRAVIS: Okay, yeah. Molly, I need something from
you.

320
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:29,819
TALIESIN: Yes?

321
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:31,122
TRAVIS: Find us a fucking bar.

322
00:20:31,122 --> 00:20:32,106
TALIESIN: On it.

323
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:34,052
SAM: Should we just go to the Feed and Mead?

324
00:20:34,052 --> 00:20:36,105
LAURA: Let's do it!

325
00:20:36,105 --> 00:20:37,499
SAM: Or somewhere else?

326
00:20:37,499 --> 00:20:40,153
LAURA: I hope they have milk.

327
00:20:40,153 --> 00:20:42,564
TRAVIS: Because the Candleglow Inn is fucking
toast.

328
00:20:42,564 --> 00:20:47,886
TALIESIN: I'm going to just literally yell at the
top of my lungs in the middle of the crowd: I'm

329
00:20:47,886 --> 00:20:50,812
looking for the best pub in this bloody town!

330
00:20:50,812 --> 00:20:55,896
MATT: As soon as you finish screaming it, you turn
around and go face to face with Crute, the rather

331
00:20:55,896 --> 00:21:02,190
rough-looking dwarf who runs the Feed and Mead
where you guys have been staying. He goes, "Huh,

332
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:05,742
"that would be my place where you are staying."

333
00:21:05,742 --> 00:21:07,537
TALIESIN: Onward!

334
00:21:07,537 --> 00:21:13,863
MATT: Everyone around is like "Eh." But
he's already got your attention. He leads you guys

335
00:21:13,863 --> 00:21:18,496
back to the familiar Feed and Mead. Where has been
empty previously when you guys were staying there,

336
00:21:18,496 --> 00:21:21,608
now there seems to be a little bit of an air of
celebration. Since that is where you guys are

337
00:21:21,608 --> 00:21:25,251
going, other people are following and it seems the
party is going where you're going. As you enter

338
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:28,582
the place, Crute seems excited because now all of
a sudden there's a burst in clientele.

339
00:21:28,582 --> 00:21:29,695
TRAVIS: Pub crawl.

340
00:21:29,695 --> 00:21:32,550
SAM: There's only one pub.

341
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:40,164
MATT: As you begin to order your drinks, many of
the various villagers prevent you from paying. For

342
00:21:40,164 --> 00:21:42,341
the remainder of the evening, your drinks are on
the town of Alfield.

343
00:21:42,341 --> 00:21:45,577
TRAVIS: Very, very generous. Fucking drink up.

344
00:21:45,577 --> 00:21:51,530
LIAM: Before we even go into the building, I go
over to Nott and adjust the hood a little bit

345
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,754
further forward.

346
00:21:52,754 --> 00:21:53,906
SAM: Are my ears tucked back in?

347
00:21:53,906 --> 00:21:58,448
LIAM: The ears are in and make sure that the mask
is secure. Have fun.

348
00:21:58,448 --> 00:22:01,047
SAM: Okay. You're really all right, Caleb?

349
00:22:01,047 --> 00:22:03,228
LIAM: Yeah, I'm okay. It was a rough night.

350
00:22:03,228 --> 00:22:06,346
SAM: I know, but you went a bit catatonic.

351
00:22:06,346 --> 00:22:08,639
LIAM: I did.

352
00:22:08,639 --> 00:22:13,866
SAM: Did you see anything or have a vision? I
don't know.

353
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:16,905
LIAM: No, I did not see a vision. I saw a burning
person.

354
00:22:16,905 --> 00:22:19,488
SAM: All right. They were bad.

355
00:22:19,488 --> 00:22:23,144
LIAM: Let's go get a drink.

356
00:22:23,144 --> 00:22:24,469
SAM: All right.

357
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:29,734
TALIESIN: Anybody who tries to buy me a drink, I
slip a silver into their pocket. Let me know how

358
00:22:29,734 --> 00:22:31,298
low we get.

359
00:22:31,298 --> 00:22:40,150
MATT: Okay. They're common folk for the most part.
Nobody seems to notice. Those that even do watch

360
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:45,357
you aren't going to argue. Now, is that just
drinks on you?

361
00:22:45,357 --> 00:22:50,961
TALIESIN: When any time we let them buy us drinks,
I'm just going to put a silver in anybody's pocket

362
00:22:50,961 --> 00:22:52,692
who's buying us drinks.

363
00:22:52,692 --> 00:22:56,182
MATT: Okay, depending on how many rounds you guys
want, that'll put you down about two gold

364
00:22:56,182 --> 00:22:58,621
probably by the time the night is done.

365
00:22:58,621 --> 00:23:00,010
TALIESIN: Done.

366
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:05,374
SAM: I'm going to keep getting shots and pouring
them into my flask and going up and asking for another.

367
00:23:05,374 --> 00:23:13,421
MATT: Fair enough. Make it three gold (laughs).
Caleb, you're spending time--

368
00:23:13,421 --> 00:23:21,868
LIAM: I'm going to find a corner table in the
ruckus. I will take the ring with the pearl, and I

369
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:28,935
hold it right here. I pull out the other ring and
I look at it and I begin to focus and study the

370
00:23:28,935 --> 00:23:38,149
different angles of it and hope that I have a
pearl of enough value to make things happen.

371
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:42,055
LAURA: I'm going to sit next to Caleb and watch it
all happen.

372
00:23:42,055 --> 00:23:44,318
MATT: It is riveting.

373
00:23:44,318 --> 00:23:48,979
LAURA: Don't you need to pull out your book so you
can look at your spells?

374
00:23:48,979 --> 00:23:50,453
LIAM: It's already out.

375
00:23:50,453 --> 00:23:51,694
LAURA: Oh.

376
00:23:51,694 --> 00:23:57,562
LIAM: You know when you play D&D, you don't
narrate taking a pooper, but you can assume that

377
00:23:57,562 --> 00:23:59,474
the characters take a pooper every day.

378
00:23:59,474 --> 00:24:00,845
TRAVIS: (chagrined) I narrated it.

379
00:24:00,845 --> 00:24:02,434
LAURA: This is true.

380
00:24:02,434 --> 00:24:04,507
LIAM: Some things just happen.

381
00:24:04,507 --> 00:24:10,944
LAURA: While he's doing everything he's doing, I'm
going try to very subtly draw a dick in his book.

382
00:24:10,944 --> 00:24:13,803
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.

383
00:24:13,803 --> 00:24:16,050
SAM: (singing) It's a dick in a book.

384
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,173
LAURA: Natural 20!

385
00:24:18,173 --> 00:24:20,218
SAM: Natural dick 20.

386
00:24:20,218 --> 00:24:23,168
TALIESIN: 20 god damn dicks.

387
00:24:23,168 --> 00:24:28,133
MATT: Yes, the pearl is enough for you to focus on
the spell.

388
00:24:28,194 --> 00:24:29,378
LIAM: Yes!

389
00:24:29,378 --> 00:24:30,649
MATT: The ring.

390
00:24:30,649 --> 00:24:32,477
MARISHA: What is it?

391
00:24:32,477 --> 00:24:33,938
SAM: Is this our first item?

392
00:24:33,938 --> 00:24:35,122
MATT: And you know what this is.

393
00:24:35,122 --> 00:24:36,488
LAURA: It's our first item!

394
00:24:36,488 --> 00:24:38,018
LIAM: Oh.

395
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,288
LAURA: What is it, Caleb?

396
00:24:40,288 --> 00:24:46,604
LIAM: This is good. You may have it. I don't get
into water too much, as you could guess. This is

397
00:24:46,604 --> 00:24:54,109
good for walking yourself upon water. You take
this, as promised.

398
00:24:54,109 --> 00:24:56,184
MARISHA: That's rad.

399
00:24:56,184 --> 00:24:59,414
LAURA: You can stand on and move across any liquid
surface?

400
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:02,613
LIAM: Yeah, but also why is there a dickbutt in my
spellbook?

401
00:25:02,613 --> 00:25:05,876
LAURA: Where did that come from?

402
00:25:05,876 --> 00:25:09,492
LIAM: I don't know. Maybe it was Nott pulling a
prank on me.

403
00:25:09,492 --> 00:25:13,583
LAURA: Probably. It was probably Nott. Wow, this
ring is so cool!

404
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:19,041
TRAVIS: Hey, Caleb, are you exhausted from that
experience? We do have other items to--

405
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:23,954
LIAM: No, I don't need-- well, I do want one drink,
but I don't need a ton of drinks. This is my

406
00:25:23,954 --> 00:25:27,363
thing, so what else did we get?

407
00:25:27,363 --> 00:25:31,231
TRAVIS: We have a carved stick-- wand.

408
00:25:31,231 --> 00:25:33,540
LIAM: I will take the wand.

409
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,762
TRAVIS: Yup.

410
00:25:34,762 --> 00:25:36,189
LIAM: Thank you.

411
00:25:36,189 --> 00:25:40,390
TRAVIS: These big fucking chain manacles I've just got
over my shoulder.

412
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:46,332
LIAM: I need another ten minutes. Fjord, would you
get me a second whiskey? By the time you get back,

413
00:25:46,332 --> 00:25:49,100
maybe I will understand what this is.

414
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,481
TRAVIS: I ain't a fucking waitress.

415
00:25:50,481 --> 00:25:53,017
LIAM: Ten minutes later.

416
00:25:53,017 --> 00:25:55,377
MATT: Yep. Look at the majesty of this.

417
00:25:55,377 --> 00:25:59,040
LAURA: What is it?

418
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,981
TRAVIS: It's a wand of dickbutts.

419
00:26:00,981 --> 00:26:02,734
LAURA: How fortunate.

420
00:26:02,734 --> 00:26:07,584
LIAM: (sighs)

421
00:26:07,584 --> 00:26:09,431
LAURA: What is it?

422
00:26:09,431 --> 00:26:11,811
TRAVIS: That's the: Do I tell them or do I not?

423
00:26:11,811 --> 00:26:16,218
LAURA: What is it?!

424
00:26:16,218 --> 00:26:17,735
LIAM: It's fascinating.

425
00:26:17,735 --> 00:26:19,965
(laughter)

426
00:26:19,965 --> 00:26:24,116
LIAM: Oh. Do you know how to use wands?

427
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:25,503
LAURA: Of course I do.

428
00:26:25,503 --> 00:26:28,827
LIAM: Is she full of shit? What do I roll?

429
00:26:28,827 --> 00:26:30,180
MATT: Make an insight check.

430
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:35,068
LIAM: Yeah. I got a 15.

431
00:26:35,068 --> 00:26:36,639
MATT: She seems to be on the level.

432
00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:37,993
LAURA: Yeah, I'm on the level.

433
00:26:37,993 --> 00:26:40,785
LIAM : This is too dangerous for you to have. I'm
keeping this one--

434
00:26:40,785 --> 00:26:43,832
LAURA: No, just tell me what it is, Caleb!

435
00:26:43,832 --> 00:26:49,345
LIAM: No it's for me, I gave you the ring. That's
the deal. I promised it to you and now you have it.

436
00:26:49,345 --> 00:26:51,472
TALIESIN: What does the wand do?

437
00:26:51,472 --> 00:26:53,137
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was going to say, you can just
share.

438
00:26:53,137 --> 00:26:54,345
LAURA: You have to tell us.

439
00:26:54,345 --> 00:26:56,596
LIAM: If I tell you, you will try to steal it from
me.

440
00:26:56,596 --> 00:26:57,938
TRAVIS: No, I swear I won't.

441
00:26:57,938 --> 00:27:06,984
LAURA: Unless it's a wand that makes doughnuts or
pickles, then I probably won't try to steal it, probably.

442
00:27:06,984 --> 00:27:08,979
LIAM: No, it's too dangerous.

443
00:27:08,979 --> 00:27:10,466
(laughter)

444
00:27:10,466 --> 00:27:11,622
LAURA: No, Caleb!

445
00:27:11,622 --> 00:27:14,796
TALIESIN: I'm taking his drink away. You don't get
to drink.

446
00:27:14,796 --> 00:27:16,506
TRAVIS: Now it's definitely going to be stolen.

447
00:27:16,506 --> 00:27:21,527
We have one other item. Not that I don't
love my posture being corrected.

448
00:27:21,527 --> 00:27:22,969
MATT: You technically have two more.

449
00:27:22,969 --> 00:27:24,531
LIAM: Fine, do you want to know what it does?

450
00:27:24,531 --> 00:27:25,487
LAURA: Yes!

451
00:27:25,487 --> 00:27:27,053
LIAM: I will show you what it does.

452
00:27:27,053 --> 00:27:28,599
LAURA: What does it do? Wait, he's doing it!

453
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:29,996
SAM: Oh, he's casting the wand.

454
00:27:29,996 --> 00:27:32,152
LIAM: I point this stick at Jester.

455
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:35,122
MATT: Okay, make a-- is it a wisdom or charisma?

456
00:27:35,122 --> 00:27:38,056
LIAM: It is a charisma saving throw.

457
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,085
MATT: Charisma saving throw, please.

458
00:27:39,085 --> 00:27:41,505
LAURA: Ah, oh Jesus. Okay.

459
00:27:41,505 --> 00:27:43,072
TALIESIN: First party death.

460
00:27:43,072 --> 00:27:44,283
SAM: Insta-death.

461
00:27:44,283 --> 00:27:49,988
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. Oh, 12.

462
00:27:49,988 --> 00:27:52,030
LIAM: Oh, it's just a stick.

463
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,057
MATT: Yeah.

464
00:27:53,057 --> 00:27:54,173
LAURA: Oh, it didn't do anything?

465
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,592
LIAM: No. Told you.

466
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:59,253
LAURA: That's a very low DC, because I rolled
shit.

467
00:27:59,253 --> 00:28:00,464
LIAM: A low what?

468
00:28:00,464 --> 00:28:01,781
LAURA: A DC.

469
00:28:01,781 --> 00:28:05,893
Yeah, that's a nine, right? It's a nein!

470
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:07,550
SAM and MARISHA: Nein.

471
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,743
LAURA: Plus three.

472
00:28:08,743 --> 00:28:13,744
TRAVIS: How about these them there chain manacles?
So I can get my spine back in alignment.

473
00:28:13,744 --> 00:28:15,759
MARISHA: You look like you're into some shit.

474
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:20,000
LIAM: I promise you'll have these back because I cannot
lift them. Would you put them on the table for me?

475
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:21,101
TRAVIS: Yeah.

476
00:28:21,101 --> 00:28:22,580
MATT: (crash) Onto the table.

477
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,928
TRAVIS: They're fucking huge.

478
00:28:23,928 --> 00:28:25,380
LIAM: Hold the ring and wait.

479
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:32,445
MATT: You finish the spell. They are not magical.
They once were, and you can tell by the runes at

480
00:28:32,445 --> 00:28:38,954
the base of where the manacles clink together that
they were at some point sealed. Whatever

481
00:28:38,997 --> 00:28:41,109
enchantment was on them has been released.

482
00:28:41,171 --> 00:28:44,443
TRAVIS: Tell me they're super valuable. That was a
fucking bitch to lug around.

483
00:28:44,443 --> 00:28:50,711
LIAM: They are a very strange one. If you are
feeling gassy, they take away the cramps you feel.

484
00:28:50,711 --> 00:28:54,291
You have to wear them. It's extraneous, it's too
much.

485
00:28:54,291 --> 00:28:55,492
TRAVIS: Seems extreme.

486
00:28:55,492 --> 00:28:56,591
LIAM: It's overkill.

487
00:28:56,591 --> 00:28:58,456
TRAVIS: Yeah, all right. Well, mysterious wonders.

488
00:28:58,456 --> 00:29:00,398
LAURA: What kind of metal is it?

489
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:02,845
MARISHA: Yeah, I was going to say, it's a lot of
good metal. We can always sell it for scrap metal.

490
00:29:02,845 --> 00:29:04,053
LAURA: To the blacksmith.

491
00:29:04,053 --> 00:29:05,078
TRAVIS: I like that more.

492
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:06,233
MATT: There's also the glaive.

493
00:29:06,233 --> 00:29:08,957
LAURA: I have a glaive. Look at this glaive.

494
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:11,931
MARISHA: Didn't we get a pendant off of the
priest?

495
00:29:11,931 --> 00:29:13,525
MATT: No, there was a glove.

496
00:29:13,525 --> 00:29:15,793
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, the red glove!

497
00:29:15,793 --> 00:29:19,907
LIAM: These are shit. I slide them off the
table--

498
00:29:19,907 --> 00:29:24,920
MATT: (crash) Everyone who's near in the vicinity
all of a sudden turns as this loud, heavy clatter

499
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,247
of metal chains--

500
00:29:26,247 --> 00:29:29,998
TRAVIS: Sorry! No, we're just going through stuff.
Back to your drinks, everything's fine.

501
00:29:29,998 --> 00:29:32,781
LIAM: I want to do it again. What do we have? Give
me the thing.

502
00:29:32,781 --> 00:29:33,851
LAURA: A glaive.

503
00:29:33,851 --> 00:29:34,770
LIAM: Okay.

504
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:38,511
LAURA: Whoa!

505
00:29:38,511 --> 00:29:39,954
SAM: That's a big thing.

506
00:29:39,954 --> 00:29:41,914
LIAM: Yeah. Oh.

507
00:29:41,914 --> 00:29:45,574
LAURA: Is it too dangerous for me to have?

508
00:29:45,574 --> 00:29:46,744
SAM: It's too dangerous.

509
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:53,143
LIAM: No, this is great. It's very powerful. It
is a fine weapon. Probably better than anything--

510
00:29:53,143 --> 00:29:59,924
except maybe for your blade. Is anyone able to
use a glaive? I can't do anything with it.

511
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:01,608
LAURA: What is a glaive?

512
00:30:01,608 --> 00:30:08,630
MATT: A glaive is a polearm with a giant axe blade
at the top of it.

513
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,529
SAM: Beau could use it, right?

514
00:30:10,529 --> 00:30:13,297
MATT: It's not a monk weapon.

515
00:30:13,297 --> 00:30:15,209
LAURA: Is it something that I could use?

516
00:30:15,209 --> 00:30:16,496
MATT: It's a two-handed weapon, yeah.

517
00:30:16,496 --> 00:30:20,034
LAURA: Can I use a two-handed weapon? Oh, I have a
shield.

518
00:30:20,092 --> 00:30:23,145
MATT: You have a shield, you'd have to get rid of
your shield and I have go to see if you have the

519
00:30:23,145 --> 00:30:27,131
capability to even use it. Because I don't think
you know-- do you know simple weapons?

520
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:28,859
LAURA: Yes.

521
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:31,014
MATT: Let me double check real fast. As far as I
know--

522
00:30:31,014 --> 00:30:37,367
LAURA: I need to get a better weapon, though, you
guys. Because this sickle doesn't do much.

523
00:30:37,367 --> 00:30:38,786
TALIESIN: It's very pretty.

524
00:30:38,786 --> 00:30:44,632
LAURA: It's really cool-looking, right? That's why
got it. How's it balanced, is it good?

525
00:30:44,632 --> 00:30:45,680
TALIESIN: It's very nice.

526
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,340
MATT: Yeah, you aren't proficient with glaives,
unfortunately.

527
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,265
LAURA: No.

528
00:30:48,265 --> 00:30:51,463
LIAM: Do you know what this is? It is a very good
sale at a pawn shop.

529
00:30:51,463 --> 00:30:52,977
MARISHA: Yeah.

530
00:30:52,977 --> 00:30:54,468
SAM: None of us can use it?

531
00:30:54,468 --> 00:30:58,013
LAURA: Well, what does it do, because how much is
it worth?

532
00:30:58,013 --> 00:31:01,650
LIAM: Well, it's very painful if it hits you.

533
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:03,522
LAURA: Okay.

534
00:31:03,522 --> 00:31:04,581
LIAM: That's it.

535
00:31:04,581 --> 00:31:05,810
MARISHA: So it is magical?

536
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:11,211
LIAM: Most definitely it is magical, yes. Stronger
than your average glaive, that's what I am saying, yeah.

537
00:31:11,211 --> 00:31:12,352
TRAVIS: Great, yeah.

538
00:31:12,352 --> 00:31:18,709
MARISHA: I have a feeling that no one in this town
could afford it right now. But when we get to--

539
00:31:18,709 --> 00:31:20,974
LAURA: Zadash.

540
00:31:20,974 --> 00:31:25,876
MARISHA: Zadash. I might know a few contacts that
might want something.

541
00:31:25,876 --> 00:31:27,756
LIAM: You know people in Zadash?

542
00:31:27,756 --> 00:31:29,367
MARISHA: I know people everywhere.

543
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:33,457
LAURA: I'm writing magic glaive.

544
00:31:33,457 --> 00:31:36,474
SAM: Oh yeah, who's keeping stuff? Are you our
stuff keeper?

545
00:31:36,474 --> 00:31:38,055
TRAVIS: Who's got the oven mitt?

546
00:31:38,055 --> 00:31:41,386
LIAM: Who's got the monster calves to carry this?
There you go.

547
00:31:41,386 --> 00:31:42,848
LAURA: (grunts)

548
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,521
SAM: Oven mitt?

549
00:31:44,521 --> 00:31:46,987
LIAM: Here.

550
00:31:46,987 --> 00:31:50,204
TRAVIS: Red oven mitt, who's got it?

551
00:31:50,204 --> 00:31:51,402
SAM and LAURA: I don't know.

552
00:31:51,402 --> 00:31:53,427
TALIESIN: Who had the red oven mitt?

553
00:31:53,427 --> 00:31:54,693
MARISHA: Was it on the priest?

554
00:31:54,693 --> 00:31:55,491
MATT: It was on the priest.

555
00:31:55,491 --> 00:31:56,907
MARISHA: I have it. I got it.

556
00:31:56,907 --> 00:31:58,481
TRAVIS: I'm looking at you while I say it the
whole time.

557
00:31:58,481 --> 00:32:02,281
MARISHA: I've got my goggles on and I'm just
like--

558
00:32:02,281 --> 00:32:05,102
TRAVIS: I grab the nose piece and go (fwoosh)
(impact).

559
00:32:05,102 --> 00:32:06,096
MARISHA: Ah!

560
00:32:06,096 --> 00:32:08,094
(laughter)

561
00:32:08,094 --> 00:32:10,138
MARISHA: I just punch him in the shoulder really
hard.

562
00:32:10,138 --> 00:32:11,837
TRAVIS: (pained) Yeah, ah.

563
00:32:11,837 --> 00:32:15,267
MATT: Yeah, your left arm goes numb for a while.

564
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,931
MARISHA: I pull out the oven mitt.

565
00:32:17,931 --> 00:32:24,098
LIAM: Oh my goodness, yeah. Like 45 minutes have
gone by looking at all these things.

566
00:32:24,098 --> 00:32:26,945
MATT: You guys have all grown steadily more
intoxicated.

567
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,189
LAURA: Not me, because I drink milk.

568
00:32:29,189 --> 00:32:30,380
MATT: That's right.

569
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:34,821
SAM: And not me, because I've just been getting
them and pouring them.

570
00:32:34,821 --> 00:32:45,671
LAURA: What is it? Can you shoot fire from your
hands? Can you shoot lightning from your hands?

571
00:32:45,671 --> 00:32:47,797
Can you catch things really well?

572
00:32:47,797 --> 00:32:49,769
TALIESIN: Does it make a very good macaroni and
cheese?

573
00:32:49,769 --> 00:32:51,307
LIAM: He just puts it away.

574
00:32:51,307 --> 00:32:56,857
LAURA: I don't like Caleb looking at our shit
anymore. He just looks at it and steals it.

575
00:32:56,857 --> 00:32:59,953
LIAM: He puts the wand down in front of Jester.

576
00:32:59,953 --> 00:33:01,164
LAURA: (gasps)

577
00:33:01,164 --> 00:33:06,472
MARISHA: What's with the oven mitt?

578
00:33:06,472 --> 00:33:08,930
LIAM: It just hurts people.

579
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,984
SAM: This is the wand, this is just it?

580
00:33:10,984 --> 00:33:12,166
LAURA: This is so cute.

581
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:14,845
MARISHA: Wait, it hurts people so you're going to
hang onto it?

582
00:33:14,845 --> 00:33:16,745
LAURA: This is a great wand.

583
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:19,028
LIAM: Do you know how to use arcane artifacts?

584
00:33:19,028 --> 00:33:24,165
MARISHA: It doesn't matter if I know how to use
arcane artifacts. Stuff that hurts people could

585
00:33:24,165 --> 00:33:28,522
still be beneficial to our cause, because other
people want to hurt us.

586
00:33:28,522 --> 00:33:34,320
TRAVIS: I mean, she has a point. I know how to use
arcane artifacts.

587
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,410
MARISHA: Yeah, why don't you see if Fjord wants
it?

588
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:39,080
LAURA: I point the wand at Nott.

589
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,750
SAM: I rolled a four.

590
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,493
LAURA: (laughs)

591
00:33:44,493 --> 00:33:48,041
MATT: You watch from beneath the mask--

592
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:50,500
LAURA: I pull the mask down.

593
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:55,860
MATT: The edges of the toothy goblin grin curl
into this uncontrollable smile that threatens to

594
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,695
crack the sides of her face.

595
00:33:57,695 --> 00:34:00,623
LAURA: Oh my goodness. That's really creepy, Nott.

596
00:34:00,623 --> 00:34:03,089
SAM: I can't stop!

597
00:34:03,089 --> 00:34:04,362
LAURA: How do I make it stop?

598
00:34:04,362 --> 00:34:06,128
SAM: I don't know, dear gods!

599
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:08,816
TALIESIN: Nott, why so serious?

600
00:34:08,816 --> 00:34:10,258
SAM: It hurts!

601
00:34:10,258 --> 00:34:12,646
LAURA: I think it lasts for a while.

602
00:34:12,646 --> 00:34:17,046
SAM: Oh gods! It's painful!

603
00:34:17,046 --> 00:34:25,918
MATT: At this point, these two young farm boys,
that were in there drinking in the back and watching,

604
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:32,056
listening in, are just staring at Nott and backing away
slowly to the back of the room. "We got to go."

605
00:34:32,056 --> 00:34:33,385
SAM: It's okay.

606
00:34:33,385 --> 00:34:38,136
MATT: "We got to go!" They leave the room and
everyone else just looking over. Yeah, it's caused

607
00:34:38,136 --> 00:34:39,788
a bit of a scene.

608
00:34:39,788 --> 00:34:41,030
SAM: The Wand of Smiles.

609
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:46,129
LAURA: Yes it's a Wand of Smiles. They have to
roll a DC of ten for charisma saving throw or be

610
00:34:46,129 --> 00:34:47,946
forced to smile for a minute.

611
00:34:47,946 --> 00:34:50,695
TRAVIS: Yes, awesome.

612
00:34:50,695 --> 00:34:53,025
LAURA: That's the cutest fucking wand!

613
00:34:53,025 --> 00:34:55,316
SAM: Love it.

614
00:34:55,316 --> 00:34:56,567
LAURA: I love it.

615
00:34:56,567 --> 00:34:58,104
MARISHA: I wonder if it works on animals.

616
00:34:58,104 --> 00:35:02,364
LAURA: We'll find out. Where's-- oh, Frumpkin.

617
00:35:02,364 --> 00:35:03,876
LIAM: What?

618
00:35:03,876 --> 00:35:05,428
LAURA: Frumpkin's gone.

619
00:35:05,428 --> 00:35:08,074
LIAM: He's not gone. He's always with me and he
will be back tomorrow.

620
00:35:08,074 --> 00:35:09,117
LAURA: Okay.

621
00:35:09,117 --> 00:35:10,898
MARISHA: Back to the glove thing, though.

622
00:35:10,898 --> 00:35:17,276
LIAM: Yeah. It burns people like I burned that
man.

623
00:35:17,276 --> 00:35:18,485
TRAVIS: Oh.

624
00:35:18,485 --> 00:35:22,036
LAURA: Oh. Well, you don't want to keep it. You
hate burning people.

625
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,125
MARISHA: Exactly.

626
00:35:23,125 --> 00:35:24,446
TRAVIS: That could come in very handy.

627
00:35:24,446 --> 00:35:31,133
MARISHA: It's not fair for you to put your issues
onto literal inanimate objects.

628
00:35:31,133 --> 00:35:33,595
LIAM: Would you like to trade your goggles for
them?

629
00:35:33,595 --> 00:35:40,920
MARISHA: No. I can't use arcane shit. But he can.

630
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,347
LIAM: You have that very fancy sword you have.

631
00:35:44,347 --> 00:35:47,964
TRAVIS: Yeah. But sometimes you need batting
gloves.

632
00:35:47,964 --> 00:35:50,094
LIAM: Does it mean that much to you? Would you
like it?

633
00:35:50,094 --> 00:35:52,206
TRAVIS: I would like to see it.

634
00:35:52,206 --> 00:35:54,367
LIAM: Okay. Here it is.

635
00:35:54,367 --> 00:36:02,771
TRAVIS: Yep. Hold on. That's a fucking glove of
fire.

636
00:36:02,771 --> 00:36:04,944
TALIESIN: Do your thing.

637
00:36:04,944 --> 00:36:06,848
LAURA: You have to stick it on your forehead.

638
00:36:06,848 --> 00:36:08,601
MATT: Does it require attunement?

639
00:36:08,601 --> 00:36:14,362
LIAM: I don't know. No. He's good.

640
00:36:14,362 --> 00:36:18,611
MATT: After putting it on, you would actually know
the properties of it.

641
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:21,836
TRAVIS: Oh, sweet! What are the properties of it?

642
00:36:21,836 --> 00:36:24,430
MARISHA: Give him the damn paper.

643
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:28,443
LIAM: I don't move at the speed of your thought.

644
00:36:28,443 --> 00:36:33,793
TRAVIS: Okay. Cool. Yeah.

645
00:36:33,793 --> 00:36:35,199
LAURA: What does it do?

646
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:39,211
TRAVIS: It's a Scorching Ray spell. A little plus
five.

647
00:36:39,211 --> 00:36:47,304
LIAM: I'm sorry that I kept it for myself. Enjoy.
I will not take any of the spoils of anything we

648
00:36:47,304 --> 00:36:49,200
find anywhere. Enjoy.

649
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:56,235
MARISHA: Okay, you didn't frame it that way,
though. You put it under the guise of this is bad,

650
00:36:56,235 --> 00:36:57,670
this hurts people.

651
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:01,266
LIAM: It does hurt people. You seem very angry at
me right now.

652
00:37:01,266 --> 00:37:02,914
MARISHA: I'm just wondering what your deal is.

653
00:37:02,914 --> 00:37:08,956
LAURA: Look. This ring is perfect for you. That
way if we get near water you don't go in it.

654
00:37:08,956 --> 00:37:21,487
LIAM: I'm slowly, ever so slowly beginning to like
you, so please don't fuck it up.

655
00:37:21,487 --> 00:37:30,599
SAM: I think that we should all say thank you to
Caleb for identifying our objects.

656
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:33,101
LAURA: Cheers to Caleb!

657
00:37:33,101 --> 00:37:37,334
MARISHA: Yeah. That's not the issue. But cheers!

658
00:37:37,334 --> 00:37:40,553
LIAM: This is what people do.

659
00:37:40,553 --> 00:37:45,531
TRAVIS: And Nott, may I say thank you for saving
my life, because I was in a fucking pickle in there

660
00:37:45,531 --> 00:37:51,684
and if you hadn't gone and slaughtered that little
baby manticore, I'd have been fucked. So thank you.

661
00:37:51,684 --> 00:37:53,622
SAM: You're welcome.

662
00:37:53,622 --> 00:37:55,790
LAURA: Thank you, Fjord, for saving my life.

663
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:59,155
TRAVIS: Did I save your life?

664
00:37:59,155 --> 00:38:00,847
LAURA: Didn't you give me a potion?

665
00:38:00,847 --> 00:38:03,272
TRAVIS: I did. Yeah. That's right.

666
00:38:03,272 --> 00:38:09,807
LAURA: I woke up and you were over me giving me a
potion like a knight in shining armor.

667
00:38:09,807 --> 00:38:14,866
TRAVIS: Yeah. You're right. It was my pleasure.
You would have done it for me.

668
00:38:14,866 --> 00:38:19,549
LAURA: I probably would have. Probably. I did do
it for you though, Nott.

669
00:38:19,549 --> 00:38:21,433
SAM: Did you save me?

670
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:23,496
LAURA: I saved your life!

671
00:38:23,496 --> 00:38:24,729
SAM: Thank you.

672
00:38:24,729 --> 00:38:26,119
LIAM: Is she still smiling?

673
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:27,747
MATT: No. It's faded by now.

674
00:38:27,747 --> 00:38:32,671
LAURA: I hold the wand under the table at Caleb's
leg and try to do it to him too.

675
00:38:32,671 --> 00:38:35,088
MATT: Make a charisma saving throw.

676
00:38:35,088 --> 00:38:36,492
LIAM: It's constitution though, isn't it?

677
00:38:36,492 --> 00:38:41,155
LAURA: It's charisma. You had me do charisma.

678
00:38:41,155 --> 00:38:42,792
LIAM: I said constitution to you.

679
00:38:42,792 --> 00:38:44,100
MATT: She did charisma.

680
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:48,089
LIAM: Okay. I'm sure I'll fail it. 15.

681
00:38:48,089 --> 00:38:50,529
LAURA: You succeeded, but you didn't even know I
tried.

682
00:38:50,529 --> 00:38:59,943
MATT: As you guys finish your cheer, everyone else
in the room also lifts their drinks. "Hurrah!" They all

683
00:38:59,943 --> 00:39:01,537
give a cheer as well.

684
00:39:01,537 --> 00:39:02,571
MARISHA: Huzzah.

685
00:39:02,571 --> 00:39:04,677
ALL: Huzzah!

686
00:39:04,677 --> 00:39:11,118
MATT: As the evening continues, some folks come up
and tell their stories to you, give you thanks.

687
00:39:11,118 --> 00:39:17,065
Share a drink if someone was lost. Some recovered,
some not. Overall, everyone seems to be very appreciative.

688
00:39:17,065 --> 00:39:24,001
Eventually, whether through just general
exhaustion or imbibement, you bring yourself to

689
00:39:24,001 --> 00:39:29,796
rest, finding yourselves back to the singular room
you've all been sharing here at the Feed and Mead.

690
00:39:29,796 --> 00:39:34,009
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. Should we get another room
now that we've got some extra coin?

691
00:39:34,009 --> 00:39:35,914
MARISHA: How many rooms do they have at the
inn?

692
00:39:35,993 --> 00:39:37,064
MATT: Three.

693
00:39:37,064 --> 00:39:38,033
TRAVIS: Oh!

694
00:39:38,033 --> 00:39:40,287
MATT: It's not a big place.

695
00:39:40,287 --> 00:39:41,237
SAM: Are they vacant?

696
00:39:41,237 --> 00:39:44,077
MATT: At the moment? Yes.

697
00:39:44,077 --> 00:39:46,406
TRAVIS: We can get an extra room.

698
00:39:46,406 --> 00:39:47,799
MARISHA: Let's buy them all out.

699
00:39:47,799 --> 00:39:50,648
TRAVIS: Whoa! Hey, big spender! What?

700
00:39:50,648 --> 00:39:53,559
MARISHA: I'll take my own room if y'all don't want
in.

701
00:39:53,623 --> 00:39:56,186
LAURA: But we have always been roommates.

702
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:57,930
MARISHA: Then come join me, girl!

703
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:58,952
LAURA: Okay.

704
00:39:58,952 --> 00:40:07,010
MATT: Crute, while he has been happy to provide
you the evenings free for two rooms, even for all

705
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:16,966
you've done, "I am a businessman, through and
through, so I'll give you a discount. Three silver."

706
00:40:16,966 --> 00:40:18,928
MARISHA: Done.

707
00:40:18,928 --> 00:40:20,687
MATT: (laughs)

708
00:40:20,687 --> 00:40:28,452
LAURA: Matt's totally taking advantage of the fact
that none of us are hagglers this game. It's hard.

709
00:40:28,452 --> 00:40:30,027
It's really hard.

710
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:33,115
TRAVIS: Craft fair Laura is dying.

711
00:40:33,115 --> 00:40:38,986
LIAM: I will also pay for a room for Nott and
Caleb.

712
00:40:38,986 --> 00:40:43,487
MATT: "Of course. Then that will be also three
silver."

713
00:40:43,487 --> 00:40:49,172
LIAM: Wait did you just, ja? Did you pay for
everybody or for you?

714
00:40:49,172 --> 00:40:54,910
MARISHA: I paid for me. Here, for giving you shit
earlier. I give three silver.

715
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:59,274
MATT: "Thank you." (laughs) You have your own room
now.

716
00:40:59,274 --> 00:41:03,337
LAURA: Totally obvious that he's fucking us over.
(imitates Crute's laugh)

717
00:41:03,337 --> 00:41:05,013
LIAM: Danke.

718
00:41:05,013 --> 00:41:10,071
TALIESIN: Today has been the most profitable day
in my life. I have never seen so much money cross

719
00:41:10,071 --> 00:41:11,148
my path.

720
00:41:11,148 --> 00:41:14,536
LAURA: More money will come tomorrow because we
are selling the ears tomorrow!

721
00:41:14,536 --> 00:41:15,973
TALIESIN: This is ridiculous.

722
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,078
LAURA: Yeah!

723
00:41:17,078 --> 00:41:20,274
SAM: Where are the ears? Someone has them safe.

724
00:41:20,274 --> 00:41:22,780
LAURA: Of course, yeah, I have the ears right here
in this pickle jar.

725
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:26,279
SAM: Maybe it should be in Caleb and I's room
because we'll have the alarm to protect us.

726
00:41:26,279 --> 00:41:30,534
LAURA: No, I have them, it's okay.

727
00:41:30,534 --> 00:41:32,339
TALIESIN: Is somebody just going to show up and
say I--

728
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:36,938
LAURA: Like who wants pickled ears really, except
for me?

729
00:41:36,938 --> 00:41:38,386
SAM: All right.

730
00:41:38,386 --> 00:41:41,090
LIAM: I'm going to go get my cat! I go up.

731
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:43,827
LAURA: I'm going to go eat some pickled ears!

732
00:41:43,827 --> 00:41:45,838
TALIESIN: I'm going to watch this.

733
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:48,912
MATT: Do you actually partake in pickled ears?

734
00:41:48,912 --> 00:41:54,434
LAURA: No, I don't. I go upstairs and I'm
conversing with the Traveler.

735
00:41:54,434 --> 00:41:56,205
TALIESIN: Oh, you're going to do your thing.

736
00:41:56,272 --> 00:41:57,694
MARISHA: I go up and head up to the room as well.

737
00:41:57,694 --> 00:42:00,946
LAURA: I'm going to doodle and talk to the
Traveler.

738
00:42:00,946 --> 00:42:06,190
MATT: You all find yourselves going about what
final business you have for the evening before

739
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,324
rest takes you. You are doing your--

740
00:42:08,324 --> 00:42:14,170
LIAM: Well, I first take out the silver thread and
I cross it across the door and if there's any

741
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:22,095
windows there, I do the same and allow for Nott to
enter and leave. Then I draw patterns along the

742
00:42:22,095 --> 00:42:27,388
floor that spread up onto the table as well and
back down onto the floor. I squat with my book

743
00:42:27,388 --> 00:42:33,730
since I am tapped and I begin to bring back my
cat. An hour and ten minutes later, I don't know

744
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:39,568
if they're asleep or not, I have this cat named
Frumpkin and I wear him like a scarf.

745
00:42:39,568 --> 00:42:48,218
MATT: You watch as you finish the incantation and
the ritual comes to a complete cycle, in the

746
00:42:48,218 --> 00:42:54,500
center of where you made these markers across the
table you hear this slight tearing sound and there

747
00:42:54,500 --> 00:43:01,876
is this slight ripple in the air right in front of
you in the center of this and it's almost like a

748
00:43:01,876 --> 00:43:10,093
slight little tear in reality almost. From that,
Frumpkin steps out and lands, looks up at you.

749
00:43:10,093 --> 00:43:11,842
(meows)

750
00:43:11,842 --> 00:43:13,119
LIAM: Come here, I promise--

751
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:14,609
MATT: Immediately leaps up into your hands.

752
00:43:14,609 --> 00:43:20,298
LIAM: I promise not to do that too often. I just
scritch, for a long time.

753
00:43:20,298 --> 00:43:24,397
MATT: He purrs against you.

754
00:43:24,397 --> 00:43:30,348
MARISHA: He can't even hear about it!

755
00:43:30,348 --> 00:43:44,679
LAURA: Can I draw the general gnoll peeing on a
little fire hydrant and the rest of the gnolls

756
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:47,474
behind him fighting over a bone?

757
00:43:47,474 --> 00:43:50,613
MATT: Easy enough to do.

758
00:43:50,613 --> 00:44:03,094
LAURA: Then I'm going to draw the cutest baby
manticore you've ever seen and it's dead! I'm going

759
00:44:03,094 --> 00:44:09,534
to tell the Traveler: You know, I don't know
what's going on. I'm just hoping that you're here

760
00:44:09,534 --> 00:44:16,164
because this is the farthest I've ever gone and
I'm afraid that you can't hear me anymore and it's

761
00:44:16,164 --> 00:44:25,787
freaking me out a little bit. Because I know that
I'm around a bunch of people now and I haven't

762
00:44:25,787 --> 00:44:32,203
been before, but I want you to know that you're
still my best friend and if you want me to be

763
00:44:32,203 --> 00:44:35,931
alone I will be if that means that you'll be here.

764
00:44:35,931 --> 00:44:40,056
MARISHA: Beau just reaches over and hands her a
kleenex.

765
00:44:40,056 --> 00:44:47,178
LAURA: Thank you. Okay, that's all, good night.
What?

766
00:44:47,178 --> 00:44:50,073
MARISHA: Nothing.

767
00:44:50,073 --> 00:44:51,903
LAURA: Did you hear that?

768
00:44:51,903 --> 00:44:55,796
MARISHA: I'm in the room with you.

769
00:44:55,796 --> 00:44:58,015
LAURA: Oh. Right.

770
00:44:58,015 --> 00:45:04,076
MARISHA: I'm reading. While she was doing that,
I'm opening the letters from the Baumbauchs.

771
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:06,361
MATT: Oh! Right.

772
00:45:06,361 --> 00:45:08,519
TRAVIS and LAURA: Oh shit.

773
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:13,260
MATT: Well, finishing up with you. As you finish
that and lay down, you lay on one side, staring

774
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:19,555
towards the wall in this moment of quiet. You feel
this strange warmth and you look down underneath

775
00:45:19,555 --> 00:45:26,386
your robes and there you have the symbol of the
Traveler that you keep on yourself, the door arch

776
00:45:26,386 --> 00:45:35,565
and path, and it's warm to the touch, warmer than
your skin is. The subtle sensation of familiar

777
00:45:35,565 --> 00:45:44,754
closeness comes over you, and wordless, but an
emotion washes through your brain that's alien,

778
00:45:44,754 --> 00:45:50,150
from the outside of your own thoughts that just
says, "I'm with you."

779
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:55,471
LAURA: I take the symbol and I hold it up to my
cheek and I go to sleep.

780
00:45:55,471 --> 00:46:04,406
MATT: Okay. You start going through. There were four
letters clustered in here. You tear through the

781
00:46:04,406 --> 00:46:14,804
first one and look at it and it looks like it's a
shipment ledger up by Nogvurot. Nogvurot, it's a

782
00:46:14,804 --> 00:46:21,638
city on the northern end of the empire. It's just
an information ledger about shipments received,

783
00:46:21,638 --> 00:46:29,016
confirming payment and distribution to which
taverns are receiving it, and then asking for the

784
00:46:29,016 --> 00:46:36,221
next shipment. The second one that you open is
another ledger, this one comes from Deastok to the

785
00:46:36,221 --> 00:46:44,164
west. This one's cheaper, it's a smaller ledger.
The third one you open up, and it's a complaint--

786
00:46:44,164 --> 00:46:49,219
MARISHA: (kissing sounds) What is it?

787
00:46:49,219 --> 00:47:02,382
MATT: From Rexxentrum. It's titled by-- it
doesn't have the name but it says "The purveyor of

788
00:47:02,382 --> 00:47:10,697
the Rotted Stump", which is apparently some sort of
bar or tavern saying, "To the Baumbauch family: I

789
00:47:10,697 --> 00:47:16,573
"would happily request that if you are to send the
aforementioned and already paid shipments to our

790
00:47:16,573 --> 00:47:21,977
"establishment that they would not be containing
any sort of animals of which could chew through

791
00:47:21,977 --> 00:47:27,375
"and ruin and spoil the shipments you've been
given. We request an immediate refund." It shows a

792
00:47:27,375 --> 00:47:31,144
copy of a deal that was made. It's just an open
complaint.

793
00:47:31,144 --> 00:47:32,831
MARISHA: Nice.

794
00:47:32,831 --> 00:47:42,602
MATT: The fourth one's a little interesting. It's
just titled: To Demedan Baumbauch. Specifically.

795
00:47:42,602 --> 00:47:49,654
ALL: Demedan! Ooh!

796
00:47:49,654 --> 00:47:52,946
LIAM: I'm sure that one's not important.

797
00:47:52,946 --> 00:47:55,503
SAM: It's mostly about mayonnaise.

798
00:47:55,503 --> 00:48:01,172
LAURA: He's totally looking!

799
00:48:01,172 --> 00:48:03,619
LIAM: I know.

800
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:07,130
TALIESIN: Dear Mr. Mayo. We relish the time we've
had together.

801
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:12,334
MARISHA: Would I recognize what this word means?

802
00:48:12,334 --> 00:48:15,502
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

803
00:48:15,502 --> 00:48:22,163
MARISHA: Do I get any time of advantage for being
a shifty person?

804
00:48:22,163 --> 00:48:24,917
MATT: No, because this would be an investigation
check specifically, not an intelligence, it would

805
00:48:24,917 --> 00:48:27,948
be an investigation.

806
00:48:27,948 --> 00:48:33,900
MARISHA: Is this a code? Is this backwards? This
is backwards, isn't it? Fuck balls.

807
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,503
TALIESIN: You don't know.

808
00:48:35,503 --> 00:48:38,326
MARISHA: Eight.

809
00:48:38,326 --> 00:48:41,552
MATT: Eight. Well. You're just going to have to
figure it out on your own.

810
00:48:41,552 --> 00:48:44,063
LIAM: (singing) Fuck balls.

811
00:48:44,063 --> 00:48:50,513
MARISHA: Toordolbo.

812
00:48:50,513 --> 00:48:52,857
SAM: We'll come back to you.

813
00:48:52,857 --> 00:48:56,446
MARISHA: Do I know what the Evening Nip is? Do I
recognize that?

814
00:48:56,446 --> 00:48:58,346
MATT: You don't, actually.

815
00:48:58,346 --> 00:49:02,434
TRAVIS: You don't know the old evening nip?

816
00:49:02,434 --> 00:49:06,745
(laughter)

817
00:49:06,745 --> 00:49:13,752
MARISHA: I finish reading everything, I go over to
a sleeping Jester, pull her blankets up and tuck

818
00:49:13,752 --> 00:49:15,638
her in a little bit, and then I crash out.

819
00:49:15,638 --> 00:49:17,311
MATT: Okay.

820
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:24,121
SAM: Two quick things. One, I'd like to ask Caleb,
when he's done with his insanely long ritual: That

821
00:49:24,121 --> 00:49:27,786
pouch that I gave you, what was in it?

822
00:49:27,786 --> 00:49:29,979
LIAM: Did you give me a pouch?

823
00:49:29,979 --> 00:49:35,728
SAM: Oh, I gave you a pouch before. You might not
have felt it, but it's in your back pocket.

824
00:49:35,728 --> 00:49:38,162
LIAM: When did you do that?

825
00:49:38,162 --> 00:49:39,986
SAM: Before?

826
00:49:39,986 --> 00:49:42,648
LIAM: Oh, what is in it? Let's see.

827
00:49:42,648 --> 00:49:44,791
MATT: Which pouch is this?

828
00:49:44,791 --> 00:49:46,027
LAURA: Shakäste's.

829
00:49:46,027 --> 00:49:53,051
MATT: Oh, Shakäste's pouch. You find what is
roughly a handful of bird seed.

830
00:49:53,051 --> 00:49:58,854
LAURA: Wouldn't it be funny if there was, like, two
copper and a bunch of bird seed?

831
00:49:58,854 --> 00:50:05,587
MATT: Well, it's a heavy pouch and contains about
113 gold pieces.

832
00:50:05,587 --> 00:50:07,571
ALL: Whoa!

833
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:12,332
LAURA: Shakäste was fucking loaded!

834
00:50:12,332 --> 00:50:13,578
LIAM: One...

835
00:50:13,578 --> 00:50:14,692
LAURA: Oh jeez.

836
00:50:14,692 --> 00:50:15,939
LIAM: Two...

837
00:50:15,939 --> 00:50:17,882
TALIESIN: No long rest for you.

838
00:50:17,882 --> 00:50:20,713
LIAM: And then ten minutes later--

839
00:50:20,713 --> 00:50:28,498
MATT: There's some dried jerky and hide in there,
just for trail snacks. It seemed like a half road

840
00:50:28,498 --> 00:50:33,825
travel pack that Shakäste was keeping with him and
whatever coin he had brought with him on the journey.

841
00:50:33,825 --> 00:50:36,581
LAURA: You stole an old blind man's food and
money.

842
00:50:36,581 --> 00:50:38,363
SAM: I am the best.

843
00:50:38,363 --> 00:50:41,535
LIAM: Did you say 113?

844
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,924
MATT: 113.

845
00:50:42,924 --> 00:50:52,201
LIAM: Okay, so after counting it all, I separate
it and I put some jerky down-- go, have it-- to

846
00:50:52,201 --> 00:50:59,832
Frumpkin, and I push 60 gold across the floor.
Come here.

847
00:50:59,832 --> 00:51:03,828
SAM: Yes. Ow!

848
00:51:03,828 --> 00:51:09,011
TRAVIS: That was five of them.

849
00:51:09,011 --> 00:51:11,841
SAM: No, that's good, because my muscles are sore
from smiling before.

850
00:51:11,841 --> 00:51:14,978
MATT: It does help a little.

851
00:51:14,978 --> 00:51:19,604
SAM: Then I'm going to try to make acid while he
was doing his thing.

852
00:51:19,604 --> 00:51:25,733
MATT: Go ahead and make an alchemy supplies check.
Roll that plus your proficiency bonus and your

853
00:51:25,733 --> 00:51:26,779
intelligence.

854
00:51:26,779 --> 00:51:28,080
SAM: 19, plus things.

855
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:36,435
MATT: It will take you through the night and part
of the morning to do it. With a full night's

856
00:51:36,435 --> 00:51:42,966
sleep-- a full rest-- if you start early enough in
the night, by about noon tomorrow you'd be done.

857
00:51:42,966 --> 00:51:44,136
SAM: All right.

858
00:51:44,136 --> 00:51:46,207
MATT: Throughout that, you manage to create a vial
of acid.

859
00:51:46,207 --> 00:51:47,457
SAM: Awesome.

860
00:51:47,457 --> 00:51:54,698
LIAM: I have a question: the metal on the ring
with the pearl in it, what is it made of? Can I tell?

861
00:51:54,698 --> 00:52:02,880
MATT: Looking at it, it looks like the base
material for the pearl set in, it's a polished brass

862
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:09,645
that has been treated to look like gold, but some
of that treatment is rubbing off and you can see

863
00:52:09,645 --> 00:52:11,515
the duller brass color beneath.

864
00:52:11,515 --> 00:52:16,505
LIAM: I cannot remember, but Caleb can because of
Keen Mind. Brass: is that part of the alchemy that

865
00:52:16,505 --> 00:52:18,024
I can do?

866
00:52:18,024 --> 00:52:23,464
MATT: I will look. As far as your school of
transmutation?

867
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:25,132
LIAM: Yeah, that is correct.

868
00:52:25,132 --> 00:52:26,289
SAM: You have copper and silver for sure.

869
00:52:26,289 --> 00:52:28,112
LIAM: Copper, silver, wood.

870
00:52:28,112 --> 00:52:30,295
SAM: Iron?

871
00:52:30,295 --> 00:52:33,170
LIAM: I just can't remember if it is. Do we have a
Player's Handbook?

872
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:35,082
MATT: Wood, stone, iron, copper, or silver.

873
00:52:35,082 --> 00:52:41,418
LIAM: Brass is not on it, okay. Then I'm going to
spend the last 30 minutes before bed trying to

874
00:52:41,418 --> 00:52:46,388
slowly wedge the pearl out of the ring. I don't
want the ring.

875
00:52:46,388 --> 00:52:49,224
MATT: Okay, make a general strength check.

876
00:52:49,224 --> 00:52:54,610
LAURA: The pearl pops out and flies across
the room, never to be found again.

877
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:55,742
LIAM: 15.

878
00:52:55,742 --> 00:52:59,849
MATT: 15? It doesn't take you too long. Working on
it back and forth you eventually have enough give

879
00:52:59,849 --> 00:53:05,456
where the four claws that hold the pearl into the
ring set eventually give way and it pops out. It

880
00:53:05,456 --> 00:53:08,304
does hit the ground and roll and you quickly catch
up to it and grab it.

881
00:53:08,304 --> 00:53:09,644
SAM: It's bronze?

882
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:10,536
LIAM: Brass.

883
00:53:10,536 --> 00:53:11,664
SAM: Brass, okay.

884
00:53:11,664 --> 00:53:15,773
LIAM: I take what's left of the ring and I throw
it across the room for Frumpkin to go chasing it across.

885
00:53:15,773 --> 00:53:18,337
MATT: Frumpkin just watches it land. (thunk,
thunk)

886
00:53:18,337 --> 00:53:19,931
LIAM: Go chase that.

887
00:53:19,931 --> 00:53:21,683
MATT: (meows)

888
00:53:21,683 --> 00:53:29,846
TRAVIS: While everybody is going up to their
rooms, can I stay down-- are you staying down?

889
00:53:29,846 --> 00:53:32,400
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm going upstairs, I'm going to
pass out on the floor.

890
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:37,830
TRAVIS: I'll stay downstairs and do some
people-watching. Call it character study.

891
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:43,295
MATT: Okay, yeah. Looking about, at this point in
the evening most of it is filtering out. The few

892
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:54,873
stragglers there are the older folks, grizzled
farmhands with sunburned skin, thick fingers that

893
00:53:54,873 --> 00:54:00,161
have seen a lot of field work, a lot of them
reminiscing about days of old, some of them

894
00:54:00,161 --> 00:54:06,617
talking about some folks they know that were lost
over the previous events, but they seem drunk

895
00:54:06,617 --> 00:54:13,154
enough to at least be smiling and laughing about
these old stories they bring up. You continue to

896
00:54:13,154 --> 00:54:18,257
study these personalities, I imagine you're
probably taking in quirks, taking in elements of

897
00:54:18,257 --> 00:54:22,559
their body language, their vocal intonations for
your own purposes.

898
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,987
TRAVIS: Very well.

899
00:54:24,987 --> 00:54:34,493
MATT: Okay. As you all eventually close the
evening, the morning sun comes to, with Nott

900
00:54:34,493 --> 00:54:38,507
sleeping in a little further after staying up late
creating a vial of acid.

901
00:54:38,507 --> 00:54:40,487
TRAVIS: Please tell me she has bedhead.

902
00:54:40,487 --> 00:54:43,835
LAURA: One ear's up.

903
00:54:43,835 --> 00:54:48,798
MATT: What do you guys want to do?

904
00:54:48,798 --> 00:54:52,630
MARISHA: Hey, Jester?

905
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:53,870
LAURA: Hey, what?

906
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:55,375
MARISHA: I want to show you something.

907
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,787
LAURA: Okay, what?

908
00:54:56,787 --> 00:55:01,972
MARISHA: You know how I stole some shit from the
Baumbauchs on our way out of town? Most of it's

909
00:55:01,972 --> 00:55:09,335
boring shit, but I stayed up and I was trying to
solve it and figure some of this stuff out. Take a

910
00:55:09,335 --> 00:55:10,541
look at this, what do you think?

911
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:17,010
LAURA: Okay. I'm really smart, so I'll probably be
able to figure it out. "Demedan, your request has

912
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:25,985
"been approved and the toordolbo extract will be
arriving in a case of rose wine from the Evening

913
00:55:25,985 --> 00:55:30,813
"Nip in the coming week. Many Gifts, The
Gentleman."

914
00:55:30,813 --> 00:55:35,287
MARISHA: (whispering) The Gentleman. Who's the
Gentleman?

915
00:55:35,287 --> 00:55:41,468
LAURA: I don't know, but I like your addition of
"douche" to Demedan, I agree.

916
00:55:41,468 --> 00:55:44,567
MARISHA: Uh-huh, I wanted to put a reminder for
myself.

917
00:55:44,567 --> 00:55:50,950
LAURA: Oh yeah, who specializes in a rosé? You're
right, that's weird. Especially not the Baumbauchs.

918
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:52,719
MARISHA: No, the Baumbauchs don't make rosé.

919
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:54,195
LAURA: No, they make, like, ale.

920
00:55:54,195 --> 00:55:58,946
MARISHA: You're right. The place where I came
from, you got-- certain regions are going to make

921
00:55:58,946 --> 00:56:04,065
certain kinds of wines. That might tell us where
it's come from. And, what do you think-- I think

922
00:56:04,065 --> 00:56:07,761
the "oblodoro" I think that's a code.

923
00:56:07,761 --> 00:56:09,557
LAURA: "Toordolbo."

924
00:56:09,557 --> 00:56:12,389
MARISHA: I think it's bloodroot.

925
00:56:12,389 --> 00:56:14,522
LAURA: Oh, bloodroot, that's good.

926
00:56:14,522 --> 00:56:16,501
MARISHA: That sounds like a thing, right?

927
00:56:16,501 --> 00:56:20,598
LAURA: What if it's the "boltodoor?"

928
00:56:20,598 --> 00:56:27,938
MARISHA: That's a possibility. I haven't ruled
anything out yet.

929
00:56:27,938 --> 00:56:31,513
LAURA: Bloodroot is probably pretty good, though.

930
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:33,368
MARISHA: Do I know of bloodroot?

931
00:56:33,368 --> 00:56:34,678
MATT: Make a nature check.

932
00:56:34,678 --> 00:56:35,674
MARISHA: Nature check.

933
00:56:35,674 --> 00:56:36,776
LAURA: Would I know bloodroot?

934
00:56:36,776 --> 00:56:41,311
MATT: Make a nature check. You both may make a
nature check in this moment, in a strike of inspiration.

935
00:56:41,311 --> 00:56:44,467
LAURA: 20!

936
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:46,309
MARISHA: Better than me. 13.

937
00:56:46,309 --> 00:56:52,665
MATT: Okay, you've heard it somewhere. Nothing
big, but, like, bloodroot, I've heard of it. You

938
00:56:52,665 --> 00:57:02,520
know it. It's a unique flower that is pretty in
its own right, but you know it because the places

939
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:06,991
where it's used are usually fenced off in a way
that children can't get to them because they are

940
00:57:06,991 --> 00:57:14,113
known to be poisonous. Not to the point of death,
but to the point of severe nausea and vomiting

941
00:57:14,113 --> 00:57:15,354
upon ingestion.

942
00:57:15,354 --> 00:57:22,085
LAURA: Oh, bloodroot. That's right, it's a type of
flower, super-duper red. I know because I tried to

943
00:57:22,085 --> 00:57:28,647
make a paint out of one of the flowers one time and
it made me want to like seriously puke my guts

944
00:57:28,647 --> 00:57:35,952
out. And do the spins, if you know what I mean.
Super bad. That's bad.

945
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:39,277
MARISHA: And they're wanting an extract, so--

946
00:57:39,277 --> 00:57:42,270
LAURA: That means it would be extra strong, yeah.

947
00:57:42,270 --> 00:57:45,647
MARISHA: Are the Baumbauchs trying to poison
people?!

948
00:57:45,647 --> 00:57:54,478
LAURA: Oh my gosh! Well, the Gentleman wants to
poison people. Oh, no, the Baumbauchs, yeah, I

949
00:57:54,478 --> 00:58:00,969
understand. Wow, do we need to tell someone about
this?

950
00:58:00,969 --> 00:58:08,647
MARISHA: No. Just keep it in the back of your head
if you hear something, if something spikes your interest--

951
00:58:08,647 --> 00:58:12,307
LAURA: If we hear about an outbreak of people
vomiting--

952
00:58:12,307 --> 00:58:14,946
MARISHA: --or about a Gentleman.

953
00:58:14,946 --> 00:58:17,697
LAURA: Or about a rosé.

954
00:58:17,697 --> 00:58:20,022
MARISHA: And an Evening Nip.

955
00:58:20,022 --> 00:58:21,109
LAURA: Yeah.

956
00:58:21,109 --> 00:58:24,738
MARISHA: I want to know about these evening
nipples-- evening nip.

957
00:58:24,738 --> 00:58:26,256
TRAVIS: There you go, Freudian slip.

958
00:58:26,256 --> 00:58:32,823
LAURA: In the coming week! That's soon. When did
you steal this?

959
00:58:32,823 --> 00:58:34,595
MARISHA: How many days has it been?

960
00:58:34,595 --> 00:58:38,091
MATT: It's been probably, at this point, four
days, would be my guess.

961
00:58:38,091 --> 00:58:49,109
LAURA: Oh my gosh, what if we could intercept it?
Then we could have all of the poison, and the nips.

962
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:50,470
MARISHA: Interesting.

963
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:55,502
LAURA: I like it.

964
00:58:55,502 --> 00:58:58,966
MARISHA: Let's keep this-- we'll workshop it.

965
00:58:58,966 --> 00:59:01,206
LAURA: Let's make a decision!

966
00:59:01,206 --> 00:59:02,314
MARISHA: You--

967
00:59:02,314 --> 00:59:04,073
LAURA: We just did it!

968
00:59:04,073 --> 00:59:06,174
MARISHA: Yeah we did, we definitely did.

969
00:59:06,174 --> 00:59:12,425
LAURA: Oh man, I'm really hungry, though, I'm going
to go downstairs.

970
00:59:12,425 --> 00:59:14,095
MARISHA: Let's get some food.

971
00:59:14,095 --> 00:59:17,393
MATT: You guys all wake up and get your breakfast
situated and sorted, Nott joining you a little

972
00:59:17,393 --> 00:59:21,483
later on, but you are fed, the morning is fresh,
what would you like to do?

973
00:59:21,483 --> 00:59:25,471
TRAVIS: Well, I guess it's time to collect on
those ears, right?

974
00:59:25,471 --> 00:59:26,495
LAURA: These ears.

975
00:59:26,495 --> 00:59:27,652
TRAVIS: Yes, those ears.

976
00:59:27,652 --> 00:59:34,867
MATT: Asking around, you're eventually led to
where Bryce's location is. Apparently they are in

977
00:59:34,867 --> 00:59:41,784
the process of going through paperwork in the Salt
Trench Jail. That's where the prisoners of

978
00:59:41,784 --> 00:59:50,072
Alfield, this podunk town, keep there imprisoned.
Being led to this small but functional shack of

979
00:59:50,072 --> 01:00:00,109
stone and dried wood, eventually Bryce emerges,
not fully armored, but they're wearing comfortable

980
01:00:00,109 --> 01:00:06,624
robes with a bit of the ceremonial maroon and gold
that a lot of the Crownsguard and members of that

981
01:00:06,624 --> 01:00:12,518
political faction seem to wear. As they emerge,
you see Bryce's face brighten up as they say,

982
01:00:12,518 --> 01:00:19,019
"You're awake! Come, I've been able to gather
enough pay for your deeds the other day. Please,

983
01:00:19,019 --> 01:00:31,450
"do step inside." They lead you over to their desk.
"How many set of ears have been procured?"

984
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:32,912
LAURA: 19 sets.

985
01:00:32,912 --> 01:00:34,805
MATT: "19 sets?"

986
01:00:34,805 --> 01:00:36,001
LAURA: Yeah.

987
01:00:36,001 --> 01:00:37,233
SAM: Or 19 total?

988
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:46,159
LAURA: No, it was 19 sets, I marked down sets.
Technically Matt, I'm not telling Bryce this, five

989
01:00:46,778 --> 01:00:55,945
of those sets are hyenas. 14 of those are gnolls
for sure.

990
01:00:55,945 --> 01:01:03,311
MATT: Bryce has a hard time telling the difference
at the moment, having been overworked and stressed

991
01:01:03,311 --> 01:01:05,142
with the recent goings-on.

992
01:01:05,142 --> 01:01:07,487
LIAM: (whispering) We are assholes.

993
01:01:08,477 --> 01:01:19,505
MATT: Counting through, they finish each bit
counted. "That comes to--" They pull up a small

994
01:01:19,505 --> 01:01:26,072
chest and begin to count out change into a large
sack. Then that fills up into a secondary sack,

995
01:01:26,072 --> 01:01:30,734
into a third one, finishing with, "A total of 570
gold pieces."

996
01:01:33,474 --> 01:01:40,212
LAURA: We also brought home live people and also
some dead people. We brought home seven dead bodies.

997
01:01:40,212 --> 01:01:48,046
MATT: "Seven dead bodies at five gold per seven,
that will come to 35 gold pieces as well." Which

998
01:01:48,046 --> 01:01:52,453
they fill out for you. "Then the live ones were
how many?"

999
01:01:52,453 --> 01:01:56,865
LAURA: 25 gold a piece. How many live people did
we bring back? I didn't have those in jars.

1000
01:01:57,745 --> 01:01:59,952
MARISHA: There were the two.

1001
01:01:59,952 --> 01:02:01,845
SAM: Jules, Petrov, Herma--

1002
01:02:01,845 --> 01:02:04,546
LIAM: I would remember exactly. I don't, but I
do.

1003
01:02:04,546 --> 01:02:07,311
LAURA: That's right I did write down Herma and
Jules, Petrov.

1004
01:02:07,311 --> 01:02:10,101
SAM: Then there was a couple that Shakäste had in
the--

1005
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:10,938
LAURA: Oh wait!

1006
01:02:11,708 --> 01:02:16,121
LIAM: Hold because if he knows he has to tell me
because I picked the right feat for it.

1007
01:02:16,121 --> 01:02:17,254
LAURA: Oh that's right.

1008
01:02:17,254 --> 01:02:25,117
MATT: There were five specifically that you
managed to save actively from the tunnel. Shakäste

1009
01:02:25,117 --> 01:02:27,227
had already saved an additional seven.

1010
01:02:27,227 --> 01:02:30,121
(cheering)

1011
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:30,896
TRAVIS: Damn!

1012
01:02:30,896 --> 01:02:33,162
SAM: We're fucking rich!

1013
01:02:33,162 --> 01:02:36,462
LAURA: Wait, did anybody write down the amount
that he said?

1014
01:02:36,462 --> 01:02:39,703
MARISHA: 570 for the gnolls, 35 for the--

1015
01:02:39,703 --> 01:02:41,662
LIAM: A hundred a piece already.

1016
01:02:41,662 --> 01:02:46,140
MATT: And a fourth sack is presented as they
count out 300-ish more gold pieces.

1017
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:49,841
LAURA: Oh my gosh! That's so good!

1018
01:02:49,841 --> 01:02:52,475
MATT: That's a little over a hundred gold
each.

1019
01:02:52,475 --> 01:02:53,513
LAURA: That's so great!

1020
01:02:53,513 --> 01:02:58,109
MATT: Not bad, almost can afford a suit of armor.

1021
01:02:59,287 --> 01:03:00,534
TRAVIS: A-Fjord?

1022
01:03:01,923 --> 01:03:03,729
MATT: Don't instigate it! You'll regret it.

1023
01:03:05,473 --> 01:03:08,392
LAURA and MARISHA: 150 gold a piece!

1024
01:03:08,682 --> 01:03:09,982
SAM: Are we going to divvy it up?

1025
01:03:09,982 --> 01:03:12,532
LIAM: We are so excited over chump change to Vox
Machina.

1026
01:03:16,742 --> 01:03:25,499
MATT: After all the counting is done Bryce is
writing down feverishly, "For my own ledgers,

1027
01:03:25,499 --> 01:03:31,205
because I do have to present this paperwork to
the crown for the approval of these rewards, what

1028
01:03:31,241 --> 01:03:33,109
do we call you?"

1029
01:03:34,219 --> 01:03:37,031
LAURA: We should have talked about this. What do
you guys think?

1030
01:03:37,031 --> 01:03:38,341
SAM: We're very strong.

1031
01:03:38,341 --> 01:03:40,954
LAURA: That's true we are. We're very strong.

1032
01:03:42,494 --> 01:03:45,578
TALIESIN: We have to leave a paper trail, is that
a thing that actually has to happen?

1033
01:03:45,578 --> 01:03:47,101
LAURA: What if we're The Strong?

1034
01:03:48,221 --> 01:03:49,708
TRAVIS: We're like the mighty.

1035
01:03:49,708 --> 01:03:51,691
LAURA: The Mighty! That's good!

1036
01:03:51,691 --> 01:03:56,135
MARISHA: Hey there new guy, you know good words
that like sound cool in Zemnian right?

1037
01:03:56,135 --> 01:04:01,687
LIAM: We are The Mighty Nein.

1038
01:04:01,687 --> 01:04:02,616
LAURA: Nein?

1039
01:04:02,616 --> 01:04:03,757
MARISHA: Nein!

1040
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:05,053
MATT: The Mighty Nein.

1041
01:04:05,053 --> 01:04:06,389
TALIESIN: I can buy that.

1042
01:04:06,389 --> 01:04:09,024
TRAVIS: Yeah, why not? There's one, two, three,
four--

1043
01:04:09,024 --> 01:04:10,897
LIAM: It's just a spelling that is tricky.

1044
01:04:12,707 --> 01:04:15,232
MATT: "Please, do spell it for me."

1045
01:04:15,232 --> 01:04:20,118
LIAM: Yeah 'Mighty' in Common is spelled M-I--

1046
01:04:20,118 --> 01:04:21,320
TRAVIS: I will pull your beard off your face.

1047
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:22,732
LIAM: H--

1048
01:04:24,472 --> 01:04:25,258
LAURA: Oh my god!

1049
01:04:25,258 --> 01:04:27,807
LIAM: --T-Y.

1050
01:04:27,807 --> 01:04:29,323
MATT: "Yes?"

1051
01:04:29,323 --> 01:04:37,892
LIAM: Now we come to the next word. N-E-I-N.

1052
01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:40,252
LIAM: We are The Mighty Nein.

1053
01:04:40,252 --> 01:04:46,877
MATT: "I feel like I was part of something crowd
sourced similar to this." I feel like I've been

1054
01:04:46,877 --> 01:04:49,174
part of a game call "Mighty Number Nine."

1055
01:04:49,174 --> 01:04:51,477
LAURA: Oh. Really?

1056
01:04:51,477 --> 01:04:54,109
MATT: Yeah. It's a game that I-- It's a Mega
Man--

1057
01:04:54,109 --> 01:04:55,535
LIAM: Nein, nein, nein.

1058
01:04:55,535 --> 01:04:57,334
SAM: That's the number nine.

1059
01:04:57,972 --> 01:05:02,476
MATT: Yes, I know. Oh that game. Anyway!

1060
01:05:02,476 --> 01:05:04,101
LIAM: Oh this game.

1061
01:05:04,101 --> 01:05:12,703
MATT: "All right, The Mighty Nein, that is on
the paperwork. Are you staying a while in Alfield then?

1062
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:20,959
LAURA: Are we staying here? I mean, do you want to
keep hiring us for always?

1063
01:05:22,459 --> 01:05:25,410
MATT: "I don't have much in the way of work here
for your type at the moment."

1064
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:30,223
TRAVIS: You seem to be at peace with the current
situation, I think it might be in our best

1065
01:05:30,223 --> 01:05:31,793
interest that we moved on.

1066
01:05:31,793 --> 01:05:32,819
TALIESIN: Passing through.

1067
01:05:32,819 --> 01:05:33,961
MATT: "Whereabouts are you going?"

1068
01:05:34,461 --> 01:05:36,021
LAURA: We're going to Zadash.

1069
01:05:36,691 --> 01:05:43,775
MATT: "Interesting, well that's much larger for
the tastes of most field folk out here. I lived

1070
01:05:43,775 --> 01:05:48,265
there for about three years when I was younger, in
the West Outersteads before joining the

1071
01:05:48,265 --> 01:05:53,975
Crownsguard and shipping off to Bladegarden. If
you are indeed off to Zadash and are in need of a

1072
01:05:53,975 --> 01:05:59,005
friend, if she's still there. Ask for Claudia
Sheed at the Leaky Tap.

1073
01:05:59,005 --> 01:06:00,744
LIAM: Sheet, did you say Sheet?

1074
01:06:00,744 --> 01:06:01,925
MATT: "Claudia Sheed."

1075
01:06:01,925 --> 01:06:03,296
MARISHA: At the Leaky Tap?

1076
01:06:03,296 --> 01:06:06,144
MATT: "At the Leaky Tap at the East Outersteads."

1077
01:06:07,524 --> 01:06:11,648
LAURA: Oh, I should ask you, is that like the big
inn, the big place?

1078
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:15,193
MATT: "It is of moderate size."

1079
01:06:15,193 --> 01:06:20,915
LAURA: What would be the biggest inn in Zadash?
Like the biggest place that if you go like, "Oh, I

1080
01:06:20,915 --> 01:06:25,292
need to find the biggest inn in Zadash," this is
what it is?

1081
01:06:25,292 --> 01:06:30,541
MATT: That would be the The Pillow Trove. That's
in Tri-Spires. I don't know if you can afford

1082
01:06:30,541 --> 01:06:33,487
that? I don't know, maybe you can! I don't know."

1083
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:39,642
LAURA: I just need the most popular one, because
that's where my mom is going be sending me stuff.

1084
01:06:41,472 --> 01:06:42,696
The Pillow Trove.

1085
01:06:42,696 --> 01:06:43,825
MATT: "Good luck."

1086
01:06:45,515 --> 01:06:46,865
SAM: That's where we're staying?

1087
01:06:46,865 --> 01:06:49,430
TALIESIN: No. That's a fancy inn.

1088
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:51,073
LIAM: Was is pillow or pillar?

1089
01:06:51,073 --> 01:06:57,928
MATT: "The Pillow Trove. But The Leaky Tap I
recommend. Claudia's great; she owns the place if

1090
01:06:57,928 --> 01:06:58,928
she's still there."

1091
01:06:58,928 --> 01:06:59,792
LAURA: Leaky Tap?

1092
01:06:59,792 --> 01:07:00,655
MATT: Leaky Tap.

1093
01:07:00,655 --> 01:07:01,922
MARISHA: Not Tavern, Tap.

1094
01:07:01,922 --> 01:07:03,125
LIAM: Leaky Tap Tavern?

1095
01:07:03,125 --> 01:07:09,504
MATT: "Certain, fine. She's got a good head on her
shoulders and at the very least she may be able to

1096
01:07:09,504 --> 01:07:15,377
guide you to anything you're looking for.
Hopefully. Oh! I almost forgot, follow me please."

1097
01:07:15,377 --> 01:07:22,930
They stand up and close the ledger and lead you
outside. About two blocks down by the outside of

1098
01:07:22,930 --> 01:07:32,894
the stables, titled the On The Wind Stables. There
you see outside a hardy looking female dragonborn.

1099
01:07:32,894 --> 01:07:42,330
Rotund and strong, no tail, who is black scaled,
turns around as you approach and gives a quick

1100
01:07:42,330 --> 01:07:51,721
hand up to Bryce and Bryce approaches. "Ah, thank
you Durmas. Everyone this is Durmas. She is the

1101
01:07:51,721 --> 01:07:59,901
main stable hand here at the On The Wind. We've
taken, as a bit of appreciation here, we've

1102
01:07:59,901 --> 01:08:08,793
outfitted you with a new cart as the previous one
was a bit-- It had carried many of our dead, so

1103
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:15,761
Durmas." And Durmas steps forth and says, "Great.
I have presented for you this cart that we had

1104
01:08:15,761 --> 01:08:21,489
made. It belonged to somebody here, but it is now
yours. It is well made, it is larger than what you

1105
01:08:21,489 --> 01:08:24,477
had previously and does not smell of blood and
feces."

1106
01:08:24,907 --> 01:08:26,323
SAM and TALIESIN: Yet!

1107
01:08:26,323 --> 01:08:30,664
(laughter)

1108
01:08:30,664 --> 01:08:34,113
LIAM: Give us a day.

1109
01:08:34,113 --> 01:08:43,482
MATT: "Very well." She steps back and starts
getting the two horses, one that you had brought

1110
01:08:43,482 --> 01:08:47,526
along and the other that you had discovered out
there. They've already been hitched to the cart.

1111
01:08:47,526 --> 01:08:49,493
TRAVIS: Have they had water?

1112
01:08:49,493 --> 01:08:51,867
MATT: Fed and watered, cleaned, brushed.

1113
01:08:52,754 --> 01:08:54,348
SAM: Is that enough horses? Should we be getting
two more to pull us faster?

1114
01:08:54,348 --> 01:08:55,952
TRAVIS: Two is pretty decent, I think.

1115
01:08:55,952 --> 01:08:56,965
LAURA: Is it?

1116
01:08:56,965 --> 01:08:57,877
SAM: For six?

1117
01:08:57,877 --> 01:08:59,222
LAURA: You're little.

1118
01:08:59,891 --> 01:09:03,708
LIAM: Watchmaster, I'm sorry it slipped my mind.
Is there anywhere still open in town after all of

1119
01:09:03,708 --> 01:09:07,565
the carnage that sells inks and paper?

1120
01:09:07,565 --> 01:09:14,236
MATT: "I'm sure that can be done. Yes, I can lend
you some. I wish you'd told me back in the office."

1121
01:09:14,236 --> 01:09:20,134
LIAM: I'm sorry, but I'm looking for the highest
quality ink. Do you know what I mean?

1122
01:09:20,872 --> 01:09:24,795
MATT: "I think I do, and I don't know if this is
the city to find that, unfortunately. You have

1123
01:09:24,795 --> 01:09:26,376
much better luck in Zadash."

1124
01:09:26,376 --> 01:09:27,576
LIAM: Okay, thank you.

1125
01:09:27,576 --> 01:09:28,441
MATT: "Of course."

1126
01:09:28,441 --> 01:09:40,563
LAURA: Before we leave, can you tell me where
Starosta Kosh's office is?

1127
01:09:40,563 --> 01:09:50,307
MATT: You watch as they smile a bit based on your
sudden interest and they say, "Why do you ask?"

1128
01:09:50,307 --> 01:09:53,493
LAURA: Oh, we have some unfinished business.

1129
01:09:53,493 --> 01:09:59,632
MATT: "Best that I summon him? But I can retrieve
him."

1130
01:09:59,632 --> 01:10:01,283
LAURA: All right.

1131
01:10:01,283 --> 01:10:03,734
SAM: (whispering) Because he's balls deep right
now.

1132
01:10:03,734 --> 01:10:13,504
(laughter)

1133
01:10:13,504 --> 01:10:23,001
MATT: "I'll be right back. We've taken--" And at
that point you hear a slapping sound, you watch as

1134
01:10:23,001 --> 01:10:30,129
Shumas the dragonborn, she's taken the large
manticore head. And is chained into the side and

1135
01:10:30,129 --> 01:10:32,972
slammed it on to the side of the cart. You still
have that.

1136
01:10:32,972 --> 01:10:35,910
LIAM: Did you say her name was Shumas?

1137
01:10:35,910 --> 01:10:39,588
MATT: Shumas-- oh no! Durmas! Sorry.

1138
01:10:40,508 --> 01:10:42,889
LAURA: Dermis is what I wrote down.

1139
01:10:42,889 --> 01:10:44,286
MARISHA: I wrote down Dermis, yeah!

1140
01:10:44,286 --> 01:10:50,346
MATT: No, Shumas is a region in Marquet, sorry. I
have too much in my brain.

1141
01:10:50,346 --> 01:10:53,753
TRAVIS: Du, Du mas! Du mas mich!

1142
01:10:53,753 --> 01:10:56,856
LIAM: This is the best campaign ever!

1143
01:10:56,856 --> 01:11:00,151
TALIESIN: I was trying so hard not to say it.

1144
01:11:00,151 --> 01:11:06,792
MATT: We can slowly crash every song's YouTube's
comments now.

1145
01:11:06,792 --> 01:11:12,911
LIAM: I'm so sorry, Mr. DeAngelo, my high school
German teacher! We're going forward.

1146
01:11:12,911 --> 01:11:18,094
MARISHA: My high school German teacher's first
language was Spanish. It was real weird.

1147
01:11:18,094 --> 01:11:19,850
LIAM: What was their name?

1148
01:11:19,850 --> 01:11:21,590
MARISHA: I don't remember her name.

1149
01:11:21,590 --> 01:11:27,318
LIAM: Okay, mine was Jim DeAngelo. He's the
principal now. I'm sure he's very proud of me.

1150
01:11:28,637 --> 01:11:33,790
MATT: As you guys are getting your stuff situated
onto the cart, eventually you watch as four

1151
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:39,845
crownsguard approach along with Bryce and the
small robed gnomish figure of Starosta Kosh.

1152
01:11:39,845 --> 01:11:44,152
"Right, I've been summoned. What is your
business?"

1153
01:11:44,152 --> 01:11:50,351
LAURA: Yes. Hi! Starosta, it's so wonderful to see
you again.

1154
01:11:50,351 --> 01:11:54,666
MATT: "I've been told that you did a great service
for Alfield and for that I am very thankful."

1155
01:11:54,666 --> 01:12:02,223
LAURA: Yes. I was thinking a really good thing you
could do for us in return is to give my friend

1156
01:12:02,223 --> 01:12:05,345
Fjord here a letter of recommendation to the
Academy.

1157
01:12:09,465 --> 01:12:10,816
MATT: "What?"

1158
01:12:10,816 --> 01:12:13,633
LAURA: He did a great service to your city.

1159
01:12:13,633 --> 01:12:18,279
MATT: "And you have been paid handsomely for it.
As the Watchmaster has notified me."

1160
01:12:18,279 --> 01:12:30,079
LAURA: Starosta, it's good to see you again. It's
been a while, about, hold on. I get out my

1161
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:36,219
sketchbook and I look through it. Maybe like eight
years almost? Your hair hasn't changed though, you

1162
01:12:36,219 --> 01:12:37,476
should change it.

1163
01:12:37,476 --> 01:12:43,375
MATT: "I'm confused? This is strange, but no I
believe that our business is complete."

1164
01:12:43,375 --> 01:12:45,315
LAURA: The Ruby of The Sea says hello.

1165
01:12:45,315 --> 01:13:03,162
MATT: You watch as his face loses color. His hand
drops to his side. "Um. I will be happy to write

1166
01:13:03,162 --> 01:13:09,324
you a letter of recommendation, but I cannot
assure you that it will be accepted as there are

1167
01:13:09,324 --> 01:13:19,944
many points of acceptance within the Academy. And
is quite a bit of travel to Rexxentrum anyway. Is

1168
01:13:19,944 --> 01:13:21,989
this to the actual Soltryce?"

1169
01:13:21,989 --> 01:13:23,165
LAURA: Of course.

1170
01:13:23,165 --> 01:13:26,021
TRAVIS: If you wouldn't mind, that would be most
kind of you.

1171
01:13:26,021 --> 01:13:30,038
MATT: "Very well, it will be done in just a
moment. What is your name?"

1172
01:13:30,038 --> 01:13:31,640
TRAVIS: Fjord.

1173
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,896
SAM: There's a j in it.

1174
01:13:33,896 --> 01:13:35,802
LAURA: Make sure he spells it right, Fjord.

1175
01:13:35,802 --> 01:13:38,595
TRAVIS: Yeah, F-J-O-R-D. Fjord.

1176
01:13:38,595 --> 01:13:40,215
MATT: "Have you a surname?"

1177
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:41,482
TRAVIS: No.

1178
01:13:41,482 --> 01:13:42,782
SAM: Tough.

1179
01:13:42,782 --> 01:13:48,002
(laughter)

1180
01:13:48,002 --> 01:13:49,354
MATT: Fuck you!

1181
01:13:49,354 --> 01:13:59,698
(hysterical laughter)

1182
01:13:59,698 --> 01:14:03,527
TALIESIN: Just been sitting on that shit, haven't
you?

1183
01:14:05,147 --> 01:14:08,677
TRAVIS: We're not going to make it through all of
them.

1184
01:14:08,677 --> 01:14:14,640
MATT: Oh, I was keeping it together so well. Here,
buddy.

1185
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,866
LIAM: Thank you.

1186
01:14:21,476 --> 01:14:28,046
MATT: "I'll return in the next 15 minutes."
Starosta turns and gives a long look of simmering

1187
01:14:28,046 --> 01:14:37,514
fury behind a forced smile to Jester. Spins around
then walks off in a haughty march to wherever he

1188
01:14:37,514 --> 01:14:38,722
came from.

1189
01:14:38,722 --> 01:14:41,804
LAURA: He really should have changed his hair, I
mean it's pretty hideous.

1190
01:14:41,804 --> 01:14:44,143
TALIESIN: You may be my new hero.

1191
01:14:44,143 --> 01:14:47,080
TRAVIS: How is it that you saw him before?

1192
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:49,915
LAURA: Oh, he visited my mother years ago.

1193
01:14:49,915 --> 01:14:53,765
MARISHA: And your mother's The Ruby of The Sea?

1194
01:14:53,765 --> 01:14:56,989
LAURA: Yes, The Ruby of The Sea. You've heard of
her?

1195
01:14:56,989 --> 01:15:00,239
MARISHA: I have now. Have I heard of her?

1196
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:02,319
MATT: Make a history check.

1197
01:15:02,319 --> 01:15:04,027
TRAVIS: Can I do that, too?

1198
01:15:04,027 --> 01:15:04,877
MATT: You may.

1199
01:15:04,877 --> 01:15:08,498
MARISHA: Don't fuck me. That's a natural one.

1200
01:15:08,498 --> 01:15:11,033
TALIESIN: I don't get a bonus, right?

1201
01:15:11,033 --> 01:15:14,291
MATT: You actually wouldn't have.

1202
01:15:14,291 --> 01:15:16,512
TALIESIN: Okay, no that's fine. Oh, I wouldn't
have heard?

1203
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:18,407
MATT: No. It's outside of the Empire.

1204
01:15:18,407 --> 01:15:21,020
TRAVIS: 23 investigation?

1205
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:22,923
MATT: It's history.

1206
01:15:22,923 --> 01:15:25,172
TRAVIS: Oh, history. 21.

1207
01:15:25,172 --> 01:15:32,508
MATT: Okay. This makes sense for you since you
grew up in the Menagerie Coast, though in Port

1208
01:15:32,508 --> 01:15:42,182
Damali. The Ruby of the Sea is well known in some
circles. You've only heard rumors. Belongs to an

1209
01:15:42,182 --> 01:15:49,221
establishment that specializes in all forms of
socializing, entertainment, and is one of the most

1210
01:15:49,221 --> 01:15:59,229
prominent brothels in the Menagerie Coast, in
which the Ruby of the Sea is known to be the star

1211
01:15:59,229 --> 01:16:07,406
courtesan. Many travel all across the Menagerie
Coast and beyond, supposedly, to be within her

1212
01:16:07,406 --> 01:16:15,455
company. Many have fallen in love with her and had
their hearts broken. There are poems and songs

1213
01:16:15,455 --> 01:16:20,284
that have wandered through bars and taverns that
spoke of her, that first caught your interest. It

1214
01:16:20,284 --> 01:16:27,454
seems like a faint, distant tale that was just a
myth that people made up or someone spoke of. Ruby

1215
01:16:27,454 --> 01:16:28,320
of the Sea, it sounds amorphous.

1216
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:33,634
TRAVIS: Of course, I remember now. The Ruby of the
Sea, I can't believe she's your mother.

1217
01:16:33,634 --> 01:16:34,752
SAM: Is she a jeweler?

1218
01:16:34,752 --> 01:16:36,612
LAURA: No.

1219
01:16:36,612 --> 01:16:45,501
TRAVIS: Not exactly. No, she entertains gentlemen.
She's hard to describe, a performer, an

1220
01:16:45,676 --> 01:16:47,254
entertainer or--

1221
01:16:47,441 --> 01:16:54,338
LAURA: Well, she's mostly known for her
hmm-hmm-hmm. Outside of that, her voice is

1222
01:16:54,338 --> 01:16:57,132
amazing, you should hear her sing.

1223
01:16:57,132 --> 01:16:58,978
LIAM: What does that mean?

1224
01:16:58,978 --> 01:17:00,304
LAURA: What does what mean?

1225
01:17:00,304 --> 01:17:01,463
LIAM: Hmm-hmm-hmm.

1226
01:17:01,463 --> 01:17:10,879
LAURA: She has sex for money! Mostly, I mean,
people pay her a large sum. It's like three guys

1227
01:17:10,879 --> 01:17:17,949
mostly, she keeps a few people at a time. She
doesn't see everybody because she's super famous.

1228
01:17:17,949 --> 01:17:24,131
TRAVIS: Yeah, the name has made itself known all
along the coast. You'd be lucky to find yourself

1229
01:17:24,131 --> 01:17:25,942
in her company, at least how I've heard it.

1230
01:17:25,942 --> 01:17:27,528
LAURA: You would, you really would.

1231
01:17:27,528 --> 01:17:32,144
MARISHA: Is that what that song is about?

1232
01:17:32,144 --> 01:17:36,164
LAURA: (singing) The Ruby of the Sea is the best
lay ever!

1233
01:17:36,164 --> 01:17:39,297
SAM: It's a translation, I think.

1234
01:17:39,297 --> 01:17:47,205
SAM and LIAM: It sounds better in the original
Infernal.

1235
01:17:47,205 --> 01:17:49,448
(laughter)

1236
01:17:49,448 --> 01:17:52,875
TRAVIS: Is the best lay ever, oh god.

1237
01:17:54,515 --> 01:17:58,753
MARISHA: I'm so glad I set that up. No regrets.

1238
01:17:58,753 --> 01:18:00,706
TRAVIS: The best lay ever.

1239
01:18:00,706 --> 01:18:03,364
(laughter)

1240
01:18:03,364 --> 01:18:04,857
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

1241
01:18:04,857 --> 01:18:08,779
MATT: A well-known bar jingle all across
Wildemount.

1242
01:18:08,779 --> 01:18:10,333
SAM: It's the whole song.

1243
01:18:10,333 --> 01:18:13,272
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (singing) The Ruby of the Sea
is the best lay ever!

1244
01:18:14,712 --> 01:18:17,292
MATT: It's more of a jingle than a song, really.

1245
01:18:19,182 --> 01:18:22,412
LIAM: I'm picturing a public access infomercial.

1246
01:18:22,412 --> 01:18:26,352
MARISHA: (singing) The Ruby of the Sea, the best
lay ever!

1247
01:18:28,482 --> 01:18:35,378
MATT: (singing) 800-588-Ruby of the Sea now!
Today! Anyway.

1248
01:18:37,508 --> 01:18:39,843
SAM: So you're the daughter of a celebrity.

1249
01:18:39,843 --> 01:18:40,852
LAURA: Yeah.

1250
01:18:40,852 --> 01:18:43,960
SAM: How was that, growing up in fame and
fortune?

1251
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:55,156
LAURA: Well, I wouldn't know exactly, because she
never told anybody that I was there. I bet if she

1252
01:18:55,156 --> 01:18:57,377
had, it would've been crazy.

1253
01:18:57,377 --> 01:19:01,148
LIAM: Then where were you at this point?

1254
01:19:01,148 --> 01:19:03,546
LAURA: You know, in my room.

1255
01:19:03,546 --> 01:19:07,573
SAM: Just trapped in your room?

1256
01:19:07,573 --> 01:19:11,795
LAURA: Well, no I wasn't trapped, but you know--

1257
01:19:11,795 --> 01:19:16,980
LIAM: Did you get to go to the park, did she read
you stories, did she do the things that parents do?

1258
01:19:16,981 --> 01:19:23,485
LAURA: She read me some stories. And a lot of
times I would listen at the door and hear her sing.

1259
01:19:23,485 --> 01:19:24,965
MARISHA: Did she tell people about you?

1260
01:19:24,965 --> 01:19:26,049
LAURA: No.

1261
01:19:26,049 --> 01:19:29,174
TRAVIS: I imagine that would affect her business a
little.

1262
01:19:29,174 --> 01:19:34,712
LAURA: Exactly. I totally understand, she loves me
so much. She really, really does. It's just, you

1263
01:19:34,712 --> 01:19:37,452
know, people frown upon courtesans with daughters.

1264
01:19:37,452 --> 01:19:38,664
TALIESIN: Very fair.

1265
01:19:38,664 --> 01:19:42,169
LIAM: I am sorry, you are from the south, yeah?

1266
01:19:42,169 --> 01:19:43,397
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

1267
01:19:43,397 --> 01:19:52,532
LIAM: I am from the north. Does this include also,
besides the hmm-hmm-hmm, singing and poetry, you said?

1268
01:19:52,532 --> 01:19:53,269
LAURA: Yeah.

1269
01:19:53,269 --> 01:19:55,747
LIAM: So she was skilled as an artisan as well.

1270
01:19:55,747 --> 01:19:58,055
LAURA: Yes! That's why I'm such a good painter.

1271
01:19:58,055 --> 01:20:00,048
LIAM: That's fascinating, for real.

1272
01:20:00,048 --> 01:20:04,440
MARISHA: Did she teach you your spell and fighting
talents?

1273
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:06,771
LAURA: Oh, no, that came from the Traveler.

1274
01:20:06,771 --> 01:20:08,869
LIAM: How did you-- never mind.

1275
01:20:08,869 --> 01:20:11,268
TRAVIS: And this is why you're looking for your
dad?

1276
01:20:11,268 --> 01:20:13,549
LAURA: Well, yes.

1277
01:20:13,549 --> 01:20:16,549
SAM: Was he a client of your mother's?

1278
01:20:16,549 --> 01:20:26,204
LAURA: Well, yes. But-- I feel so nervous all of a
sudden, everybody's looking at me.

1279
01:20:26,204 --> 01:20:27,914
SAM: We can look away.

1280
01:20:27,914 --> 01:20:30,116
MARISHA: Yeah, we'll-- keep talking.

1281
01:20:30,116 --> 01:20:35,630
LAURA: Okay, so they were totally in love and she
was going to marry him, and he was totally in love

1282
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:40,739
with her and he was going to marry her, and they
said they were going to get married, and then she

1283
01:20:40,739 --> 01:20:45,331
got pregnant with me, and he said-- they got
married and he was going to go set up his house,

1284
01:20:45,331 --> 01:20:47,143
and then he just never came back.

1285
01:20:47,143 --> 01:20:49,155
SAM: That's very sad.

1286
01:20:49,155 --> 01:20:50,957
LAURA: I know, it is really sad.

1287
01:20:50,957 --> 01:20:56,423
SAM: So are you going to find him to meet him and
know him, or to seek revenge upon him?

1288
01:20:56,423 --> 01:21:00,056
LAURA: No, I'm going to find him so that I have
somewhere to live because I'm not allowed to be at

1289
01:21:00,056 --> 01:21:01,163
the house anymore.

1290
01:21:01,163 --> 01:21:03,073
SAM: Why aren't you allowed to be at the house
anymore?

1291
01:21:03,073 --> 01:21:06,245
LAURA: Well, because I'm kind of in trouble in
Nicodranas.

1292
01:21:06,245 --> 01:21:07,662
SAM: What did you do?

1293
01:21:07,662 --> 01:21:14,467
LAURA: Well, because I sort of played a prank on
this guy who was seeing my mom.

1294
01:21:14,467 --> 01:21:16,661
SAM: What kind of a prank?

1295
01:21:16,661 --> 01:21:24,121
LAURA: Well-- so the Traveler taught me how to
make myself look like other people, right?

1296
01:21:24,121 --> 01:21:25,153
SAM: Okay.

1297
01:21:25,153 --> 01:21:31,547
LAURA: So, I made myself look like my mom, and
then I lured him out onto our balcony and he was

1298
01:21:31,547 --> 01:21:40,672
wearing nothing but this girdle of hers. And then
I locked the door. And I thought that was funny,

1299
01:21:40,672 --> 01:21:41,309
you know?

1300
01:21:41,309 --> 01:21:41,949
SAM: That is funny--

1301
01:21:41,949 --> 01:21:44,117
LAURA: It looked really good in my sketchbook.

1302
01:21:44,117 --> 01:21:45,049
SAM: So he was just out there in a girdle.

1303
01:21:45,049 --> 01:21:49,345
LAURA: Yeah, which is no big deal. But then I
found out he's a lord.

1304
01:21:49,345 --> 01:21:51,451
SAM: And you embarrassed him?

1305
01:21:51,451 --> 01:21:54,115
LAURA: He was really pissed off.

1306
01:21:54,115 --> 01:21:57,256
LIAM: Was it nighttime or daytime?

1307
01:21:57,256 --> 01:21:58,956
LAURA: It was in the day.

1308
01:21:58,956 --> 01:22:01,048
MARISHA: How many people saw?

1309
01:22:01,048 --> 01:22:02,018
LAURA: Oh, everyone!

1310
01:22:02,018 --> 01:22:03,224
MARISHA: That's so great!

1311
01:22:03,224 --> 01:22:09,745
LAURA: It was so great. But he said he wanted to
kill me and they said--

1312
01:22:09,745 --> 01:22:10,823
MARISHA: That's not great.

1313
01:22:10,823 --> 01:22:15,090
LAURA: --that was cool and he could. So my mom was
like, "Go!" and I was like, "Okay."

1314
01:22:15,090 --> 01:22:17,670
SAM: What was his name, so we can avoid him?

1315
01:22:17,670 --> 01:22:18,493
MARISHA: Yeah.

1316
01:22:18,493 --> 01:22:19,534
TALIESIN: Or not avoid him.

1317
01:22:19,534 --> 01:22:21,123
LAURA: Lord something something.

1318
01:22:21,123 --> 01:22:24,320
SAM: Let's avoid all Lords.

1319
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:25,935
TALIESIN: I'm all right with that.

1320
01:22:25,935 --> 01:22:28,567
LAURA: Lord Robert something something.

1321
01:22:28,567 --> 01:22:29,441
SAM: Robert.

1322
01:22:29,441 --> 01:22:32,557
LAURA: I'll remember it eventually.

1323
01:22:32,557 --> 01:22:35,870
LIAM: Funny is funny. He should have a better
sense of humor.

1324
01:22:35,870 --> 01:22:38,390
LAURA: I thought so, too! He looked really good.

1325
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:40,999
MARISHA: What's wrong with being in a girdle?

1326
01:22:40,999 --> 01:22:42,144
LAURA: I know, right?

1327
01:22:42,144 --> 01:22:44,664
MARISHA: Very waist cinching. Skirt.

1328
01:22:44,664 --> 01:22:46,026
TALIESIN: I'm wearing one right now.

1329
01:22:46,026 --> 01:22:46,976
SAM: I bet you are!

1330
01:22:46,976 --> 01:22:51,669
TALIESIN: No, I'm not. I'm actually just built
this way. I could be, I'm built like I am.

1331
01:22:51,669 --> 01:23:00,220
MARISHA: That's pretty crazy. So you think you can
actually-- hang on, why do you want to live with

1332
01:23:00,220 --> 01:23:03,170
your dad that you never met? Why not just go do
your own thing?

1333
01:23:03,170 --> 01:23:04,203
LAURA: Well, I mean--

1334
01:23:04,203 --> 01:23:07,184
LIAM: Your father is your father, how could you
not be curious about your father?

1335
01:23:07,184 --> 01:23:11,786
LAURA: I know, right? I mean, I've never met him,
I thought it would be cool. That's who I was

1336
01:23:11,786 --> 01:23:14,379
looking for when I met Fjord, over there.

1337
01:23:14,379 --> 01:23:16,500
MARISHA: Sometimes fathers are disappointing.

1338
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:22,339
LIAM: But it is still your right to know your
parents. Who they are, you have to understand

1339
01:23:22,339 --> 01:23:23,609
where you came from.

1340
01:23:23,609 --> 01:23:29,470
LAURA: I mean, he's supposed to be pretty darn
cool. He wears lots of rings on his fingers too,

1341
01:23:29,470 --> 01:23:30,672
you guys!

1342
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:32,231
SAM: Do you know his name?

1343
01:23:32,231 --> 01:23:36,686
MATT: "Ahem!" You look and see that the
Crownsguard are approaching. And there's the

1344
01:23:36,686 --> 01:23:42,324
Starosta Kosh there with a rolled up piece of
parchment which he presents with a broad smile.

1345
01:23:42,324 --> 01:23:44,539
"As you requested."

1346
01:23:44,539 --> 01:23:46,640
LAURA: Thank you, kind sir.

1347
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:52,363
MATT: "Of course, it's everything I can do. Now,
be on your way."

1348
01:23:52,363 --> 01:23:56,097
LAURA: Fjord, it's your letter.

1349
01:23:56,097 --> 01:23:59,395
MATT: "Go! Please."

1350
01:23:59,395 --> 01:24:00,821
LAURA: Bye.

1351
01:24:00,821 --> 01:24:06,558
MATT: He huffs off, they all begin to leave as you
guys go to your cart. The Watchmaster comes up one

1352
01:24:06,558 --> 01:24:14,596
last time and they say, "Sincerely, you've saved
many lives and... A paltry sum I could get

1353
01:24:14,596 --> 01:24:18,062
approved, but know that you have my gratitude.

1354
01:24:18,062 --> 01:24:20,331
LAURA: Thank you, Bryce.

1355
01:24:20,331 --> 01:24:23,585
MATT: "Of course. Good luck to you. I hope our
paths cross again."

1356
01:24:23,585 --> 01:24:29,347
LAURA: Me too. If you see a girl named Yasha, let
her know we are on our way to Zadash.

1357
01:24:29,347 --> 01:24:30,995
SAM: She's tall.

1358
01:24:30,995 --> 01:24:32,080
MATT: "Yasha?"

1359
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:34,342
SAM: Yasha. She carries flowers.

1360
01:24:34,342 --> 01:24:37,487
LAURA: She's super scary looking, but she's got a
heart of gold.

1361
01:24:37,487 --> 01:24:38,771
TALIESIN: Extremely charming.

1362
01:24:38,771 --> 01:24:39,836
MARISHA: Very in shape.

1363
01:24:39,836 --> 01:24:41,945
MATT: "I'll try my best."

1364
01:24:41,945 --> 01:24:42,633
SAM: Black chin.

1365
01:24:42,633 --> 01:24:44,170
TALIESIN: Wearing a girdle.

1366
01:24:44,170 --> 01:24:46,195
(laughter)

1367
01:24:46,195 --> 01:24:47,499
MATT: "All right."

1368
01:24:47,499 --> 01:24:49,122
LIAM: What are you talking about, the bouncer?

1369
01:24:49,122 --> 01:24:52,797
TALIESIN: Oh, she makes her way back every now and
then.

1370
01:24:52,797 --> 01:24:56,377
LAURA: Yeah, Yasha said she was going to catch up
with us, I believe her.

1371
01:24:56,377 --> 01:24:57,207
LIAM: Okay.

1372
01:24:57,207 --> 01:25:02,612
TRAVIS: Yeah, plus she looks like she can handle
herself in a fight. She'd be most welcome.

1373
01:25:02,612 --> 01:25:03,314
TALIESIN: She can.

1374
01:25:03,501 --> 01:25:05,420
LAURA: Do you want to hold on to your letter,
Fjord?

1375
01:25:05,420 --> 01:25:07,421
TRAVIS: Yeah, I would love that, thank you,
Jester.

1376
01:25:07,421 --> 01:25:10,092
LAURA: You're welcome, of course. I told you I
would get you to the Academy.

1377
01:25:10,092 --> 01:25:13,250
MARISHA: That was smooth. I'm into it.

1378
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:16,083
TALIESIN: I forgot to say this is the most
pleasant experience I've ever had at a city

1379
01:25:16,083 --> 01:25:18,835
building before. I could get used to this.

1380
01:25:18,835 --> 01:25:21,683
MARISHA: Yeah, the hero worship is kind of nice.

1381
01:25:21,683 --> 01:25:22,704
LAURA: Yeah, right?

1382
01:25:22,704 --> 01:25:26,025
SAM: Are we sure we want to leave this place?
People like us here.

1383
01:25:26,025 --> 01:25:28,443
LAURA: It's only a matter of time before they
don't.

1384
01:25:28,443 --> 01:25:29,457
LIAM: We have to go.

1385
01:25:30,477 --> 01:25:33,502
TALIESIN: It's like you were born in the circus.
I'm so impressed.

1386
01:25:33,502 --> 01:25:38,070
MARISHA: It's so true. Yeah, let's leave while
we're on a high note.

1387
01:25:38,070 --> 01:25:41,737
LIAM: We want to find a bigger city to disappear
into.

1388
01:25:41,737 --> 01:25:42,466
SAM: Okay.

1389
01:25:42,466 --> 01:25:44,024
MARISHA: Hey, Caleb.

1390
01:25:44,024 --> 01:25:44,932
LIAM: Ja.

1391
01:25:44,932 --> 01:25:47,073
MARISHA: Do you have kids?

1392
01:25:47,843 --> 01:25:48,624
LIAM: No.

1393
01:25:48,624 --> 01:25:50,020
TALIESIN: Insight check.

1394
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:50,863
MATT: All right.

1395
01:25:52,453 --> 01:25:53,749
TALIESIN: 20.

1396
01:25:53,749 --> 01:25:56,814
MATT: 20? Seems, straight and narrow.

1397
01:25:56,814 --> 01:25:57,551
TALIESIN: All right.

1398
01:25:57,551 --> 01:25:58,861
MARISHA: Did you have kids?

1399
01:26:00,071 --> 01:26:00,803
LIAM: No.

1400
01:26:00,803 --> 01:26:07,984
MARISHA: Insight check. 14.

1401
01:26:09,474 --> 01:26:12,202
MATT: Hard to read, but it seems to be fairly
forthright.

1402
01:26:15,462 --> 01:26:20,279
MARISHA: You just have some paternal qualities.
Just you know--

1403
01:26:20,279 --> 01:26:25,570
LIAM: You know I think maybe you are confusing my
good friend and I. You know, she's very little,

1404
01:26:25,570 --> 01:26:33,745
and I am taller. So, it does have that sort of
father-daughter look, but you know well, that's

1405
01:26:33,745 --> 01:26:36,748
not exactly what it is.

1406
01:26:36,748 --> 01:26:39,201
SAM: No, no, no. I'm a goblin.

1407
01:26:39,201 --> 01:26:44,206
LIAM: Yeah. You know if anything-- I've never
really said this out loud before, but if anything

1408
01:26:44,206 --> 01:26:48,760
you're more like a Schwester, a little sister to
me.

1409
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:52,316
SAM: That's nice.

1410
01:26:52,316 --> 01:26:59,235
LAURA: How old are you, Nott? Are you a little
goblin? Or are you a normal adult goblin?

1411
01:26:59,235 --> 01:27:04,383
SAM: Well, you know, the funny things about
goblins is we don't really celebrate birthdays or

1412
01:27:04,383 --> 01:27:10,916
anything so it's hard for me to know exactly.
There's no real holidays in clans.

1413
01:27:10,916 --> 01:27:15,081
LAURA: Are you fully grown or are you still
growing?

1414
01:27:15,081 --> 01:27:27,055
SAM: I'm of child bearing age. So I'm about
somewhere between six and nine.

1415
01:27:29,215 --> 01:27:30,000
LAURA: Okay.

1416
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,215
LIAM: What is today?

1417
01:27:31,215 --> 01:27:36,346
SAM: So that's like a grown-- almost grown
goblin.

1418
01:27:36,346 --> 01:27:37,678
LAURA: Oh, okay.

1419
01:27:37,678 --> 01:27:44,527
SAM: Yeah, but like I said is really hard for me
to tell. It's not like we had a party every year.

1420
01:27:44,527 --> 01:27:46,624
TALIESIN: Birthdays are shite.

1421
01:27:46,624 --> 01:27:50,860
LIAM: What is today in this world, DM?

1422
01:27:50,860 --> 01:27:51,842
MATT: As far as the date?

1423
01:27:51,842 --> 01:27:52,631
LIAM: Yes.

1424
01:27:52,631 --> 01:27:54,926
LAURA: Are you okay?

1425
01:27:54,926 --> 01:27:55,982
MARISHA: No.

1426
01:27:55,982 --> 01:28:00,284
TALIESIN: Did you have one of those sneezes that
actually break something?

1427
01:28:00,284 --> 01:28:03,719
TRAVIS: You know when you sneeze and turn, and
pulls the rib out.

1428
01:28:03,719 --> 01:28:04,790
MARISHA: I think I just pulled a rib.

1429
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:09,517
MATT: I have to go and look that up.

1430
01:28:09,517 --> 01:28:16,677
LIAM: Well I will tell you, we'll get to that, but
I think today we call your birthday.

1431
01:28:16,677 --> 01:28:19,574
SAM: Today we're calling my birthday?

1432
01:28:19,574 --> 01:28:23,580
LIAM: Yeah, you know, we never talked about that.
I didn't realize that, so today is your

1433
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:25,544
Geburtstag, today is your birthday.

1434
01:28:25,544 --> 01:28:26,803
LAURA: Today is your birthday, Nott?

1435
01:28:26,803 --> 01:28:29,845
SAM: Apparently. What day is it?

1436
01:28:29,845 --> 01:28:32,101
LIAM: He doesn't know. He will tell us later.

1437
01:28:32,101 --> 01:28:36,172
SAM: All right. Well for right now, let's say it's
Thursday.

1438
01:28:36,172 --> 01:28:41,893
LIAM: Every year on a Thursday it is your
birthday.

1439
01:28:41,893 --> 01:28:42,792
SAM: All right.

1440
01:28:42,792 --> 01:28:43,794
LIAM: Happy birthday.

1441
01:28:43,794 --> 01:28:44,717
TRAVIS: Congratulations, Nott.

1442
01:28:44,717 --> 01:28:46,019
SAM: Thank you.

1443
01:28:46,019 --> 01:28:48,242
TRAVIS: This is a very special occasion.

1444
01:28:48,242 --> 01:28:51,286
SAM: Do you know a birthday song too?

1445
01:28:53,496 --> 01:28:58,648
LAURA: No. I'm sorry. But I do have this pickle in
my bag.

1446
01:28:58,648 --> 01:29:00,918
SAM: (screams) Is it old?

1447
01:29:00,918 --> 01:29:04,738
LAURA: It was sitting in the jar and I put it in
my bag because we put the ears in here.

1448
01:29:04,738 --> 01:29:07,617
LIAM: Congratulations, today you are a mighty
nine.

1449
01:29:07,617 --> 01:29:15,901
MATT: It is the 12th of Fessuran.

1450
01:29:15,901 --> 01:29:18,121
LAURA: Oh yes, Fessuran.

1451
01:29:18,121 --> 01:29:21,194
MATT: It's getting towards the start of fall.

1452
01:29:21,194 --> 01:29:24,401
SAM: It's already Fessuran!? It feels like
"Huvnufn."

1453
01:29:25,521 --> 01:29:27,635
LIAM: The pumpkin lattes have come out...

1454
01:29:33,475 --> 01:29:35,074
SAM: Well, thank you, Caleb.

1455
01:29:35,074 --> 01:29:38,713
LIAM: Well I didn't do anything, you got me a pile
of gold, so thank you.

1456
01:29:38,713 --> 01:29:39,735
SAM: All right.

1457
01:29:39,735 --> 01:29:41,423
MATT: (coughing)

1458
01:29:41,423 --> 01:29:43,705
SAM: Oh, sorry, we'll leave now.

1459
01:29:43,705 --> 01:29:47,902
MATT: On the other side there is Durmas leaning on
one of the horses. "All right, so, your horses are

1460
01:29:47,902 --> 01:29:49,354
ready, your cart is ready."

1461
01:29:49,354 --> 01:29:51,136
LAURA and TALIESIN: We should go.

1462
01:29:51,136 --> 01:29:52,423
MATT: "You should probably go."

1463
01:29:52,423 --> 01:29:54,083
LAURA: Let's go.

1464
01:29:54,083 --> 01:30:01,090
MATT: All right. Durmas gets behind and pushes the
cart out as the horses clomp out. "My business is

1465
01:30:01,090 --> 01:30:05,577
paid, good luck." She goes back into the stable
and goes about her work.

1466
01:30:07,477 --> 01:30:09,097
TALIESIN: Oh the open road.

1467
01:30:09,799 --> 01:30:11,562
LAURA: Back on the road again.

1468
01:30:11,562 --> 01:30:13,228
TRAVIS: It's crisp out.

1469
01:30:14,251 --> 01:30:16,161
LAURA: I like it. Who is going to be driving this
thing?

1470
01:30:16,161 --> 01:30:17,625
TALIESIN: I could drive this thing.

1471
01:30:17,625 --> 01:30:20,656
SAM: I tried it last time, maybe I'll try again
this time.

1472
01:30:20,656 --> 01:30:21,751
TRAVIS: I like it.

1473
01:30:21,751 --> 01:30:23,927
MATT: Animal handling check.

1474
01:30:25,527 --> 01:30:26,759
SAM: Animal handling?

1475
01:30:26,759 --> 01:30:27,901
MATT: Yeah.

1476
01:30:27,901 --> 01:30:29,365
SAM: 19!

1477
01:30:29,365 --> 01:30:30,947
LAURA: Oh, hey we're getting better!

1478
01:30:30,947 --> 01:30:32,236
TALIESIN: With an 18 bonus.

1479
01:30:32,236 --> 01:30:37,770
MATT: A slight flick of the reins watching your
various allies previously travel with a

1480
01:30:37,770 --> 01:30:41,389
controlled snap, the horses lurch and (clopping).

1481
01:30:43,489 --> 01:30:45,683
SAM: Yeehaw!

1482
01:30:45,683 --> 01:30:48,653
(laughter)

1483
01:30:48,653 --> 01:30:50,735
TALIESIN: That was a good one.

1484
01:30:50,735 --> 01:30:56,023
MATT: With that, you guys make yourselves westward
through the central streets of Alfield. A few folks

1485
01:30:56,023 --> 01:31:01,326
come out and watch you leave, those who were
present for the evening, and with a final silent

1486
01:31:01,326 --> 01:31:07,612
nod and smile you make your way back onto the
Amber Road heading northward deep into the Marrow

1487
01:31:07,843 --> 01:31:12,028
Valley on your way to Zadash. And we're going to
take a break there.

1488
01:31:12,028 --> 01:31:14,502
(cheering)

1489
01:31:14,502 --> 01:31:16,010
MATT: Yay!

1490
01:31:16,010 --> 01:31:17,149
LIAM: Come on in!

1491
01:31:17,149 --> 01:31:18,525
LAURA: Marisha is broken!

1492
01:31:18,525 --> 01:31:20,179
LIAM: Come on broken McGee.

1493
01:31:20,179 --> 01:31:21,093
TRAVIS: You fucking busted a rib did you?

1494
01:31:21,093 --> 01:31:23,225
MATT: Yeah, she did. She was coughing too hard the
week before last.

1495
01:31:23,225 --> 01:31:24,117
LAURA: Are you okay?

1496
01:31:24,117 --> 01:31:25,725
MATT: How are you doing?

1497
01:31:25,725 --> 01:31:28,713
TRAVIS: Yeah, you pulled it. Want me to get it?

1498
01:31:28,713 --> 01:31:32,328
MARISHA: There's shit cracking. Something popped.

1499
01:31:32,328 --> 01:31:36,326
TRAVIS: Yeah, when you sneezed and you turned and
lean away from it, boy.

1500
01:31:36,326 --> 01:31:38,385
MARISHA: I was trying to defend the table.

1501
01:31:38,385 --> 01:31:39,879
LIAM: You've got to Lethal Weapon that shit.

1502
01:31:39,879 --> 01:31:42,513
MARISHA: I'm going to take some Advil.

1503
01:31:42,513 --> 01:31:48,563
MATT: Yeah, you go do that. I'm going to take care
of my wife here in a minute. All right guys, we'll

1504
01:31:48,563 --> 01:31:51,601
be back here in a little bit from the break
continuing the story as they head to the open

1505
01:31:51,601 --> 01:31:56,834
road, heading northward towards Zadash on the
Amber Road. We have our contest from Wyrmwood this

1506
01:31:56,834 --> 01:32:02,385
week, they're giving away two more of their
awesome Kickstarter boxes. This is--

1507
01:32:02,385 --> 01:32:04,996
LIAM: Oh shit, look at that.

1508
01:32:04,996 --> 01:32:13,773
MATT: Those who haven't see it. Get the fuck out
of this thing. There it is! It is their awesome--

1509
01:32:13,773 --> 01:32:15,362
what is this called? Is this the--

1510
01:32:15,362 --> 01:32:16,422
TALIESIN: It's the--

1511
01:32:16,422 --> 01:32:19,406
LIAM and LAURA: Tamarind.

1512
01:32:19,406 --> 01:32:23,984
MATT: Freaking awesome, here comes the dice box,
and then it has this case which has inside of it

1513
01:32:23,984 --> 01:32:25,129
dice, pen--

1514
01:32:25,129 --> 01:32:26,413
LAURA: Look at that pen.

1515
01:32:26,413 --> 01:32:29,838
MATT: It's freaking great. A little section there
for keeping a mini or whatever else you want to

1516
01:32:29,838 --> 01:32:37,481
put in there, we're giving away two of these at
the break so be prepared. Through a

1517
01:32:37,481 --> 01:32:41,175
misunderstanding, you don't have to wait for a
prompt, as soon as we go to break you can enter in

1518
01:32:41,175 --> 01:32:47,780
the chat. So I apologize if I've been fucking with
people, that's on me, that's my fault. For this

1519
01:32:47,780 --> 01:32:53,917
week, the keyword is Gates, G-A-T-E-S, so when we
go to the break enter the Twitch chat room. You

1520
01:32:53,917 --> 01:32:56,748
can only enter it once, if you enter it more than
once you'll be disqualified. I'll have two winners

1521
01:32:56,748 --> 01:33:00,355
for you who will win two of this delightful things
from my friends at Wyrmwood Gaming when we return.

1522
01:33:00,355 --> 01:33:03,437
See you in just a minute.

1523
01:33:03,437 --> 01:48:37,471
[break]

1524
01:48:37,471 --> 01:48:42,293
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome back. Before we
hop back in, the two winners of the Wyrmwood

1525
01:48:42,309 --> 01:48:50,914
giveaway are Jevons and Nicholas Fernandez. Jevons
and Nicholas Fernandez, congratulations, you guys

1526
01:48:50,914 --> 01:48:55,086
won. Danoba will contact you and get your
information so we can get that sent out to you, so

1527
01:48:55,086 --> 01:49:00,056
congrats. All right, everyone seems ready and
iced.

1528
01:49:00,056 --> 01:49:05,363
TRAVIS: Yep. Marisha.

1529
01:49:05,363 --> 01:49:06,509
MARISHA: Uh-huh?

1530
01:49:06,509 --> 01:49:08,800
TRAVIS: Stay frosty.

1531
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:09,540
LIAM: Stop!

1532
01:49:09,540 --> 01:49:11,832
MARISHA: Don't make me laugh!

1533
01:49:13,502 --> 01:49:15,405
TRAVIS: She shouldn't laugh at that.

1534
01:49:15,405 --> 01:49:19,101
MARISHA: This is some bullshit.

1535
01:49:22,141 --> 01:49:24,463
TRAVIS: A rib will be pulled when you turn and
sneeze.

1536
01:49:24,463 --> 01:49:26,374
MATT: Yeah. Don't turn and sneeze!

1537
01:49:26,374 --> 01:49:28,237
MARISHA: Therapeutic D&D right now.

1538
01:49:28,237 --> 01:49:37,347
MATT: Exactly. Speaking of which, guys. You've
begun your trek northward back on the Amber Road,

1539
01:49:38,949 --> 01:49:47,619
passing through the high grass fields, the rolling
hills. The sky grows more cloudy, and as the day

1540
01:49:47,619 --> 01:49:57,588
progresses, uneventful, three horses carrying
crownsguard are patrolling down the Amber Road and

1541
01:49:57,588 --> 01:50:08,106
pass by, and watch them nod as they continue on.
As you continue down, for the remainder of the

1542
01:50:08,106 --> 01:50:14,810
day-- you guys probably left around noon. Eight
hours of travel, would say is a standard travel

1543
01:50:14,810 --> 01:50:17,709
day for a horse, so that'll be just past sunset.

1544
01:50:17,709 --> 01:50:21,424
LAURA: Well, Nott slept in until noon, so we
probably left a couple of hours after that.

1545
01:50:21,424 --> 01:50:30,238
MATT: That's true. So you get back a little bit on
the travel. Not too bad. Continuing on, you hit

1546
01:50:30,238 --> 01:50:37,503
sunset, and your horse could go for a few more
hours. Do you wish to continue to travel in the

1547
01:50:37,503 --> 01:50:38,667
night? Follow the road?

1548
01:50:38,667 --> 01:50:44,897
LIAM: No, why would we be ambitious like that?
We're not in a hurry.

1549
01:50:44,897 --> 01:50:47,556
LAURA: Is there a good place to make shelter?

1550
01:50:47,556 --> 01:50:52,086
TALIESIN: I'd say we pull off if we see something
really nice.

1551
01:50:52,086 --> 01:50:58,573
MATT: Right as the sky begins to grow dark enough
to threaten vision for distant vision, at least.

1552
01:50:59,389 --> 01:51:01,609
You use darkvision, you have a closer proximity.

1553
01:51:01,609 --> 01:51:05,412
MARISHA: I put on my goggles way too early. I'm
super stoked about them.

1554
01:51:05,412 --> 01:51:07,376
(laughter)

1555
01:51:07,376 --> 01:51:09,595
LAURA: I'm just seeing you at Burning Man.

1556
01:51:09,595 --> 01:51:12,969
MARISHA: Yeah, totally! 100 percent! That's kind
of how I imagined them is Burner goggles.

1557
01:51:12,969 --> 01:51:17,483
MATT: The sky is as dark and the distance is as
hard to see. But nearby, there's some decent

1558
01:51:17,483 --> 01:51:19,388
shapes and outlines.

1559
01:51:19,388 --> 01:51:21,230
LIAM: Ferris Bueller, all the time.

1560
01:51:21,230 --> 01:51:22,101
MATT: Yep.

1561
01:51:22,101 --> 01:51:25,923
LIAM: I'm sorry. Don't laugh.

1562
01:51:25,923 --> 01:51:37,278
MATT: "Are you in here for drugs?" "No. What are
you in for?" "Drugs." You don't see any landmarks

1563
01:51:37,278 --> 01:51:42,644
that would gather your attention to be a place to
stay or stop at or rest for the evening. Your best

1564
01:51:42,644 --> 01:51:46,703
plans would be to look for something not far off
the road in the natural environment to make camp.

1565
01:51:46,703 --> 01:51:48,388
Who is helming that expedition?

1566
01:51:48,388 --> 01:51:51,777
LAURA: I'll help him.

1567
01:51:51,777 --> 01:51:53,962
MATT: Both you guys roll perception.

1568
01:51:57,472 --> 01:51:59,155
LAURA: Did you roll good?

1569
01:51:59,155 --> 01:52:03,167
TALIESIN: I did! 19! Thank you, Gil.

1570
01:52:03,167 --> 01:52:04,903
LAURA: 17.

1571
01:52:04,903 --> 01:52:10,435
MATT: Okay. You find a small clearing that looks
to be a handful of rocks that were partially

1572
01:52:10,435 --> 01:52:15,521
lodged into the ground long ago that have since
been overgrown with moss and grass. But there is a

1573
01:52:15,521 --> 01:52:19,750
bit a small opening where it looks to be the
remains of charcoal. A fire has once, or many

1574
01:52:19,750 --> 01:52:24,509
times, been built and then put out there. So it
looks like a standard place where people have set

1575
01:52:24,509 --> 01:52:29,968
up camp while making their trips up and down the
Amber Road. Easy enough to do. So you guys set up

1576
01:52:29,968 --> 01:52:35,380
for the evening? You gather yourselves around,
build a small fire.

1577
01:52:35,380 --> 01:52:38,026
LAURA: You should use your glove and make a fire
for us.

1578
01:52:38,945 --> 01:52:41,068
TRAVIS: Oh, right before the day goes?

1579
01:52:41,068 --> 01:52:43,490
LAURA: Well. Unless something attacks us again.

1580
01:52:43,490 --> 01:52:46,472
LIAM: If you are going to do that, we all need to
stand 50 feet back.

1581
01:52:46,472 --> 01:52:47,690
LAURA: Why?

1582
01:52:47,690 --> 01:52:51,565
LIAM: Because it's not a little (fut fut). It's a
big one.

1583
01:52:51,565 --> 01:52:54,497
LAURA: Oh, okay. Never mind then. Who has a (fut
fut)?

1584
01:52:54,497 --> 01:52:56,194
LIAM: I have a (fut fut).

1585
01:52:56,194 --> 01:52:58,225
LAURA: Okay, then do it.

1586
01:52:58,225 --> 01:53:00,382
LIAM: (fire burning)

1587
01:53:00,382 --> 01:53:08,587
MATT: It doesn't make much of a (fut fut), much to
your disappointment. But a fire is built. You all

1588
01:53:08,587 --> 01:53:11,689
begin to bed down for the evening, and who's
taking first watch?

1589
01:53:11,689 --> 01:53:13,414
LIAM: I am.

1590
01:53:13,414 --> 01:53:18,877
MATT: Okay. You can break it up between, probably
let's say, three watches over a casual evening.

1591
01:53:18,877 --> 01:53:20,050
TRAVIS: I'll take the second.

1592
01:53:20,050 --> 01:53:21,079
MARISHA: I'll take the last.

1593
01:53:21,079 --> 01:53:22,568
MATT: Perception check from you, please.

1594
01:53:22,568 --> 01:53:26,629
LIAM: Yeah, okay. Ten.

1595
01:53:26,629 --> 01:53:32,071
MATT: Okay. An uneventful evening continues for
you. You trade off to Fjord. Fjord, make a

1596
01:53:32,071 --> 01:53:33,313
perception check.

1597
01:53:34,785 --> 01:53:37,429
TRAVIS: Nine.

1598
01:53:37,429 --> 01:53:46,217
MATT: Your mighty nine allows you to keep an eye
out as the dark perimeter seems to bring no shapes

1599
01:53:46,217 --> 01:53:51,622
or movements of interest other than the occasional
sound of the wind blowing through the fields and

1600
01:53:51,622 --> 01:53:56,749
the distant dark. Then your watch is up.
Beauregard, perception check, please.

1601
01:53:58,362 --> 01:54:00,132
MARISHA: Seven.

1602
01:54:00,132 --> 01:54:01,441
LAUDA: Oh god!

1603
01:54:01,441 --> 01:54:03,433
LIAM: It's gotten lower and lower.

1604
01:54:03,433 --> 01:54:10,902
MATT: Keeping an eye out, best you can, the sleep
takes you eventually and you end up cheating on

1605
01:54:10,902 --> 01:54:15,472
the last few hours of your watch. Nevertheless,
you all come to consciousness in the morning

1606
01:54:15,472 --> 01:54:27,941
intact and fine. You begin your way further on the
road for a second day. Now, who's guiding the-- I

1607
01:54:27,941 --> 01:54:32,676
would say more of who's keeping a perimeter watch
during the next day's journey?

1608
01:54:32,676 --> 01:54:33,788
TRAVIS: I will.

1609
01:54:33,788 --> 01:54:35,287
LAURA: I'll help.

1610
01:54:35,287 --> 01:54:39,249
MATT: All right. So one of you two, we'll say
that's the case, make a perception check with

1611
01:54:39,249 --> 01:54:41,826
advantage because of Jester's aiding.

1612
01:54:42,402 --> 01:54:43,426
TRAVIS: Thank you, Jester.

1613
01:54:43,426 --> 01:54:44,797
LAURA: You're welcome!

1614
01:54:44,797 --> 01:54:49,051
TRAVIS: Oh jeez, that's terrible. Nine!

1615
01:54:49,051 --> 01:54:52,041
(laughter)

1616
01:54:52,041 --> 01:54:53,336
MATT: Keeping with the theme of the name, I
guess.

1617
01:54:53,336 --> 01:54:59,514
TALIESIN: For the record, we're hiding all of our
valuables. If that's okay. Making sure everything

1618
01:54:59,514 --> 01:55:01,833
is stowed. I would assume we're hiding all of--

1619
01:55:01,833 --> 01:55:03,874
LAURA: You know how to do that because you're on
the road a lot.

1620
01:55:03,874 --> 01:55:04,967
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know how.

1621
01:55:04,967 --> 01:55:06,204
TRAVIS: That's even worse!

1622
01:55:06,204 --> 01:55:08,664
MARISHA: We did scoop up those chains, right? We
put those in the wagon?

1623
01:55:08,664 --> 01:55:09,667
LAURA: Yeah, of course!

1624
01:55:09,896 --> 01:55:11,237
MATT: Yeah, those are still with you.

1625
01:55:11,237 --> 01:55:12,721
LIAM: The shitty manacles?

1626
01:55:12,721 --> 01:55:14,671
LAURA: Yeah! That we'll sell to a blacksmith.

1627
01:55:14,671 --> 01:55:15,721
LIAM: Yeah, excellent.

1628
01:55:15,721 --> 01:55:17,193
MARISHA: Metal's valuable, man.

1629
01:55:17,193 --> 01:55:19,501
LAURA: Along with this giant sledgehammer!

1630
01:55:19,501 --> 01:55:21,395
LIAM: That is a glaive.

1631
01:55:21,395 --> 01:55:23,665
LAURA: No, I have a sledgehammer too.

1632
01:55:23,665 --> 01:55:28,275
LIAM: Oh, that's right! You also picked up a
sledgehammer, yeah. Sledge!

1633
01:55:28,275 --> 01:55:37,981
MATT: Continuing on for the rest of the day,
eventually you pass by a small travel wagon. It's

1634
01:55:37,981 --> 01:55:43,720
similar to the size of the cart that you have, but
it has some cushioned seats set up in the back.

1635
01:55:43,720 --> 01:55:51,233
You look towards three, well dressed individuals
that are looking miserable. They're sitting in the

1636
01:55:51,233 --> 01:55:56,923
back of the cart as it rides by with a single
coachman whose single horse is pulling it along

1637
01:55:56,923 --> 01:56:02,567
with a rather rapid pace. You watch as they begin
to approach, the few bumps that hit the road are

1638
01:56:02,567 --> 01:56:05,810
hitting them relatively hard because of the pace
of which they're keeping. Some of them kind of get

1639
01:56:05,810 --> 01:56:09,284
flung up, and you watch their hair get mussed and
they quickly put it back into place.

1640
01:56:09,284 --> 01:56:11,691
MARISHA: What kind of cargo does it look like they
have?

1641
01:56:11,691 --> 01:56:13,109
MATT: Make a perception check.

1642
01:56:13,109 --> 01:56:15,737
LAURA: I want to draw a sketch of them in a little
pan popping like popcorn.

1643
01:56:15,737 --> 01:56:17,287
MATT: Okay.

1644
01:56:17,287 --> 01:56:20,912
MARISHA: As she's doing that, I'm trying to get
Jester's attention. I'm like: Jester! Jester!

1645
01:56:20,912 --> 01:56:21,732
LAURA: What?

1646
01:56:26,202 --> 01:56:29,605
MARISHA: 13. (whispers) The Gentlemen.

1647
01:56:29,605 --> 01:56:31,330
LAURA: (whispers) The Gentlemen.

1648
01:56:31,330 --> 01:56:37,967
MATT: The best you can tell, the cargo within are
personal bags. There's nothing of what looks to be

1649
01:56:37,967 --> 01:56:42,534
cargo cargo, at least what you have seen in
previous bits of people that have traveled down

1650
01:56:42,534 --> 01:56:46,259
here. Especially the trade caravan you passed on
your way up to Alfield. This looks to be more of a

1651
01:56:46,259 --> 01:56:56,620
personnel-based journey. They pass glaring as they
look at your colorful variety of individuals.

1652
01:56:57,200 --> 01:56:59,082
LAURA: Are they going the opposite direction than
us?

1653
01:56:59,082 --> 01:57:00,118
MATT: Yeah, heading south.

1654
01:57:02,448 --> 01:57:08,014
LAURA: (whispering) Should I ask if they're the
Gentlemen? (shouting) Good to see you, Gentlemen!

1655
01:57:08,014 --> 01:57:12,379
MARISHA: Gentlemen. Do any of them look--

1656
01:57:12,999 --> 01:57:14,650
SAM: Like a gentleman?

1657
01:57:14,650 --> 01:57:16,627
MARISHA: Like a gentleman.

1658
01:57:16,627 --> 01:57:24,960
MATT: I mean, they're well-dressed. They look to
be of bourgeois class. Not upper crust, but better

1659
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:30,217
than most you've encountered on this side of the
Empire at least. And they seem to almost-- aside

1660
01:57:30,217 --> 01:57:35,875
from glaring as you pass-- pay no mind to any of
your verbiage beyond, you motherfuckers.

1661
01:57:37,445 --> 01:57:39,919
MARISHA: I think they thought we were patronizing
them.

1662
01:57:39,919 --> 01:57:43,215
LAURA: Oh. Yeah. Probably.

1663
01:57:43,215 --> 01:57:44,454
MARISHA: We kind of were, though.

1664
01:57:44,454 --> 01:57:45,323
LAURA: Yeah, kind of.

1665
01:57:49,443 --> 01:57:50,369
MARISHA: What?

1666
01:57:50,369 --> 01:57:52,449
LIAM: It worked. Never mind.

1667
01:57:52,449 --> 01:57:59,323
MATT: All right. Continuing on for the remainder
of the day, seeing nothing else that catches your

1668
01:57:59,323 --> 01:58:06,198
eye along the journey, eventually the night comes
to a close once more. You guys have pretty much

1669
01:58:06,198 --> 01:58:12,191
hit the extent of your horses' energy for the day's
travel right as the sun begins to set. So you can

1670
01:58:12,191 --> 01:58:14,795
pull off and make another camp for this evening.

1671
01:58:14,795 --> 01:58:16,053
LAURA: We find a good place?

1672
01:58:16,053 --> 01:58:17,447
MATT: Who's helming that one?

1673
01:58:17,447 --> 01:58:19,923
LAURA: I mean, we did such a good job last time.

1674
01:58:19,923 --> 01:58:20,904
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's do it again.

1675
01:58:20,904 --> 01:58:22,059
MATT: Go for it!

1676
01:58:23,689 --> 01:58:25,330
LAURA: Oh no, that is bad.

1677
01:58:25,330 --> 01:58:26,268
TALIESIN: This is perception?

1678
01:58:26,268 --> 01:58:26,862
MATT: Yes.

1679
01:58:26,862 --> 01:58:27,663
TALIESIN: 14.

1680
01:58:27,663 --> 01:58:28,436
LAURA: Five.

1681
01:58:28,436 --> 01:58:33,934
MATT: Not too-- ooh, not good for you. That's
fine. Easy enough, you find--

1682
01:58:33,934 --> 01:58:35,102
LAURA: I find grass!

1683
01:58:37,202 --> 01:58:44,025
MATT: You find, maybe a few hundred feet off of
the eastern side of the Amber Road, a small dip in

1684
01:58:44,025 --> 01:58:50,764
the ground. It looks like an area where the earth
seems to sink almost a bit. This crucible-type

1685
01:58:50,764 --> 01:58:58,822
look for maybe 60 or so feet. There in the center,
you see another well-used stop along the way.

1686
01:58:58,822 --> 01:59:06,594
There's some discarded, empty scraps of sack. You
can see a couple of small stone rings where fires

1687
01:59:06,594 --> 01:59:11,134
were previously set. There's a lot of travel on
this road, and so it's not too difficult, if

1688
01:59:11,134 --> 01:59:15,917
you're keeping an eye out for a while, to find
some place that's been used over time as a place

1689
01:59:15,917 --> 01:59:18,235
to rest for the evening. So you set up camp there
without an issue.

1690
01:59:18,235 --> 01:59:19,211
TALIESIN: Yeah. Set up again.

1691
01:59:19,211 --> 01:59:21,694
LAURA: Do we put an alarm around us in case?

1692
01:59:21,694 --> 01:59:22,985
LIAM: I do that every night.

1693
01:59:22,985 --> 01:59:24,875
LAURA: Oh! Wonderful.

1694
01:59:24,875 --> 01:59:26,260
LIAM: It's just a given.

1695
01:59:26,260 --> 01:59:27,279
LAURA: Nice.

1696
01:59:27,279 --> 01:59:29,229
TALIESIN: That's a griffin.

1697
01:59:29,229 --> 01:59:30,959
LIAM: A gif-in.

1698
01:59:30,959 --> 01:59:34,485
LAURA: Should we three take watch since those
three took watch last time?

1699
01:59:34,485 --> 01:59:35,533
TALIESIN: That's only fair!

1700
01:59:35,533 --> 01:59:36,656
SAM: Yes, that sounds good.

1701
01:59:36,656 --> 01:59:37,649
TALIESIN: I'll take watch number one!

1702
01:59:37,649 --> 01:59:39,220
SAM: I'll take number two!

1703
01:59:39,220 --> 01:59:40,403
LAURA: I'll take number three!

1704
01:59:40,403 --> 01:59:45,279
LIAM: Yes, DM, I would like to say that, too. If
we're ever camping outside, just because Liam is a

1705
01:59:45,279 --> 01:59:50,552
dumb fuck and will forget it. Every night, Caleb
does silver thread around the group.

1706
01:59:50,552 --> 01:59:53,532
MATT: Right. For a 20-foot cube.

1707
01:59:53,532 --> 01:59:56,040
LIAM: Okay. That's around us, yeah.

1708
01:59:56,040 --> 01:59:59,593
MATT: All right. So after setting up your alarm--

1709
01:59:59,593 --> 02:00:02,224
LIAM: (singing) It's murder time in the campaign.

1710
02:00:02,224 --> 02:00:08,584
MATT: As you complete your set up for the evening,
make a perception check.

1711
02:00:11,124 --> 02:00:12,217
TALIESIN: Six.

1712
02:00:12,217 --> 02:00:16,213
TRAVIS: What the fuck?! We can't roll perception
for shit.

1713
02:00:16,213 --> 02:00:18,056
TALIESIN: I shouldn't have touched this die. This
die has been nothing but trouble.

1714
02:00:18,056 --> 02:00:31,805
MATT: Okay. You are sitting back for a minute ,
the fire crackling to a very diminutive ember.

1715
02:00:31,805 --> 02:00:38,459
There's just a bit of light slowly flickering off,
framing the outer shapes of your various sleeping

1716
02:00:38,459 --> 02:00:49,203
friends and companions. You don't hear the
snapping of twigs because it's subtle enough. A

1717
02:00:49,203 --> 02:00:56,306
brief tickle hits the back of your head, Caleb, as
the thread perimeter is broken.

1718
02:00:56,316 --> 02:00:59,832
LIAM: Nein, nein! Up. Up!

1719
02:00:59,832 --> 02:01:06,880
MATT: As that happens, a voice goes, "I wouldn't
do that if I were you!" At which point, you

1720
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:11,069
immediately whip around and you guys see, in the
vicinity, standing directly around where you're

1721
02:01:11,069 --> 02:01:15,735
sleeping, you see nine figures.

1722
02:01:15,735 --> 02:01:19,681
MARISHA: Nine! Are they mightier than us, though?

1723
02:01:19,681 --> 02:01:27,812
MATT: This number coming up is so creepy, you
guys. They all look humanoid-- some variation to

1724
02:01:27,812 --> 02:01:36,191
height, but most of them seem to be standard human
size. Various degrees of patchwork: hide armors,

1725
02:01:36,191 --> 02:01:41,024
some leathers, a lot of what seems to be cobbled
together and scrapped to build some sort of

1726
02:01:41,024 --> 02:01:50,591
defense. You see a uniform mismatch of green,
blues, and black cloths that are covering most of

1727
02:01:50,591 --> 02:01:51,964
the faces. And hoods.

1728
02:01:51,964 --> 02:01:54,696
MARISHA: Green and black? That's weird.

1729
02:01:54,696 --> 02:01:58,407
MATT: One's green. One's blue. Couple of black.

1730
02:01:58,407 --> 02:02:00,308
MARISHA: Oh my god, we're fighting the Ninja
Turtles!

1731
02:02:00,308 --> 02:02:04,005
SAM: That'd be purple, blue, and orange.

1732
02:02:04,005 --> 02:02:13,537
MATT: Yeah, completely different thing. As you all
begin to come to conscious and look around, you

1733
02:02:13,537 --> 02:02:20,195
can see some of them have hand crossbows that
they're holding out in front. Two of them have

1734
02:02:20,195 --> 02:02:25,696
heavy crossbows that are currently being held with
two hands that are all locked in. There are a few

1735
02:02:25,696 --> 02:02:32,000
of them that have shortswords drawn, one in each
hand. They're all threatening, but not raring to

1736
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:39,604
leap. The one that had spoken out against that,
who's right behind you, Molly. With his boot,

1737
02:02:39,604 --> 02:02:46,657
presses it against the blade of one of your
scimitars, and says, "I would recommend you just

1738
02:02:46,657 --> 02:02:54,070
take a step away from that." You feel this very
sharp point of a nocked crossbow bolt that taps

1739
02:02:54,070 --> 02:02:55,754
the back of your skull.

1740
02:02:57,764 --> 02:03:03,605
TALIESIN: Oh, you're so polite. How could I
refuse? I just get up. I'm not turning around.

1741
02:03:03,605 --> 02:03:05,646
Both my scimitars or just one of them?

1742
02:03:05,646 --> 02:03:12,921
MATT: They're both set in your usual, placed
wrapping. Your ceremonial set before you go to bed

1743
02:03:12,921 --> 02:03:13,937
at night.

1744
02:03:13,937 --> 02:03:15,517
TALIESIN: I'm just going to walk to the cart,
then.

1745
02:03:15,517 --> 02:03:16,381
MATT: Okay.

1746
02:03:16,381 --> 02:03:17,606
MARISHA: Wait, do they have them?

1747
02:03:17,606 --> 02:03:19,144
MATT: He's stepping on them right now.

1748
02:03:19,144 --> 02:03:20,392
TALIESIN: I'm walking to the cart.

1749
02:03:20,392 --> 02:03:24,835
MATT: Okay. As you begin to walk towards the cart,
which is breaking the perimeter of their holding,

1750
02:03:24,835 --> 02:03:32,810
the ones on that side go (disapproving sounds).
The one who spoke up before just goes, "All right.

1751
02:03:32,810 --> 02:03:41,956
No big moves. No trouble wanted. Get your friends
up. Place your valuables onto that cart for us,

1752
02:03:41,956 --> 02:03:47,160
you have hitched over there. And we'll leave you
with your life. No worries-- "

1753
02:03:47,160 --> 02:03:49,267
LIAM: I would like to cast Friends on that
gentleman.

1754
02:03:49,267 --> 02:03:52,599
MATT: Okay. Make a sleight of hand check.

1755
02:03:52,599 --> 02:03:59,567
LIAM: Ah, that's very low. That is a five.

1756
02:04:02,237 --> 02:04:07,953
MATT: As soon as you begin to-- and, correct me if
I'm wrong. Friends-- actually, let me see here.

1757
02:04:10,493 --> 02:04:12,807
Friends is-- no! It's--

1758
02:04:14,497 --> 02:04:20,258
LIAM: Somatic and material. All I did was just do
this with my thumb and I put a little bit of rouge

1759
02:04:20,258 --> 02:04:21,608
on my cheek.

1760
02:04:21,608 --> 02:04:28,983
MATT: Okay. Yeah, so your charisma checks. The
spell seems to take an effect.

1761
02:04:28,983 --> 02:04:35,130
LIAM: You'll have to be careful. We are going for
help. Medical help. We all have syphilis.

1762
02:04:37,430 --> 02:04:39,829
Extreme syphilis.

1763
02:04:39,829 --> 02:04:42,041
MATT: Make a deception check.

1764
02:04:42,041 --> 02:04:42,852
TRAVIS: Extreme.

1765
02:04:44,462 --> 02:04:46,095
MARISHA: Oh my god, brilliant!

1766
02:04:47,475 --> 02:04:51,173
LIAM: Is this with advantage, right? That's the
effect of the spell.

1767
02:04:51,173 --> 02:04:52,622
MATT: Yeah, it gives you advantage. Yeah.

1768
02:04:52,622 --> 02:04:55,573
LIAM: Yeah. Oh yeah.

1769
02:04:57,233 --> 02:04:58,669
SAM: Ah, that's some good syphilis.

1770
02:05:00,499 --> 02:05:02,202
LIAM: That is a 22.

1771
02:05:02,202 --> 02:05:03,627
TRAVIS: Cauliflower crotch, baby.

1772
02:05:03,627 --> 02:05:07,831
LIAM: 22. We are riddled with it.

1773
02:05:08,441 --> 02:05:15,413
MATT: You watch as one of the eyes over the face
scarf closes and twitches. He goes, "Right, good

1774
02:05:15,413 --> 02:05:17,093
to know. Then--"

1775
02:05:17,093 --> 02:05:18,523
(Liam sneezes loudly)

1776
02:05:18,523 --> 02:05:21,015
MATT: "I suppose we're going to be leaving you
unspoiled."

1777
02:05:21,015 --> 02:05:28,958
SAM: I'll stand up and go next to Caleb, and say:
Honey, did you tell them about our disease?

1778
02:05:28,958 --> 02:05:42,187
LIAM: Oh, it's so much worse! Pity on us, please.
We are just trying to get medical help.

1779
02:05:42,187 --> 02:05:47,447
MATT: "Then I suggest you all just get down on
your knees and stay where you are. We're just

1780
02:05:47,447 --> 02:05:51,099
going to take your cart and what's inside of it."

1781
02:05:51,099 --> 02:05:53,022
LIAM: What was that?

1782
02:05:53,022 --> 02:05:59,304
MATT: Take the cart and what's inside of it. They
all begin to shift slowly, all keeping their

1783
02:05:59,304 --> 02:06:04,091
weapons drawn, begin to move over towards the
cart. One of them hops up into the back and begins

1784
02:06:04,091 --> 02:06:05,156
rummaging through the stuff.

1785
02:06:05,156 --> 02:06:07,287
TALIESIN: I wouldn't touch that. That might, ooh.

1786
02:06:07,287 --> 02:06:10,006
LAURA: Oh, no, that's where we got our syphilis
from!

1787
02:06:10,006 --> 02:06:12,831
TALIESIN: There's a severed head in there.

1788
02:06:12,831 --> 02:06:15,517
MARISHA: Yeah, look out for that manticore head.
They're diseased.

1789
02:06:15,517 --> 02:06:19,873
MATT: At which point, one of them pull over a
cloth. He goes, "Jesus Chri--" They all turn

1790
02:06:19,873 --> 02:06:24,723
around, weapons drawn again like, "What the fuck
are these people doing?"

1791
02:06:24,723 --> 02:06:29,336
LIAM: No, we might have tried a few things with
that head, but, you know, we've paid the price.

1792
02:06:29,336 --> 02:06:31,887
Clearly we have suffered enough!

1793
02:06:35,167 --> 02:06:36,507
MATT: Looks over to Fjord.

1794
02:06:36,507 --> 02:06:38,395
LAURA: He's just laughing.

1795
02:06:42,505 --> 02:06:44,341
MATT: "You also infected?"

1796
02:06:44,341 --> 02:06:51,502
(laughter)

1797
02:06:51,502 --> 02:06:58,487
LIAM: I mean, the amount of contact we have had,
there is no question. You have to go. (dying noises)

1798
02:06:58,487 --> 02:07:00,158
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

1799
02:07:02,288 --> 02:07:03,272
LIAM: It's not as good.

1800
02:07:03,272 --> 02:07:05,010
MARISHA: Oh, come on.

1801
02:07:05,010 --> 02:07:06,772
LAURA: Do you get advantage? Because he's a
friend?

1802
02:07:06,772 --> 02:07:08,254
LIAM: On this, for with my Friends?

1803
02:07:08,254 --> 02:07:10,115
MATT: This would be the very tail end of your
Friends spell.

1804
02:07:10,115 --> 02:07:11,155
LIAM: Is it the same guy?

1805
02:07:11,487 --> 02:07:12,296
MATT: Yeah.

1806
02:07:12,296 --> 02:07:14,447
MARISHA: Do it.

1807
02:07:14,447 --> 02:07:18,511
LIAM: It's better. It's 13.

1808
02:07:18,511 --> 02:07:23,544
MARISHA: Syphilis is intimidating, though.

1809
02:07:25,484 --> 02:07:31,405
MATT: He looks to the rest of the guys. "I don't
know..." There's a moment where the spell comes to

1810
02:07:31,405 --> 02:07:35,562
an end and he goes, "Clever motherfucker."

1811
02:07:35,562 --> 02:07:36,807
MARISHA: Fuck their shit up!

1812
02:07:36,807 --> 02:07:38,178
LIAM: Scorching Rays on that guy!

1813
02:07:38,178 --> 02:07:39,884
LAURA: Spiritual Weapon!

1814
02:07:39,884 --> 02:07:41,206
MARISHA: Fucking punch him in the face!

1815
02:07:41,206 --> 02:07:44,420
TALIESIN: I'm going in the cart.

1816
02:07:44,420 --> 02:07:49,435
MATT: Okay! Okay. Well, they had weapons drawn and
were prepared for something.

1817
02:07:49,435 --> 02:07:50,428
SAM: Sure.

1818
02:07:50,428 --> 02:07:52,007
MATT: This is all going to happen simultaneously.

1819
02:07:52,007 --> 02:07:53,101
LIAM: Yeah, mm-hmm.

1820
02:07:53,101 --> 02:07:56,064
MATT: You're attacking. What are you doing?

1821
02:07:56,064 --> 02:07:57,576
LAURA: The guy that's been talking.

1822
02:07:57,576 --> 02:07:59,823
MATT: Okay. Scorching Ray to the guy who's been
talking as well?

1823
02:07:59,823 --> 02:08:00,832
LIAM: Say again?

1824
02:08:00,832 --> 02:08:02,247
MATT: Scorching Ray to the guy who's been talking
as well?

1825
02:08:02,247 --> 02:08:03,921
LIAM: On the guy I put Friends on, yeah.

1826
02:08:03,921 --> 02:08:04,439
MATT: Okay.

1827
02:08:04,439 --> 02:08:06,724
SAM: Dodge and pick up my weapons.

1828
02:08:09,494 --> 02:08:12,128
TALIESIN: I'm just trying to wait for the first
crossbow bolt, and I'm going to hit them with a

1829
02:08:12,128 --> 02:08:16,444
Vicious Mockery.

1830
02:08:16,444 --> 02:08:17,426
MATT: Okay.

1831
02:08:17,426 --> 02:08:22,263
MARISHA: Yeah, and I'm looking for the first
crossbow bolt that's going to go towards one of my

1832
02:08:22,263 --> 02:08:23,246
friends and try and deflect it.

1833
02:08:23,246 --> 02:08:24,682
MATT: Who are you going to get in front of?

1834
02:08:24,682 --> 02:08:26,709
MARISHA: Am I near Caleb? Who am I near?

1835
02:08:26,709 --> 02:08:30,301
MATT: You're all in a clustered circle; you're in
your camp. Except for Molly, who's--

1836
02:08:30,301 --> 02:08:32,935
MARISHA: I'll protect Caleb. He just pissed them
off.

1837
02:08:32,935 --> 02:08:33,634
MATT: Okay.

1838
02:08:33,634 --> 02:08:34,536
MARISHA: Yeah.

1839
02:08:34,536 --> 02:08:35,614
MATT: Fjord?

1840
02:08:35,614 --> 02:08:37,564
TRAVIS: Yes. I'm firing. Yes. As well.

1841
02:08:37,564 --> 02:08:39,235
MATT: Okay. Towards the main guy?

1842
02:08:39,235 --> 02:08:40,442
TRAVIS: No, another one.

1843
02:08:40,442 --> 02:08:44,523
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make your attack rolls,
please.

1844
02:08:44,523 --> 02:08:47,058
LAURA: Giant purple lollipop.

1845
02:08:47,058 --> 02:08:48,722
MATT: Oh, you're doing Spiritual Weapon.

1846
02:08:48,722 --> 02:08:51,047
MARISHA: You busted out the lollipop?

1847
02:08:51,047 --> 02:08:51,787
LAURA: I did.

1848
02:08:51,787 --> 02:08:56,808
LIAM and MARISHA: (sings) Lollipop, lollipop, ooh
lolli-lolli-lolli, lollipop, lollipop--

1849
02:08:56,808 --> 02:08:58,657
LAURA: Oh god, you guys, keys.

1850
02:08:58,657 --> 02:08:59,971
(cheek popping)

1851
02:08:59,971 --> 02:09:01,873
LIAM and MATT and TALIESIN and TRAVIS: (singing
deeply) Bum bum bum.

1852
02:09:02,463 --> 02:09:05,145
LAURA: Is it plus five? I forget.

1853
02:09:05,145 --> 02:09:05,800
MATT: Yes.

1854
02:09:05,800 --> 02:09:06,723
SAM: It should say.

1855
02:09:06,723 --> 02:09:07,511
LAURA: Okay, yeah, 15.

1856
02:09:07,511 --> 02:09:09,648
MATT: 15? That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

1857
02:09:09,648 --> 02:09:10,536
LAURA: Yes.

1858
02:09:10,536 --> 02:09:12,286
MATT: Caleb, make your attacks for the Scorching
Ray.

1859
02:09:12,286 --> 02:09:14,079
LIAM: Yeah, that's an 18 to hit.

1860
02:09:14,079 --> 02:09:15,680
MATT: Yes. The first one.

1861
02:09:15,680 --> 02:09:16,834
LIAM: Okay. Oh, the first one, right! It's three.

1862
02:09:16,834 --> 02:09:18,255
MATT: Multiple rays.

1863
02:09:18,255 --> 02:09:18,868
LIAM: Yeah, I forget. Sorry, it's a brand new
spell.

1864
02:09:18,868 --> 02:09:19,786
LAURA: Seven points of damage.

1865
02:09:19,786 --> 02:09:21,094
LIAM: Second one is a 24.

1866
02:09:21,094 --> 02:09:21,916
MATT: Hits.

1867
02:09:21,916 --> 02:09:24,463
LIAM: And the third one is a natural 20.

1868
02:09:24,463 --> 02:09:25,458
MATT: All three hit.

1869
02:09:25,458 --> 02:09:36,432
LIAM: Okay. The first is a 11, 12, 13, damn it.
Ja.

1870
02:09:37,462 --> 02:09:39,070
MARISHA: Is that a natural 20 on the--

1871
02:09:39,070 --> 02:09:44,568
LIAM: (Gasps) 37. Total.

1872
02:09:44,568 --> 02:09:45,502
LAURA: What!?

1873
02:09:45,502 --> 02:09:46,233
MATT: 37 points of damage?

1874
02:09:46,233 --> 02:09:47,126
LIAM: Yeah.

1875
02:09:47,126 --> 02:09:48,520
SAM: All on one guy?

1876
02:09:48,520 --> 02:09:49,026
MATT: Yeah.

1877
02:09:49,026 --> 02:09:53,069
LIAM: It was three things of flame go shooting--
Because I did this. (fire noises)

1878
02:09:55,199 --> 02:09:56,467
SAM: Ooh, that's Vax numbers.

1879
02:09:56,467 --> 02:10:01,067
MATT: Immediately as that ray is released. That's
a 16 to hit?

1880
02:10:01,687 --> 02:10:03,296
TRAVIS: (German accent) The fire starter!

1881
02:10:03,296 --> 02:10:04,594
MATT: 21 to hit.

1882
02:10:04,594 --> 02:10:06,442
LIAM: Oh, they're attacking me?

1883
02:10:06,442 --> 02:10:07,043
MATT: Yeah.

1884
02:10:07,043 --> 02:10:08,643
LIAM: They all hit.

1885
02:10:08,643 --> 02:10:09,798
MARISHA: Come on, Duraflame, come on.

1886
02:10:09,798 --> 02:10:10,660
MATT: That's a 19 to hit.

1887
02:10:10,660 --> 02:10:11,483
LIAM: All three hit.

1888
02:10:11,483 --> 02:10:13,146
MATT: And a 12 to hit.

1889
02:10:13,146 --> 02:10:15,253
LIAM: Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

1890
02:10:15,253 --> 02:10:15,845
MATT: Okay.

1891
02:10:16,985 --> 02:10:17,851
LAURA: All at you?

1892
02:10:17,851 --> 02:10:19,940
LIAM: As the flames go out, these come in.

1893
02:10:19,940 --> 02:10:28,664
MATT: As the flames escape, four crossbow bolts:
two of them are heavy, and two of them are light crossbow.

1894
02:10:28,664 --> 02:10:34,099
MARISHA: I was holding my action for that crossbow
bolt. For one at him.

1895
02:10:34,099 --> 02:10:43,159
MATT: Correct. You went to intercede. I'll allow
you to take the hit on that one then. The damage

1896
02:10:43,159 --> 02:10:44,884
goes through to you automatically.

1897
02:10:44,884 --> 02:10:46,705
TALIESIN: Can I Blood Maledict one of them, or
no?

1898
02:10:46,705 --> 02:10:48,158
MATT: I'll allow you to do one of them.

1899
02:10:48,158 --> 02:10:49,165
TALIESIN: Okay.

1900
02:10:49,665 --> 02:10:53,067
MATT: Well, technically I already made the attack
rolls, and you didn't say that.

1901
02:10:53,067 --> 02:10:54,484
TALIESIN: Oh, okay. Never mind.

1902
02:10:54,484 --> 02:10:56,443
MATT: That's okay. That would have been seven
points of piercing damage.

1903
02:10:56,443 --> 02:11:00,380
MARISHA: Yeah, that's a nine, plus seven.

1904
02:11:00,380 --> 02:11:02,727
MATT: You catch one right before it hits Caleb.

1905
02:11:02,727 --> 02:11:04,586
MARISHA: Can I go ahead and burn a ki to go back?

1906
02:11:04,586 --> 02:11:05,135
MATT: You can!

1907
02:11:05,135 --> 02:11:06,840
MARISHA: Bam. Doing that shit.

1908
02:11:06,840 --> 02:11:09,483
MATT: That is a d10, plus your dexterity
modifier.

1909
02:11:10,693 --> 02:11:12,785
MARISHA: d10 plus my dex-- d10?

1910
02:11:12,785 --> 02:11:14,539
MATT: Yeah. It's a heavy crossbow.

1911
02:11:14,539 --> 02:11:16,217
MARISHA: Oh, in terms of damage.

1912
02:11:16,217 --> 02:11:16,764
MATT: Yes.

1913
02:11:16,764 --> 02:11:17,887
MARISHA: Fuck. Yes.

1914
02:11:17,887 --> 02:11:19,731
MATT: Well, you still have to roll to hit, right?
You have to roll to hit back, yeah.

1915
02:11:19,731 --> 02:11:21,546
MARISHA: I think I do, right?

1916
02:11:21,546 --> 02:11:23,550
MATT: Yeah. You're considered proficient, though.

1917
02:11:23,550 --> 02:11:24,524
TRAVIS: Yep.

1918
02:11:24,524 --> 02:11:26,145
MARISHA: That's a 15 naturally.

1919
02:11:26,145 --> 02:11:27,362
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

1920
02:11:27,362 --> 02:11:34,401
MARISHA: And then, so d10. Fuck. That's a fucking
one. Five points of damage. That's lame.

1921
02:11:34,401 --> 02:11:42,303
MATT: Okay. Caleb you do suffer from the bolts
that do make it through to you. 19 points of

1922
02:11:42,303 --> 02:11:43,388
piercing damage.

1923
02:11:43,388 --> 02:11:44,803
LIAM: I have 19 hit points.

1924
02:11:44,803 --> 02:11:48,438
MARISHA: Damn it. If I would've rolled one fucking
higher.

1925
02:11:49,448 --> 02:11:51,253
MATT: (rapid thudding)

1926
02:11:51,253 --> 02:11:54,678
LIAM: (groans and coughs) Syphilis.

1927
02:11:54,678 --> 02:11:59,804
MATT: The last thing you watch is the leader,
who'd been talking with you, gets slammed up in

1928
02:11:59,804 --> 02:12:06,703
the air about two feet with an uppercut from a
mystical lollipop, and then all the rays

1929
02:12:06,703 --> 02:12:14,526
incinerate him into ash in midair. He is scattered
to ash. One of the other guys gets hit with his

1930
02:12:14,526 --> 02:12:17,380
own bolt. Another guy goes blind. What are you
doing?

1931
02:12:17,380 --> 02:12:19,125
TRAVIS: I was Eldritch Blasting him.

1932
02:12:19,125 --> 02:12:20,367
MATT: Against which guy?

1933
02:12:20,367 --> 02:12:21,729
TRAVIS: Just any of them.

1934
02:12:21,729 --> 02:12:22,883
MATT: All right.

1935
02:12:22,883 --> 02:12:24,357
TRAVIS: 19 to hit.

1936
02:12:24,357 --> 02:12:27,264
MATT: 19 to hit works. Go ahead and roll damage.

1937
02:12:29,484 --> 02:12:31,156
TRAVIS: That is 12 points of damage.

1938
02:12:31,156 --> 02:12:37,886
MATT: He gets a blast to the side of the face and
goes down unconscious onto the ground. His

1939
02:12:37,886 --> 02:12:43,017
crossbow fires wide into the air, and disappears
into the night sky. As soon as this happens, as

1940
02:12:43,017 --> 02:12:48,115
you fall unconscious, all these hits happen like
this Mexican standoff that just suddenly-- All

1941
02:12:48,115 --> 02:12:53,272
this action happens at once. Caleb goes down! Two
other guys double over! Two of them go, "Wait,

1942
02:12:53,272 --> 02:12:54,988
wait! Hold on! Hold on!"

1943
02:12:59,468 --> 02:13:02,077
TALIESIN: I pop out of the cart, and I'm holding
the giant glaive.

1944
02:13:02,077 --> 02:13:03,021
MATT: Okay.

1945
02:13:03,021 --> 02:13:05,843
(laughter)

1946
02:13:05,843 --> 02:13:07,949
TALIESIN: I light it up.

1947
02:13:07,949 --> 02:13:09,926
LAURA: Yeah, the sucker's just spinning in the
air.

1948
02:13:09,926 --> 02:13:13,855
MATT: All of a sudden, as the sucker's spinning,
and you watch as this bright burst of radiant

1949
02:13:13,855 --> 02:13:18,999
energy's crackling on the edge of this
nasty-looking, gnollish blade. They're all just

1950
02:13:18,999 --> 02:13:24,092
standing there. "What happened to Trevor?"

1951
02:13:24,092 --> 02:13:26,858
TRAVIS: Oh, Trevor's with the wind.

1952
02:13:26,858 --> 02:13:28,721
LIAM: I just failed my first death save.

1953
02:13:28,721 --> 02:13:29,507
MATT: Okay.

1954
02:13:29,507 --> 02:13:32,260
LAURA: Oh, already? Why'd you roll? He didn't even
tell you.

1955
02:13:32,260 --> 02:13:33,093
LIAM: About six seconds went by.

1956
02:13:33,093 --> 02:13:34,020
LAURA: Jesus.

1957
02:13:34,020 --> 02:13:38,163
TRAVIS: See, Trevor done put his fucking nose
where it didn't belong. Unless you want to join

1958
02:13:38,163 --> 02:13:40,035
him, I'd get the fuck out of here.

1959
02:13:40,035 --> 02:13:46,458
LAURA: I'm going to walk over to Caleb, while I'm
doing this, and I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on him.

1960
02:13:46,458 --> 02:13:47,318
MATT: All right, go for it.

1961
02:13:47,318 --> 02:13:50,506
SAM: (magic sounds)

1962
02:13:50,506 --> 02:13:54,891
TRAVIS: I don't know if you know, but syphilis is
fucking contagious.

1963
02:13:54,891 --> 02:14:00,322
MATT: One of them nearby walks over to where
Trevor was, where his boots on the ground now are

1964
02:14:00,322 --> 02:14:02,899
smoking, and picks up a handful of ash and goes--

1965
02:14:02,899 --> 02:14:03,541
LAURA: 11.

1966
02:14:03,541 --> 02:14:04,131
LIAM: 11, oh, wow. Thank you.

1967
02:14:04,131 --> 02:14:09,151
MATT: "We're going to go ahead and wish you a good
night." (whistles)

1968
02:14:09,151 --> 02:14:09,904
LAURA: Hey, hey!

1969
02:14:09,904 --> 02:14:17,515
LAURA: I think you're going to give us everything
on your cart.

1970
02:14:19,555 --> 02:14:21,514
MATT: "We don't have a cart."

1971
02:14:21,514 --> 02:14:24,727
LAURA: I thought you had a cart; you were going to
load our stuff onto your cart.

1972
02:14:24,727 --> 02:14:26,087
MATT: "No, we were taking your cart."

1973
02:14:26,087 --> 02:14:28,599
LAURA: Oh, well where'd you come from? That's so
stupid.

1974
02:14:28,599 --> 02:14:31,504
TALIESIN: This is a really terrible plan.

1975
02:14:31,504 --> 02:14:35,555
MATT: "Well, we steal your cart and then we get
your stuff and--" "Shut up!" He's like, "I'm sorry."

1976
02:14:35,563 --> 02:14:38,127
LAURA: Well, then give us all your clothes then!

1977
02:14:38,127 --> 02:14:40,550
MARISHA: Yeah, your headbands are lame, but I want
them.

1978
02:14:40,550 --> 02:14:41,770
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

1979
02:14:41,770 --> 02:14:44,020
SAM: I'm going to disappear back into the woods.

1980
02:14:44,050 --> 02:14:51,210
LAURA: That was so close to being good. Five!

1981
02:14:51,210 --> 02:14:53,319
MATT: He goes, "No!"

1982
02:14:54,489 --> 02:15:02,492
TALIESIN: I'm going to say I'm going to use
Devil's Tongue: Come on, we're all friends here.

1983
02:15:02,492 --> 02:15:11,525
Why don't you just walk away, leave your things,
and just admit your defeat? It was a good try.

1984
02:15:11,525 --> 02:15:14,519
MATT: Is this the Vicious Mockery?

1985
02:15:14,519 --> 02:15:17,199
TALIESIN: No, this is not Vicious Mockery. This is
Charm Person.

1986
02:15:17,199 --> 02:15:20,083
MATT: Right! That's a four.

1987
02:15:20,083 --> 02:15:20,983
TALIESIN: Yeah, nope.

1988
02:15:20,983 --> 02:15:27,948
MATT: He goes, "The man makes a valid point," and
starts taking his trousers off immediately in the

1989
02:15:27,948 --> 02:15:32,710
place. All the other guys go (questioning
stutters).

1990
02:15:32,710 --> 02:15:34,897
LAURA: Take it off! Take it all off!

1991
02:15:34,897 --> 02:15:38,544
MATT: They all start pulling and stripping their
armor off. As they take their masks off, you can

1992
02:15:38,544 --> 02:15:50,317
see a lot of them just look like dirty, poor,
wandering brigands. A lot of them are missing

1993
02:15:50,317 --> 02:15:55,575
varying teeth. A lot of them look like they
haven't had a bath in days. They look kind of like Caleb.

1994
02:15:57,461 --> 02:15:59,368
SAM: DM shade.

1995
02:15:59,368 --> 02:16:06,684
MATT: They look genuinely perturbed by the fact
that you incinerated their de facto leader,

1996
02:16:06,684 --> 02:16:12,783
Trevor. There's a moment where they go from these
really frightening nameless thieves to a bunch of

1997
02:16:12,783 --> 02:16:17,544
people that you feel sorry for as they strip down
and throw their armor on the ground. A lot of them

1998
02:16:17,544 --> 02:16:24,382
are left with either just some semblance of slacks
or some sort of tattered long johns that are just

1999
02:16:24,382 --> 02:16:29,992
stained and awful. They throw their crossbows onto
the ground. They throw their shortswords and

2000
02:16:29,992 --> 02:16:31,735
daggers onto the ground.

2001
02:16:31,735 --> 02:16:35,090
TRAVIS: Jester, maybe we can let them have a
little fucking dignity as they leave.

2002
02:16:35,090 --> 02:16:40,853
LIAM: As he says that, I already begin picking
through the remains of the leader's shit, looking

2003
02:16:40,853 --> 02:16:41,740
to see if anything is left.

2004
02:16:41,740 --> 02:16:50,214
MATT: Well, there are two shortswords that are
currently covered in soot, that was once their

2005
02:16:50,214 --> 02:16:55,133
previous owner. All the rest of the armor has been
burnt and charred. And there is ashes.

2006
02:16:55,133 --> 02:17:01,507
SAM: While they're talking, can I do a long circle
around the whole campsite, looking for horses that

2007
02:17:01,507 --> 02:17:02,166
are tied up?

2008
02:17:02,166 --> 02:17:03,607
MATT: Make a perception check.

2009
02:17:03,607 --> 02:17:04,235
SAM: Okay. 19.

2010
02:17:06,485 --> 02:17:12,532
MATT: You do see there are, a ways over the
previous hill, nine horses that are all briefly

2011
02:17:12,532 --> 02:17:15,619
hitched to a few stakes that are pounded into the
ground.

2012
02:17:15,619 --> 02:17:20,814
SAM: I will unhitch the stakes.

2013
02:17:20,814 --> 02:17:21,952
MARISHA: Oh, yes you will.

2014
02:17:24,482 --> 02:17:32,114
SAM: Let's see here. Five of them I'll just shoo,
the meekest five I'll shoo off into the woods and

2015
02:17:32,114 --> 02:17:36,336
the other four I'll try to control and take with
me somewhere else.

2016
02:17:36,336 --> 02:17:38,373
MATT: Make an animal handling check.

2017
02:17:39,513 --> 02:17:44,157
SAM: 18 plus something! Plus three-- No, plus
zero.

2018
02:17:44,167 --> 02:17:52,222
MATT: You have been learning, as you've made your
way past these barriers with nature's beautiful,

2019
02:17:52,228 --> 02:17:57,038
natural creatures. Manage to get four sets of
these reins, and these horses look pretty

2020
02:17:57,038 --> 02:18:00,499
malnourished, and they were probably stolen too.
Some of them have brands, but different types of

2021
02:18:00,499 --> 02:18:05,719
brands. You get the sense that they were probably
pulled from different homesteads. As you pull them

2022
02:18:05,719 --> 02:18:09,003
together, there's a moment of you waiting for them
to draw and quarter you. Just based on what you're

2023
02:18:09,003 --> 02:18:15,017
holding. Just like (yelps). But they follow. You
carefully begin to walk a perimeter around. While

2024
02:18:15,017 --> 02:18:15,892
that's happening--

2025
02:18:15,892 --> 02:18:21,143
TALIESIN: Now that the leader's dead, who's the de
facto leader here? Speak up, be bold!

2026
02:18:21,143 --> 02:18:25,984
MATT: Two of the ones go, "Me!" They both look at
each other and shoot each other down with these

2027
02:18:25,984 --> 02:18:30,048
horrible glares and go, "No, it's me!" again, at
the same time. Both say, "Fuck you!" at the same

2028
02:18:30,048 --> 02:18:32,508
time. (Groans) And they're just frustrated.

2029
02:18:32,508 --> 02:18:35,903
TALIESIN: Do you know parchment-shears-stone?

2030
02:18:35,903 --> 02:18:36,675
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2031
02:18:36,675 --> 02:18:39,504
ALL: Boulder-parchment-shears.

2032
02:18:39,504 --> 02:18:39,987
TALIESIN: Do you know that game?

2033
02:18:39,987 --> 02:18:41,056
MATT: "Yeah."

2034
02:18:41,056 --> 02:18:41,411
TALIESIN: Pick your leader.

2035
02:18:41,411 --> 02:18:43,186
MARISHA: Do it! Come on.

2036
02:18:43,186 --> 02:18:46,135
MATT: They both come together and (tapping).

2037
02:18:46,135 --> 02:18:47,826
LIAM: Kiss yourself, Matthew.

2038
02:18:52,496 --> 02:19:03,842
MATT: All right, the one on the left, who looks to
be a scraggly redhead, probably close to 20 or

2039
02:19:03,842 --> 02:19:08,738
21 years old, wins the bout of
boulder-parchment-shears.

2040
02:19:08,738 --> 02:19:15,203
TALIESIN: Step forward. Would you agree that the
previous leadership of this group has probably

2041
02:19:15,209 --> 02:19:18,337
failed you on some level?

2042
02:19:18,337 --> 02:19:21,949
MATT: "You know, I wouldn't say so. Yeah, no, I
mean, Trevor, he--"

2043
02:19:21,949 --> 02:19:24,188
TALIESIN: Look where you are right now, son.

2044
02:19:24,188 --> 02:19:26,333
MATT: "I know! Trevor's turned to ashes."

2045
02:19:26,333 --> 02:19:27,671
TALIESIN: It was a bad decision!

2046
02:19:27,671 --> 02:19:28,055
MATT: "It was very bad. He was a very bad man."

2047
02:19:28,055 --> 02:19:28,613
TALIESIN: Perhaps you should rethink your line of
work.

2048
02:19:28,613 --> 02:19:38,687
MATT: "Yeah. Yeah, you're right. You are right.
Right?" And all the boys go, "Right."

2049
02:19:38,687 --> 02:19:41,475
TRAVIS: Molly I think they also need a bath.

2050
02:19:41,475 --> 02:19:44,825
TALIESIN: Right. All right here's the deal, if
everyone's fine?

2051
02:19:44,825 --> 02:19:45,832
MARISHA: Yeah.

2052
02:19:45,832 --> 02:19:46,332
MATT: "Are you going to bathe me?"

2053
02:19:46,332 --> 02:19:47,341
TALIESIN: Maybe.

2054
02:19:47,341 --> 02:19:48,407
MATT: (whimpers)

2055
02:19:48,407 --> 02:19:54,406
TALIESIN: Put your clothes back on, this is just
embarrassing, all of you-- don't pick up your weapons--

2056
02:19:54,463 --> 02:19:55,803
LAURA: Leave your weapons.

2057
02:19:55,803 --> 02:20:02,031
MATT: They start taking their clothes and the one
who this one kid beat at boulder-parchment-shears

2058
02:20:02,031 --> 02:20:03,585
is like, "You fucked up, Zenny."

2059
02:20:03,585 --> 02:20:10,552
TALIESIN: Do not criticize new management until
it's had time to take full effect.

2060
02:20:10,552 --> 02:20:11,407
MATT: "Right."

2061
02:20:14,067 --> 02:20:14,907
TALIESIN: All right?

2062
02:20:15,327 --> 02:20:19,816
MATT: They all start putting on bits of their
clothing, most of them are just holding it under

2063
02:20:19,816 --> 02:20:20,815
their arms.

2064
02:20:20,815 --> 02:20:21,315
TALIESIN: Now, line up. Line up.

2065
02:20:21,315 --> 02:20:22,151
LAURA: How many are there?

2066
02:20:22,151 --> 02:20:25,046
TALIESIN: Nine. Eight.

2067
02:20:25,046 --> 02:20:34,536
MATT: There's eight now and three of them look
like they're hurting pretty bad. One of them has

2068
02:20:34,536 --> 02:20:37,289
their own crossbow bolt in their chest that Beau
threw and it's still there and he's (groans)

2069
02:20:37,289 --> 02:20:39,179
holding it.

2070
02:20:42,439 --> 02:20:46,411
TALIESIN: Now you're all going to leave tonight.
You're going to find something better to do with

2071
02:20:46,411 --> 02:20:52,297
yourselves and remember, no matter how you die or
where we can identify your bodies without the

2072
02:20:52,297 --> 02:20:59,187
heads. So be careful. I'm going to give, in a
line, one gold piece each to each of them in the row.

2073
02:20:59,187 --> 02:21:01,816
TRAVIS: Yes, that's, yes. I like that a lot.

2074
02:21:01,816 --> 02:21:03,492
MATT: They all look very confused.

2075
02:21:03,492 --> 02:21:09,361
TALIESIN: Now for this, you promise that your
terrible bandit days are over because you're

2076
02:21:09,361 --> 02:21:14,617
really not very good at this. I mean, we were
barely paying attention, this is pathetic.

2077
02:21:14,617 --> 02:21:17,791
MARISHA: Well, you were barely paying attention.

2078
02:21:17,791 --> 02:21:22,273
TALIESIN: Well let's not cast aspirations on new
management, it's only been two days.

2079
02:21:22,273 --> 02:21:27,626
MATT: They all lower their heads and one of them
goes, "Yeah, Zenny." He's like, "Shut up."

2080
02:21:27,626 --> 02:21:30,893
TALIESIN: You're all walking away with one gold.

2081
02:21:30,893 --> 02:21:33,995
MATT: "Right." "Right." "Right." "Right."

2082
02:21:33,995 --> 02:21:38,533
(laughter)

2083
02:21:38,533 --> 02:21:40,840
TALIESIN: That's about as well as this night
could've gone for you.

2084
02:21:40,840 --> 02:21:45,709
LAURA: Make sure you wash your gold thoroughly
because they're all infected with syphilis.

2085
02:21:45,709 --> 02:21:46,733
TALIESIN: There's so much syphilis.

2086
02:21:46,733 --> 02:21:52,529
MATT: Two of them drop the coins on the ground and
then pick them up again, but with bits of their cloth.

2087
02:21:52,546 --> 02:21:56,579
MARISHA: Molly, if I will, I feel like our money
should still buy something, you know, a service.

2088
02:21:56,579 --> 02:22:02,316
We teach these good men to make money based on the
services they provide.

2089
02:22:02,316 --> 02:22:05,086
TALIESIN: What precisely did you have in mind?

2090
02:22:05,086 --> 02:22:12,710
MARISHA: You all have one fucking job, you go and
you tell all your stupid friends: No fucks with

2091
02:22:12,710 --> 02:22:14,736
the Mighty Nein.

2092
02:22:18,498 --> 02:22:24,686
MATT: You see as three of them are, quietly under
their breath, "Mighty Nein, Mighty Nein, okay."

2093
02:22:24,686 --> 02:22:30,135
MARISHA: But spelled N-E-I-N. The Mighty Nein.
Don't forget it.

2094
02:22:30,135 --> 02:22:32,090
MATT: It's at that moment you think you've lost
most of them.

2095
02:22:32,730 --> 02:22:36,483
LIAM: It's in Zemnian. Partially.

2096
02:22:36,483 --> 02:22:38,881
TALIESIN: I mean, unless anyone else has anything
to say?

2097
02:22:38,881 --> 02:22:39,371
MARISHA: That's all I got.

2098
02:22:39,371 --> 02:22:40,674
TALIESIN: Okay.

2099
02:22:40,674 --> 02:22:47,475
LAURA: The Traveler is with you all, forever and
ever (low-pitched) and ever.

2100
02:22:48,435 --> 02:22:56,129
MATT: Use Thaumaturgy to make that, "(low-pitched)
And ever!" You Gandalf-voice it for a moment and

2101
02:22:56,129 --> 02:23:03,416
they all take a step back, "So, leader Zenny,
where are we off to?" He's like, "Um, I think,

2102
02:23:03,416 --> 02:23:05,860
let's just head to Felderwin."

2103
02:23:05,860 --> 02:23:07,862
TALIESIN: That's a very bold decision, well done.

2104
02:23:07,862 --> 02:23:10,161
MATT: "Okay. Thank you."

2105
02:23:10,161 --> 02:23:11,293
TALIESIN: You're welcome.

2106
02:23:11,293 --> 02:23:13,579
LAURA: Go away now!

2107
02:23:13,579 --> 02:23:18,148
MATT: "Okay!" They all quickly dart off, they're
pulling their pants up the rest of the way and

2108
02:23:18,148 --> 02:23:24,706
they're making their way back into the field.
They're avoiding-- yeah, you've certainly made

2109
02:23:24,706 --> 02:23:25,695
their evening.

2110
02:23:25,695 --> 02:23:30,333
LAURA: Oh man, did you see that you thought you
burned that other guy up, did you see how much you

2111
02:23:30,333 --> 02:23:31,154
burned that--

2112
02:23:31,154 --> 02:23:35,190
LIAM: (groans in pain)

2113
02:23:35,190 --> 02:23:36,854
MARISHA: Sorry, I caught one of them.

2114
02:23:36,854 --> 02:23:40,133
(laughter)

2115
02:23:40,133 --> 02:23:44,008
LIAM: Two-- (groans in pain)

2116
02:23:44,008 --> 02:23:49,490
LAURA: That's really good. I just go up and put a
hand on each of them to cover the blood holes.

2117
02:23:49,490 --> 02:23:51,010
LIAM: Oh, cover my nips.

2118
02:23:51,010 --> 02:23:54,637
TALIESIN: I'm going to gather the swords and the
crossbows and put them in the cart.

2119
02:23:54,637 --> 02:23:59,020
LAURA: I don't have any more hands, Caleb, don't
do it, don't do it. Oh no! I put my knee up on the

2120
02:23:59,020 --> 02:24:06,498
hole. Stop it. I'm going to cure your wounds now.
Get ready for it, it's going to be so good.

2121
02:24:06,498 --> 02:24:08,343
LIAM: I think I'm going to faint right now.

2122
02:24:08,343 --> 02:24:09,602
LAURA: No! Cure Wounds!

2123
02:24:12,482 --> 02:24:17,819
MARISHA: He's all right. He'll be fine. He's going
to feel great when he wakes up.

2124
02:24:17,819 --> 02:24:19,322
TRAVIS: Yeah, like a million bucks.

2125
02:24:19,322 --> 02:24:27,202
LAURA: That one isn't as good, that's only four.
Sorry. You pulled out all three of them at once,

2126
02:24:27,202 --> 02:24:28,059
you know.

2127
02:24:29,479 --> 02:24:30,673
TALIESIN: Well hey, more kindling.

2128
02:24:30,673 --> 02:24:35,370
MATT: You guys eventually settle yourselves down
to continue your evening of rest.

2129
02:24:35,370 --> 02:24:40,682
SAM: I walk back into camp with the horses and tie
them up. I found some horses.

2130
02:24:40,682 --> 02:24:41,576
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

2131
02:24:41,576 --> 02:24:47,986
SAM: I named them: Loo, John, Crapper, and
Toilet.

2132
02:24:47,986 --> 02:24:52,542
LAURA: Woah. I'll take Toilet.

2133
02:24:52,542 --> 02:24:54,174
MARISHA: I take Crapper.

2134
02:24:54,174 --> 02:24:55,193
TRAVIS: I'll take John.

2135
02:24:55,193 --> 02:24:56,138
TALIESIN: I'll take Loo.

2136
02:24:58,468 --> 02:25:05,981
MATT: All right. Keep in mind now that you're
having to feed and take of six horses.

2137
02:25:08,491 --> 02:25:15,472
LAURA: Okay. I feed Toilet so many doughnuts, I
just feed him so many.

2138
02:25:15,472 --> 02:25:17,037
MATT: You're running pretty low on doughnuts, by
the way.

2139
02:25:17,037 --> 02:25:22,192
LAURA: I know, it's crumbs and moldy bits of
pastry at the bottom of my bag now.

2140
02:25:22,192 --> 02:25:25,435
MATT: Yeah. They didn't start as lemon tarts.

2141
02:25:25,435 --> 02:25:28,702
LAURA: I had, like, twelve stuffed in there.

2142
02:25:28,702 --> 02:25:31,911
TALIESIN: It's 2:00AM on a Sunday at a Starbucks
right now. There's nothing.

2143
02:25:31,911 --> 02:25:32,931
MATT: Basically, yeah.

2144
02:25:32,931 --> 02:25:34,544
MARISHA: One lone cake pop.

2145
02:25:35,464 --> 02:25:40,613
LAURA: I'm out of pastries. I'm out of money and
I'm out of pastries.

2146
02:25:40,613 --> 02:25:41,451
SAM: Money?

2147
02:25:41,451 --> 02:25:44,779
LAURA: Well, compared to what I had, this is
bullshit.

2148
02:25:46,479 --> 02:25:47,814
SAM: What did you have before?

2149
02:25:47,814 --> 02:25:53,370
LAURA: I don't know, it was a pretty big pile
though. This is like not a big pile, this was like

2150
02:25:53,370 --> 02:25:54,427
a big pile.

2151
02:25:54,427 --> 02:25:55,941
SAM: When you were with your mother?

2152
02:25:55,941 --> 02:25:56,647
LAURA: Yeah!

2153
02:25:58,487 --> 02:26:01,261
TALIESIN: I don't even know what you do with that
much money, this is ridiculous.

2154
02:26:01,261 --> 02:26:06,703
LAURA: You buy clothes for your horse that draws
your carriage, which is something I did.

2155
02:26:06,703 --> 02:26:09,702
TALIESIN: You put clothes on your horse? That's a
great idea.

2156
02:26:09,702 --> 02:26:10,795
LAURA: It was real pretty.

2157
02:26:10,795 --> 02:26:12,996
MARISHA: What happened to those clothes and that
horse?

2158
02:26:12,996 --> 02:26:20,235
LAURA: Well, I think I left them on the side of
the road, somewhere, actually.

2159
02:26:20,235 --> 02:26:21,609
TALIESIN: Insight check.

2160
02:26:21,609 --> 02:26:22,518
LAURA: Why did I do that?

2161
02:26:22,518 --> 02:26:24,286
TALIESIN: Is she full of bullshit?

2162
02:26:24,286 --> 02:26:25,508
MATT: Make an insight check.

2163
02:26:25,508 --> 02:26:29,420
TALIESIN: All right. 12.

2164
02:26:29,420 --> 02:26:30,982
MATT: Hard to read.

2165
02:26:30,982 --> 02:26:32,390
TALIESIN: Damn it.

2166
02:26:34,210 --> 02:26:39,165
LAURA: I can't remember. I saw something super
interesting. Shit.

2167
02:26:39,165 --> 02:26:41,943
TALIESIN: If it was that interesting, why can't
you remember it?

2168
02:26:41,943 --> 02:26:44,224
LAURA: I see a lot of interesting things.

2169
02:26:44,224 --> 02:26:45,125
TALIESIN: That's fair.

2170
02:26:45,125 --> 02:26:48,277
MARISHA: I bet that horse made a great gift for
someone else, you probably made somebody really

2171
02:26:48,277 --> 02:26:52,610
happy. Maybe a little girl who wanted a horsie for
her birthday.

2172
02:26:52,610 --> 02:26:56,750
TRAVIS: I start kicking the ash of the former
leader around to spread him around and fucking lay

2173
02:26:56,750 --> 02:26:57,660
back down.

2174
02:26:57,660 --> 02:26:58,814
SAM: Caleb's still out.

2175
02:26:58,814 --> 02:27:02,220
TALIESIN: How many sword and crossbows and random
things did we pick up?

2176
02:27:03,470 --> 02:27:04,723
MATT: Two heavy crossbows.

2177
02:27:04,723 --> 02:27:05,975
TALIESIN: Two heavy crossbows.

2178
02:27:07,445 --> 02:27:09,368
MATT: Three light crossbows.

2179
02:27:09,368 --> 02:27:11,790
TALIESIN: Two heavy cross-- Oh you've got--?
Yeah.

2180
02:27:11,790 --> 02:27:13,224
LAURA: Two heavy--

2181
02:27:13,224 --> 02:27:14,027
TALIESIN: Two light.

2182
02:27:14,027 --> 02:27:18,851
SAM: This is not a good system. Travis, will you
teach her how to keep track of our group stuff?

2183
02:27:18,851 --> 02:27:22,688
TRAVIS: Nope. Trust me, my system wasn't any
better.

2184
02:27:22,688 --> 02:27:25,765
LAURA: I'm going to make better notes soon, I'm
just going to-- Two heavy crossbows, two light--

2185
02:27:27,485 --> 02:27:29,011
MATT: Two hand crossbows.

2186
02:27:29,011 --> 02:27:32,011
LAURA: That's in addition to the two light
crossbows?

2187
02:27:32,011 --> 02:27:33,377
TALIESIN: Two heavy, two light, two hand.

2188
02:27:33,377 --> 02:27:34,110
LAURA: Two hand.

2189
02:27:35,730 --> 02:27:38,319
SAM: It's like, all over the place next to dick
pics.

2190
02:27:40,739 --> 02:27:44,242
MATT: What would amount to 43 bolts.

2191
02:27:46,482 --> 02:27:48,484
SAM: Oh, I'll take some of those.

2192
02:27:48,484 --> 02:27:50,469
MATT: Yeah, those will be helpful to you.

2193
02:27:50,469 --> 02:27:52,017
LAURA: Do you want all of them?

2194
02:27:53,507 --> 02:27:55,531
SAM: No, because what if we need-- someone else--

2195
02:27:55,531 --> 02:27:58,083
LAURA: No one else is going to use crossbows.

2196
02:27:58,083 --> 02:28:00,394
SAM: I'll take 20.

2197
02:28:00,394 --> 02:28:01,827
LAURA: 20, got it.

2198
02:28:05,487 --> 02:28:09,529
MATT: And six shortswords and two daggers.

2199
02:28:09,529 --> 02:28:10,649
LAURA: Holy moly.

2200
02:28:12,519 --> 02:28:15,354
MATT: You can load up in that cart. Carrying them
on your person would be a problem, that cart's

2201
02:28:15,354 --> 02:28:17,938
getting pretty full. Thankfully you have more
horses.

2202
02:28:18,698 --> 02:28:20,192
LAURA: Two daggers you said?

2203
02:28:20,192 --> 02:28:21,627
TRAVIS: We've got the fucking Wells Fargo carriage
now.

2204
02:28:21,627 --> 02:28:23,492
MARISHA: Oh my god, it totally is!

2205
02:28:23,492 --> 02:28:25,703
TRAVIS: We're straight-up Wells Fargo.

2206
02:28:25,703 --> 02:28:30,807
MATT: Mind you, all the equipment you found from
them, not in the best condition. The swords are

2207
02:28:30,807 --> 02:28:36,332
dinged to shit. They're chipped in places like
they've been banged against hard pieces.

2208
02:28:37,007 --> 02:28:40,753
MARISHA: Scrap metal. I roll Caleb over and make
sure he's not face-down in the dirt.

2209
02:28:40,753 --> 02:28:42,116
MATT: He's breathing, he's good.

2210
02:28:42,116 --> 02:28:43,528
MARISHA: I cover him up, he's fine.

2211
02:28:43,528 --> 02:28:50,689
MATT: You guys eventually find yourselves back to
rest for the evening. You're keeping second watch now?

2212
02:28:50,689 --> 02:28:51,902
LAURA: He was going to keep second watch.

2213
02:28:51,902 --> 02:28:52,693
SAM: Yes, I'm second watch.

2214
02:28:52,693 --> 02:28:56,490
MATT: Nott, go ahead and roll a perception check
for me, please.

2215
02:28:56,490 --> 02:28:57,747
SAM: Oh man, eight.

2216
02:28:57,747 --> 02:29:00,037
MATT: Okay.

2217
02:29:00,037 --> 02:29:01,645
LIAM: Take them out! Take them out!

2218
02:29:01,645 --> 02:29:03,053
LAURA: Jesus Christ.

2219
02:29:03,053 --> 02:29:11,281
LIAM: (heavy panting) Oh, you're all awake.

2220
02:29:11,281 --> 02:29:12,379
SAM: Hello.

2221
02:29:12,379 --> 02:29:14,699
LAURA: Now we are all awake.

2222
02:29:14,699 --> 02:29:17,222
SAM: Were you having a bad dream?

2223
02:29:17,222 --> 02:29:18,916
TALIESIN: Party's over.

2224
02:29:18,916 --> 02:29:19,897
LIAM: Why would you say that?

2225
02:29:19,897 --> 02:29:23,530
MARISHA: One day we're going to have a real big
talk about your issues.

2226
02:29:24,750 --> 02:29:29,124
LAURA: You have major glasses indentations on your
face.

2227
02:29:29,124 --> 02:29:30,915
LIAM: I don't wear glasses.

2228
02:29:30,915 --> 02:29:33,655
LAURA: Then what the fuck is that from?

2229
02:29:33,655 --> 02:29:36,394
TRAVIS: Yeah, the syphilis is creeping up into
your eye cavities.

2230
02:29:36,394 --> 02:29:43,420
SAM: That was some good lying. Oh boy. Your face
is fucked up.

2231
02:29:43,420 --> 02:29:46,025
(laughter)

2232
02:29:46,025 --> 02:29:47,517
TRAVIS: Look over here. Holy shit.

2233
02:29:49,467 --> 02:29:51,451
LAURA: That's commitment.

2234
02:29:51,451 --> 02:29:57,164
LIAM: I've been asleep face-down in the cart, it
feels like. Where are we?

2235
02:29:57,164 --> 02:30:00,177
SAM: We're in the same exact place, you're not
dead.

2236
02:30:00,177 --> 02:30:02,318
LIAM: Did we make it to Zadash?

2237
02:30:02,318 --> 02:30:05,739
LAURA: No, Caleb go back to sleep, you're ruining
everyone's sleep.

2238
02:30:05,739 --> 02:30:07,202
MARISHA: Yeah, it's literally been about ten
minutes.

2239
02:30:07,202 --> 02:30:12,697
LIAM: Okay, let's fight these fuckers. Where are
they?

2240
02:30:12,697 --> 02:30:15,825
SAM: They're all dead, they're gone. We took their
horses, they're gone.

2241
02:30:15,825 --> 02:30:23,210
LAURA: They were already gone when you passed out.
Go back to sleep. Is he always like this?

2242
02:30:23,210 --> 02:30:24,376
SAM: Yes!

2243
02:30:24,376 --> 02:30:25,424
LAURA: Oi.

2244
02:30:25,424 --> 02:30:26,503
SAM: He's very smart.

2245
02:30:26,503 --> 02:30:29,521
MATT: All right. Third and final watch?

2246
02:30:29,521 --> 02:30:30,439
LAURA: Yes.

2247
02:30:30,439 --> 02:30:31,472
MATT: Go for it.

2248
02:30:31,472 --> 02:30:35,966
SAM: Good wrist action, terrible roll.

2249
02:30:35,966 --> 02:30:36,931
TALIESIN: Wow!

2250
02:30:36,931 --> 02:30:38,491
TRAVIS: Please tell me it's less than a ten.

2251
02:30:38,491 --> 02:30:39,597
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

2252
02:30:39,597 --> 02:30:40,627
LAURA: It's six.

2253
02:30:40,627 --> 02:30:46,110
TRAVIS: I mean, that's six perception checks in a
row that were under ten.

2254
02:30:46,110 --> 02:30:52,623
MATT: Yeah. During your final watch, as people are
finishing up their rest, the sun just barely

2255
02:30:52,623 --> 02:30:58,009
begins to-- or would be cresting over the hills.
The slight change in light is the precursor that

2256
02:30:58,009 --> 02:31:04,457
notifies you of dawn, however, the heavy, dark
clouds in the sky and the sudden sound of thunder

2257
02:31:04,457 --> 02:31:09,933
immediately followed the freezing cold rainfall
that begins to spill across the entirety of your

2258
02:31:09,933 --> 02:31:13,586
campsite. All of you begin to come to
consciousness, finishing your long rest, by

2259
02:31:13,586 --> 02:31:20,291
immediately being drenched in freezing water of a
recent storm here on the Marrow Valley fields.

2260
02:31:20,291 --> 02:31:22,636
LAURA: Hey you guys, it's raining.

2261
02:31:22,636 --> 02:31:23,761
TALIESIN: Are you sure?

2262
02:31:23,761 --> 02:31:24,637
LAURA: Yeah.

2263
02:31:24,637 --> 02:31:25,941
TALIESIN: Have you checked?

2264
02:31:25,941 --> 02:31:26,692
LAURA: Yeah.

2265
02:31:26,692 --> 02:31:28,058
TALIESIN: Hold on.

2266
02:31:28,058 --> 02:31:29,433
MARISHA: Camping sucks.

2267
02:31:29,433 --> 02:31:37,211
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's rain. That's a little
water. I'm going to fold my coat up and put it

2268
02:31:37,453 --> 02:31:40,493
away, just vest and vestiture.

2269
02:31:40,493 --> 02:31:42,896
TRAVIS: I take out that heavy cloak and I put it
over my damn head.

2270
02:31:42,896 --> 02:31:50,523
MATT: Okay. you guys all bundle up what you can.
The horses are trying to stay warm and cuddle up

2271
02:31:50,523 --> 02:31:52,334
next to each other.

2272
02:31:52,334 --> 02:31:54,445
LAURA: I take my cloak off and put it around
Toilet's head.

2273
02:31:54,445 --> 02:31:55,586
MARISHA: Aww!

2274
02:31:55,586 --> 02:31:57,037
LAURA: See?

2275
02:31:57,037 --> 02:32:04,526
MATT: I'm not going to talk about the state of the
manticore head at the moment, which is now

2276
02:32:04,526 --> 02:32:06,342
drenched in rain.

2277
02:32:06,342 --> 02:32:08,144
LAURA: The cold weather will be good for it.

2278
02:32:12,444 --> 02:32:16,427
MATT: You guys you have rested for the evening.
you continue back onto the path and continue

2279
02:32:16,427 --> 02:32:24,361
forward. Who's keeping watch on this next journey?
Perception check for me, please.

2280
02:32:28,246 --> 02:32:29,624
LIAM: It's a 12.

2281
02:32:33,734 --> 02:32:42,010
MATT: You glance off the side of the western edge
of the Amber Road and see a neglected gravesite,

2282
02:32:42,010 --> 02:32:51,620
maybe 300 feet off the road's path. It's overgrown
in the fields. At a quick glance, you can gather

2283
02:32:51,620 --> 02:32:59,255
maybe close to 200 various stones that are grave
markers in various states of disrepair and erosion

2284
02:32:59,255 --> 02:33:09,174
over time. As you ride past and see in the
distance, it looks to be an older landmark, that's

2285
02:33:09,174 --> 02:33:11,235
been left to be reclaimed by nature.

2286
02:33:11,235 --> 02:33:14,655
LIAM: At our closest, where do we get to it before
passing it?

2287
02:33:14,655 --> 02:33:18,313
MATT: You'd probably get about 80 or 90 feet from
it.

2288
02:33:18,313 --> 02:33:20,131
LIAM: Is everybody sleeping?

2289
02:33:20,131 --> 02:33:22,760
MATT: No, everyone's up in the cart, or riding.

2290
02:33:28,470 --> 02:33:29,560
LIAM: Okay.

2291
02:33:30,470 --> 02:33:36,412
MATT: You guys continue on past, up the road. Are
you still keeping watch on this?

2292
02:33:36,412 --> 02:33:41,722
LIAM: Am I controlling the cart at this point if
everybody is sleeping?

2293
02:33:41,722 --> 02:33:44,730
LAURA: We're all on horses.

2294
02:33:44,730 --> 02:33:46,953
LIAM: We're all just going, and I'm keeping
watch?

2295
02:33:46,953 --> 02:33:53,413
LAURA: Nott might be driving the cart, you might
be sitting in the cart, but the rest of us are on

2296
02:33:53,413 --> 02:33:54,932
horses next to the cart.

2297
02:33:54,932 --> 02:33:58,389
LIAM: Wait, wait. I want to--

2298
02:33:58,389 --> 02:34:01,679
SAM: Whoa!

2299
02:34:01,679 --> 02:34:07,741
LIAM: I just have to take a piss, hold on. I'm
going to walk over towards the graves.

2300
02:34:07,741 --> 02:34:11,387
SAM: It's true, he does need to pee quite
frequently.

2301
02:34:11,387 --> 02:34:13,524
TALIESIN: There's an old cemetery?

2302
02:34:13,524 --> 02:34:19,641
MATT: You glance over to where he's going to pee
and you can see a long in disuse cemetery.

2303
02:34:19,641 --> 02:34:25,325
LIAM: I would like to get about 30 or 40 feet
within range of it and start taking a tinkle.

2304
02:34:25,325 --> 02:34:26,881
MATT: Okay.

2305
02:34:26,881 --> 02:34:30,413
TALIESIN: I'm going to crawl over there on my
horse as well and get a feel of it.

2306
02:34:30,413 --> 02:34:37,912
MATT: Okay. As you're finishing your business, you
can get within 30 feet or so and you see that a

2307
02:34:37,912 --> 02:34:43,372
lot of the stones are intact, some of them have
been cracked and broken, a lot of them-- what once

2308
02:34:43,372 --> 02:34:50,493
may have been a well-kept perimeter of earth,
dirt, and dust has since been completely retaken

2309
02:34:50,493 --> 02:34:54,710
by the grasses of the field. While the grasses
aren't as tall as the surrounding field may be,

2310
02:34:54,710 --> 02:35:00,887
the greenery and the moss has taken a lot of the
stone and to read a lot of them you would probably

2311
02:35:00,887 --> 02:35:04,801
have to clear off whatever bit of growth has
reached up and claimed them.

2312
02:35:04,801 --> 02:35:07,173
TALIESIN: I'm going to pick a random one.

2313
02:35:07,173 --> 02:35:13,926
LIAM: After I shake it and put it away, I move my
fingers in a shape in the air and whisper a few

2314
02:35:13,926 --> 02:35:17,881
arcane words and cast Detect Magic within range of
the gravestones.

2315
02:35:17,881 --> 02:35:26,493
MATT: Okay. As you begin to do a conscious pass
across the grave, nothing magical catches your

2316
02:35:26,493 --> 02:35:28,690
attention within the radius you're observing.

2317
02:35:28,690 --> 02:35:32,292
LIAM: Okay. I squeeze out a single fart and go
back to the cart.

2318
02:35:32,292 --> 02:35:34,229
TALIESIN: Anything undead, anything...?

2319
02:35:34,229 --> 02:35:37,117
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2320
02:35:42,277 --> 02:35:43,278
TRAVIS: Nein!

2321
02:35:43,278 --> 02:35:45,199
TALIESIN: With advantage, or no?

2322
02:35:45,199 --> 02:35:47,816
MATT: As you're seeking anything that's related to
the undead, yeah, go for it.

2323
02:35:49,476 --> 02:35:50,669
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

2324
02:35:50,669 --> 02:35:52,153
MATT: Okay.

2325
02:35:52,153 --> 02:35:53,951
TALIESIN: I'm cleaning off one.

2326
02:35:53,951 --> 02:36:02,329
MATT: As you pick one and look for any signs of
grave emerging or grave robbery, or different

2327
02:36:02,329 --> 02:36:06,840
things that may be attributed to the necromantic
studies that involve the creation and/or

2328
02:36:06,840 --> 02:36:16,581
maintenance of undead, the site seems to be
largely undisturbed. You go through one name and

2329
02:36:16,581 --> 02:36:24,062
it says "Bagent" and the next once you go by says
"Avryn" and the next stone says "Emor." The

2330
02:36:24,062 --> 02:36:28,276
markings are simple. They're very simple stones.
It looks like whoever was buried here was done so

2331
02:36:28,276 --> 02:36:36,089
at the very basic level of marking a grave site.
Your foot hits something hard on the ground and

2332
02:36:36,089 --> 02:36:45,544
your toe-- and you look down at a rusted helmet of
iron make. You pick it up. Make a history check.

2333
02:36:45,544 --> 02:36:47,739
MARISHA: (whisper chants) Scrap metal! Scrap
metal! Scrap metal!

2334
02:36:47,739 --> 02:36:50,271
TRAVIS: Like nobody's going to want metal and
we're just going to be driving around that busted

2335
02:36:50,271 --> 02:36:51,983
jalopy with a shitload of metal.

2336
02:36:51,983 --> 02:36:53,127
TALIESIN: Nothing. Six.

2337
02:36:54,467 --> 02:37:00,567
MATT: You're unable to make out any details of the
construction of it or any significance of it, but

2338
02:37:00,567 --> 02:37:05,186
it's an old helmet. And it looks like a lot of the
edges of it appear to have just slowly been taken

2339
02:37:05,186 --> 02:37:07,471
by the oxidization--

2340
02:37:07,471 --> 02:37:08,836
TALIESIN: I'm going to take it back anyway.

2341
02:37:08,836 --> 02:37:13,540
MATT: As you guys are waiting, Caleb's returned,
and a few minutes later, maybe about ten minutes

2342
02:37:13,540 --> 02:37:20,202
after, you watch as Molly approaches, tossing this
deeply rusted iron helmet in his hand.

2343
02:37:20,202 --> 02:37:21,684
LIAM: What is that? Can I see that?

2344
02:37:21,684 --> 02:37:22,345
TALIESIN: Of course.

2345
02:37:22,345 --> 02:37:25,804
LIAM: Yeah, I would like to. Do I recognize this?

2346
02:37:25,804 --> 02:37:27,370
MATT: Make a history check.

2347
02:37:27,370 --> 02:37:28,439
LIAM: Yeah.

2348
02:37:28,439 --> 02:37:29,371
SAM: It's Yorick.

2349
02:37:29,371 --> 02:37:35,535
LIAM: Yeah. That is a 14.

2350
02:37:35,535 --> 02:37:42,512
MATT: Okay. You have a little more grasp and
understanding of the history of the valley. The

2351
02:37:42,512 --> 02:37:48,052
markings on this indicate that this helmet
belonged to a regiment of the Julous Dominion. The

2352
02:37:48,052 --> 02:37:58,614
Julous Dominion, which you recall is the last
remaining empire to be conquered by the Dwendalian

2353
02:37:58,614 --> 02:38:02,029
Empire, nearly two centuries before.

2354
02:38:02,029 --> 02:38:02,966
MARISHA: Julous what?

2355
02:38:03,466 --> 02:38:08,786
LIAM: Julous Dominion. Two centuries.

2356
02:38:08,786 --> 02:38:15,718
MATT: Zadash was the capital of that empire before
the Dwendalian rule conquered them and took over.

2357
02:38:15,718 --> 02:38:22,326
As opposed to erasing their society, they just
allowed it to be integrated into their own

2358
02:38:22,326 --> 02:38:28,170
beliefs, and then just imposed their life upon
those people, their laws, their rules, and

2359
02:38:28,170 --> 02:38:36,866
adjusted as they saw fit. That marked the end of
it. This gravesite seems to have been a reminder

2360
02:38:36,866 --> 02:38:42,904
of soldiers that fought, probably, in those
conflicts or something around that time period,

2361
02:38:42,904 --> 02:38:50,702
and has just been left to the annals of memory as
the Dwendalian influence left no real particular

2362
02:38:50,702 --> 02:38:54,568
interest in those to keep tabs of the history
behind them.

2363
02:38:54,568 --> 02:38:58,942
LIAM: Caleb says: You know, it's funny-- and then
says everything that you just did to everyone in

2364
02:38:58,942 --> 02:39:00,415
the group.

2365
02:39:00,415 --> 02:39:02,773
TALIESIN: That's very interesting.

2366
02:39:02,773 --> 02:39:03,628
LAURA and MARISHA: Wow.

2367
02:39:03,628 --> 02:39:04,937
LIAM: Here's your helmet back.

2368
02:39:04,937 --> 02:39:07,297
TRAVIS: That's very informative, Caleb.

2369
02:39:07,297 --> 02:39:09,257
MARISHA: We can still sell that for scrap metal,
though, right?

2370
02:39:09,257 --> 02:39:12,211
LAURA: I mean, it's pretty rusty.

2371
02:39:12,217 --> 02:39:13,522
MARISHA: Yeah.

2372
02:39:13,522 --> 02:39:15,061
LAURA: Like maybe to a museum or something.

2373
02:39:15,061 --> 02:39:16,613
LIAM: Steeped in history.

2374
02:39:16,613 --> 02:39:19,977
LAURA: The Dwendalian Empire kind of sucks, you
guys.

2375
02:39:19,977 --> 02:39:23,316
MARISHA: I've lived here my whole life. It's kind
of lame.

2376
02:39:23,316 --> 02:39:25,829
LAURA: I mean, the Menagerie Coast is really
cool.

2377
02:39:25,829 --> 02:39:27,544
MARISHA: Never been that far.

2378
02:39:27,544 --> 02:39:28,423
LAURA: Oh, it's amazing!

2379
02:39:28,423 --> 02:39:31,563
MARISHA: Been a lot of places in Dwendalian, but
not that far.

2380
02:39:31,563 --> 02:39:34,007
SAM: There must be some nice places here, right?

2381
02:39:34,007 --> 02:39:36,466
LAURA: I don't know, everything I've seen so
far--

2382
02:39:36,466 --> 02:39:42,041
SAM: Well, that village we were just in was not
bad, except for, you know, the gnoll attack.

2383
02:39:42,041 --> 02:39:46,253
LAURA: That's true. And Bryce was a soldier of the
Dwendalian Empire?

2384
02:39:46,253 --> 02:39:52,385
MARISHA: They're on the outskirts. The further on
the outskirts you go, the more tolerable they are.

2385
02:39:52,385 --> 02:39:54,919
Further north we go...?

2386
02:39:54,919 --> 02:39:57,656
LIAM: The further out you are, the easier it is to
bend the rules.

2387
02:39:57,656 --> 02:40:01,264
LAURA: What's the capital of the Dwendalian
Empire?

2388
02:40:01,264 --> 02:40:02,142
MARISHA: It's--

2389
02:40:02,142 --> 02:40:03,352
SAM: Let's consult our notes.

2390
02:40:03,352 --> 02:40:04,741
LAURA: Is it Rexxentrum?

2391
02:40:04,741 --> 02:40:06,514
MATT and TRAVIS: Rexxentrum.

2392
02:40:06,514 --> 02:40:08,507
SAM: Oh, that's where the magic school is, right?

2393
02:40:08,507 --> 02:40:10,205
LAURA: Yeah.

2394
02:40:10,205 --> 02:40:15,409
MARISHA: I'm just telling you, the more north we
go, the stricter it's going to get. You're going

2395
02:40:15,409 --> 02:40:18,768
to see more and more of the empire and its
influence.

2396
02:40:20,528 --> 02:40:21,857
LAURA: Crazy.

2397
02:40:24,167 --> 02:40:27,625
SAM: Maybe they'll have nicer things. Arts.
Culture.

2398
02:40:27,625 --> 02:40:30,921
MARISHA: Of course they will. It's where all the
money is.

2399
02:40:30,921 --> 02:40:33,740
LIAM: They have the best of the best in the north,
ja.

2400
02:40:33,740 --> 02:40:35,938
LAURA: Do they like arts and culture in the
Dwendalian Empire?

2401
02:40:35,938 --> 02:40:37,549
LIAM: What and culture?

2402
02:40:37,549 --> 02:40:41,519
LIAM and LAURA: Arts and culture.

2403
02:40:41,519 --> 02:40:43,149
LAURA: Do they like painting?

2404
02:40:43,149 --> 02:40:45,099
MARISHA: Farts and vultures.

2405
02:40:45,099 --> 02:40:48,119
LIAM: What are you talking about?

2406
02:40:48,119 --> 02:40:49,548
MARISHA: Never mind.

2407
02:40:49,550 --> 02:40:50,570
LIAM: I hear.

2408
02:40:50,781 --> 02:40:52,928
LAURA: Yeah. Okay. That's good.

2409
02:40:53,488 --> 02:40:54,302
MARISHA: Yeah.

2410
02:40:54,672 --> 02:40:59,136
MATT: You guys continue moving northward again,
the rain still pouring as you all maintain warmth

2411
02:40:59,136 --> 02:41:03,980
best you can, bundling up with the various travel
supplies, blankets and insulation you can muster

2412
02:41:03,980 --> 02:41:05,483
off the cart and your own--

2413
02:41:05,483 --> 02:41:09,215
LAURA: I was taking in the rain, yo! I like it!

2414
02:41:09,215 --> 02:41:10,712
SAM: Hard to tell what motions you're doing.

2415
02:41:10,712 --> 02:41:14,752
LAURA: Shut up! I could see it in my head!

2416
02:41:14,752 --> 02:41:21,556
LIAM: Frumpkin is fucking miserable because he's
drenched and he does not like to be wet.

2417
02:41:21,556 --> 02:41:29,736
MATT: Yep. (sad meow). As you push into the latter
half of the afternoon, a few hours before the sun

2418
02:41:29,736 --> 02:41:37,459
begins to set, you begin cresting a large hill
along the road, before you notice a trio of spiky

2419
02:41:37,459 --> 02:41:43,971
peaks catching your eye, breaking the skyline
ahead of you. As you begin to come higher up to

2420
02:41:43,971 --> 02:41:49,751
the top of that hillside, you can watch these
peaks slowly unveil into the rest of the massive

2421
02:41:49,751 --> 02:41:51,899
skyline of the city of Zadash, breaking the
horizon.

2422
02:41:51,899 --> 02:41:52,699
LAURA: (gasps) Oh my gosh!

2423
02:41:52,699 --> 02:41:56,399
MATT: It's an incredible sight compared to the
rural townships you've encountered here in the

2424
02:41:56,399 --> 02:42:01,636
empire thus far, and comparable in mass to the
coastal metropolis of Port Damali, where you grew

2425
02:42:01,636 --> 02:42:09,649
up. The 15-foot perimeter walls outline the
somewhat triangular shape of the city from your

2426
02:42:09,649 --> 02:42:17,157
current perspective. The communities spilling
beyond the protective bulwarks cascade beyond the

2427
02:42:17,157 --> 02:42:29,365
walls into ramshackle tent cities and hovel towns.
As you ride down the road towards the stretch that

2428
02:42:29,365 --> 02:42:30,599
leads to the southern gates, you pass through
fields of crop workers that are currently out

2429
02:42:30,599 --> 02:42:40,546
there with heavy shawls and head coverings, in the
process of harvesting various vegetables and crops

2430
02:42:40,546 --> 02:42:44,452
from the field. Some take note of your presence
and watch as you pass and then go amongst their

2431
02:42:44,452 --> 02:42:49,156
work; others are too involved, could care less
about the constant passing of travelers northward

2432
02:42:49,156 --> 02:42:57,317
and southward. As you approach closer to the city
still, the external neighborhoods begin to envelop

2433
02:42:57,317 --> 02:43:03,331
your vision as small farmsteads, homes, begin to
mingle with these tents and shacks you had seen at

2434
02:43:03,331 --> 02:43:09,980
a distance. A mother in ragged clothes plucks a
chicken before noticing your band and sending her

2435
02:43:09,980 --> 02:43:15,071
six-year-old boy over, dirt smeared on his face
and no shoes, running up to the mud outside the

2436
02:43:15,071 --> 02:43:19,044
cart and puts his hands out towards you as you
walk past.

2437
02:43:19,044 --> 02:43:19,746
MARISHA: I toss him a silver.

2438
02:43:19,746 --> 02:43:27,584
MATT: He takes it and runs back to his mom and she
just nods. Doesn't make eye contact with you, but

2439
02:43:27,584 --> 02:43:35,458
as soon as the child approaches, gives a nod.
Continues pulling feathers out. Pushing on, the

2440
02:43:35,458 --> 02:43:36,131
foot traffic--

2441
02:43:36,131 --> 02:43:46,619
LIAM: Sorry, Caleb trips, or pretends to, into the
mud, and scoops up two fistfuls of mud and shoves

2442
02:43:46,619 --> 02:43:47,514
them into his pockets.

2443
02:43:47,514 --> 02:43:57,487
MATT: Okay. Easily enough. Pushing on, the foot
traffic grows heavier near the gate. A huge,

2444
02:43:57,487 --> 02:44:04,294
15-foot wide, currently open portcullis is being
held aloft by chains beyond your visual range. As

2445
02:44:04,294 --> 02:44:09,581
two pairs of crownsguards flank each side of this
opening with semi-watchful eyes. They're not

2446
02:44:09,581 --> 02:44:14,615
interrogating passersby; they're keeping a close
watch as folks enter in and out. You can see

2447
02:44:14,615 --> 02:44:19,489
another caravan is currently in the process of
loading up and getting ready to leave southward.

2448
02:44:19,489 --> 02:44:26,068
You can see people are walking in and out from the
external shantytown, and other individuals are--

2449
02:44:26,068 --> 02:44:30,974
some are paying attention to the rather, once
again, your colorful band by comparison; most of the

2450
02:44:30,974 --> 02:44:36,348
folks you see here range between your typical
human populace to the occasional halfling and

2451
02:44:36,348 --> 02:44:44,966
dwarf. The fairer races beyond that haven't caught
your eye yet on this exterior perimeter. Stepping

2452
02:44:44,966 --> 02:44:53,680
beyond, the crownsguard keeping a watch as you
pass, you emerge beyond the threshold of the entry

2453
02:44:54,681 --> 02:44:59,046
gate on the southern wall here, into Zadash. The
smell of wet earth, manure immediately hits your

2454
02:44:59,046 --> 02:45:04,517
nose, accompanied by the sound of hooves, mingling
conversations, distant shouts, and the barking of

2455
02:45:04,517 --> 02:45:11,158
dogs as they welcome you into this new and
interesting city. Glancing up, you can see the

2456
02:45:11,158 --> 02:45:16,555
buildings around you that flank the street
continue to be rather destitute in the atmosphere,

2457
02:45:16,555 --> 02:45:23,389
but then eventually begin to graduate into a
standard village feel. You've arrived.

2458
02:45:23,389 --> 02:45:25,742
LIAM: Is it still raining?

2459
02:45:25,742 --> 02:45:26,461
MATT: It is still raining.

2460
02:45:26,461 --> 02:45:35,180
SAM: This place sucks! Too much water.

2461
02:45:35,180 --> 02:45:39,160
TRAVIS: We should find a place to take some
shelter until this rain lets up.

2462
02:45:39,160 --> 02:45:41,939
SAM: Are we supposed to go to the Pillow Trove or
the Leaky Tap?

2463
02:45:41,939 --> 02:45:46,603
LAURA: Well, we should probably hit the Leaky Tap
first, in the West Outersteads.

2464
02:45:46,603 --> 02:45:48,048
LIAM: Agreed, that is our first stop.

2465
02:45:48,048 --> 02:45:49,367
TALIESIN: East.

2466
02:45:49,367 --> 02:45:50,097
SAM: The East Westersheets. What was it?

2467
02:45:50,097 --> 02:45:50,597
TALIESIN: East Best Western.

2468
02:45:50,597 --> 02:45:57,708
LAURA: It was in the West Outersteads.

2469
02:45:57,708 --> 02:45:58,711
SAM: I thought it was the East Outer!

2470
02:45:58,711 --> 02:46:00,493
LIAM: We are looking for Claudia Sheed.

2471
02:46:00,493 --> 02:46:01,748
MARISHA: East?

2472
02:46:01,748 --> 02:46:02,921
TALIESIN: East.

2473
02:46:02,921 --> 02:46:04,615
LAURA: It was?

2474
02:46:04,615 --> 02:46:06,153
MARISHA: I don't know, I didn't catch it. I got
Claudia Sheed.

2475
02:46:06,153 --> 02:46:13,736
LIAM: I remember exactly, and Matthew will tell me
because of my Keen Mind feat.

2476
02:46:13,736 --> 02:46:16,949
TALIESIN: This is the best thing you've ever
done.

2477
02:46:16,949 --> 02:46:17,836
LIAM: It was entirely on purpose.

2478
02:46:17,836 --> 02:46:24,255
MATT: Bryce, when you were talking about this,
Bryce grew up in the West Outersteads, but Leaky

2479
02:46:24,255 --> 02:46:25,115
Tap is in the east.

2480
02:46:25,115 --> 02:46:25,921
LAURA: Aww!

2481
02:46:25,921 --> 02:46:26,171
MATT: Still take your notes!

2482
02:46:26,171 --> 02:46:28,477
MARISHA: But Bryce grew up in the west.

2483
02:46:28,477 --> 02:46:28,727
LIAM: I took the Clippy feat.

2484
02:46:28,727 --> 02:46:38,011
SAM: Looks like you're writing a letter!

2485
02:46:38,011 --> 02:46:38,496
LIAM: Looks like you can't remember the details
the DM told you. Would you like to ask him again

2486
02:46:38,496 --> 02:46:39,107
and get an exact replication?

2487
02:46:39,107 --> 02:46:45,507
MATT: As the horses are clopping through the mud
and you guys are having this conversation, slowly

2488
02:46:45,507 --> 02:46:48,876
making your way through town, everyone else is
rushing about their business, but you're just

2489
02:46:48,876 --> 02:46:56,241
leisurely just taking in the vicinity. You hear
this coughing off to the side, and you watch as a

2490
02:46:56,241 --> 02:47:02,867
bundled up, hunched-looking human approaches and
goes, "Well, hello! You look a bit lost, and

2491
02:47:02,867 --> 02:47:09,498
obviously not from around here." As the face looks
up, you can see within the hood, a somewhat

2492
02:47:09,498 --> 02:47:17,528
pudgy-looking older man in his mid-60s or so, it
looks to be. He has a thick, bushy, gray mustache

2493
02:47:17,528 --> 02:47:24,519
that turns into a full Stonewall beard on the
side. He has a monocle up in one eye, but it looks

2494
02:47:24,519 --> 02:47:31,139
a bit scratched. The cloak he's wearing is just
covering the rest of his form, but as he looks and

2495
02:47:31,139 --> 02:47:39,871
goes, "I'm just happy to greet you to our fair
city. Do you require anyone to help you around?

2496
02:47:39,871 --> 02:47:41,854
Show you the grounds?"

2497
02:47:41,874 --> 02:47:43,184
MARISHA: How much?

2498
02:47:44,464 --> 02:47:50,722
MATT: "Well, for a day's work, that would merely
run you a paltry two gold pieces."

2499
02:47:50,733 --> 02:47:53,008
TRAVIS: What might your name be, kind stranger?

2500
02:47:53,008 --> 02:48:00,268
MATT: "I am Ulysses Stanneras. I've lived here my
entire life. I'm a purveyor of all the great sites

2501
02:48:00,268 --> 02:48:03,614
and sounds of the city, and it would be my
pleasure."

2502
02:48:04,714 --> 02:48:08,571
LAURA: Ulysses, are you going to flash us or try
to sell us some watches?

2503
02:48:09,691 --> 02:48:11,044
LIAM: What is a watch?

2504
02:48:11,044 --> 02:48:16,041
MATT: They have watches? (laughs) There is
clockwork in this--

2505
02:48:16,041 --> 02:48:16,779
LAURA: There you go!

2506
02:48:16,779 --> 02:48:18,129
LIAM: What is a watch?

2507
02:48:18,129 --> 02:48:21,694
SAM: Oh, he only knows it by the Zemnian name.

2508
02:48:21,694 --> 02:48:22,832
LIAM: You mean, like a guard?

2509
02:48:22,832 --> 02:48:30,074
SAM: No, like a "clockcruzen." That's how you say
it in your language, I think.

2510
02:48:30,074 --> 02:48:31,220
TALIESIN: Mechanical croissant.

2511
02:48:31,220 --> 02:48:33,127
SAM: A "clockenticken."

2512
02:48:33,127 --> 02:48:38,207
LIAM: You are adorably, fucking wrong right now.

2513
02:48:38,207 --> 02:48:41,019
SAM: I've been picking up little bits of the
language.

2514
02:48:41,019 --> 02:48:46,487
LIAM: Okay. To say "yes," it is "ja." That is
your first lesson.

2515
02:48:46,487 --> 02:48:47,232
SAM: Ja.

2516
02:48:47,232 --> 02:48:48,935
LIAM: Everything else you said was shit.

2517
02:48:48,935 --> 02:48:50,302
MARISHA: Stanneras.

2518
02:48:50,302 --> 02:48:52,019
LIAM: Staggeras or Standeras?

2519
02:48:52,019 --> 02:48:53,818
MARISHA, LAURA, MATT, and TALIESIN: Stanneras.

2520
02:48:53,818 --> 02:49:01,721
LIAM: Ulysses Standeras. Strong name, ja, ja,
ja. Ulysses Standeras.

2521
02:49:01,721 --> 02:49:07,811
TRAVIS: It's a fine offer, Ulysses. Where would
you have us get out of this rain for a bit?

2522
02:49:08,751 --> 02:49:15,596
MATT: "Well, there is a small tunnel, maybe about
several hundred feet above; it'll give us some

2523
02:49:15,596 --> 02:49:16,714
break from the rain."

2524
02:49:16,714 --> 02:49:18,383
LAURA: Can we insight check this motherfucker?

2525
02:49:18,383 --> 02:49:19,263
MATT: Of course.

2526
02:49:19,263 --> 02:49:19,972
LAURA: Please.

2527
02:49:19,972 --> 02:49:22,705
MARISHA: Let me take you to the shadiest place,
tourist.

2528
02:49:22,705 --> 02:49:24,059
LAURA: Natural 20!

2529
02:49:24,059 --> 02:49:26,757
(cheering)

2530
02:49:26,757 --> 02:49:29,099
ALL: Whispers!

2531
02:49:29,099 --> 02:49:31,530
LIAM: Mama Bear takes care of the Mighty Nein!

2532
02:49:31,530 --> 02:49:34,564
MARISHA: Yeah! (chants) Den mama! Den mama!

2533
02:49:34,564 --> 02:49:39,843
SAM: It's not D and D Beyond, it's D N D
Beyond. You don't want to type in an "and,"

2534
02:49:39,843 --> 02:49:41,988
because that will take you to a porn site.

2535
02:49:41,988 --> 02:49:43,868
TALIESIN: What doesn't, really?

2536
02:49:46,468 --> 02:49:48,335
SAM: What does Stannis Baratheon say?

2537
02:49:49,705 --> 02:49:50,821
LAURA: I mean.

2538
02:49:52,211 --> 02:49:54,884
SAM: Should we go to this dingy tunnel?

2539
02:49:56,214 --> 02:49:58,055
LAURA: I guess we can?

2540
02:49:59,435 --> 02:50:02,919
LIAM: You say that because it's a good idea, or
because you're feeling--?

2541
02:50:02,919 --> 02:50:08,080
LAURA: I don't know, he just seems like a good guy
some-- I mean, shifty. But I don't think he's

2542
02:50:08,080 --> 02:50:09,692
trying to fuck us right now.

2543
02:50:09,692 --> 02:50:11,019
LIAM: Insight check!

2544
02:50:11,019 --> 02:50:12,631
(laughter)

2545
02:50:12,631 --> 02:50:16,857
MATT: Make an ins-- (laughs and coughs)

2546
02:50:16,857 --> 02:50:18,011
MARISHA: You're insight checking--

2547
02:50:18,011 --> 02:50:18,904
TALIESIN: This is a game of trust.

2548
02:50:19,444 --> 02:50:20,188
LIAM: 18.

2549
02:50:20,728 --> 02:50:22,494
LAURA: Can I whisper to him?

2550
02:50:22,494 --> 02:50:23,714
MATT: Yeah, you may.

2551
02:50:26,464 --> 02:50:28,499
MARISHA: This is our first chain whisper.

2552
02:50:28,499 --> 02:50:30,169
MATT: I love this so much.

2553
02:50:30,169 --> 02:50:32,249
LIAM: What, what?

2554
02:50:33,479 --> 02:50:35,425
SAM: What is going on right now?

2555
02:50:35,425 --> 02:50:36,642
MARISHA: Is D and D Beyond.

2556
02:50:38,212 --> 02:50:39,498
TRAVIS: That's D N D.

2557
02:50:39,498 --> 02:50:40,473
MARISHA: With an N.

2558
02:50:40,473 --> 02:50:41,421
TRAVIS: Beyond.

2559
02:50:41,421 --> 02:50:43,907
MARISHA: Little hitch in it. DND.

2560
02:50:46,247 --> 02:50:51,340
MATT: "Or, not. You're welcome to wander as you
see fit but I was just merely willing to help."

2561
02:50:51,340 --> 02:50:54,779
LAURA: What do you have under that cloak? Is it
weapons?

2562
02:50:55,257 --> 02:51:02,050
MATT: He takes the edges and daintily holds the
cloak open presentery style and he's dressed in

2563
02:51:02,050 --> 02:51:09,196
very fine clothing, like a nice coat that's
buttoned, with a little cravat and fine trousers.

2564
02:51:09,196 --> 02:51:13,822
Or at least they were at one point, the edges are
a little tattered. It looks like his one nice

2565
02:51:13,822 --> 02:51:20,811
suit that he's had for maybe 20 years and it's
definitely seen some rough days. You get the

2566
02:51:20,811 --> 02:51:29,724
sense, from this whole package here, that either
he feigns some level of prominence or has fallen

2567
02:51:29,724 --> 02:51:31,270
very hard from it.

2568
02:51:31,270 --> 02:51:35,550
TRAVIS: Well, Jester, if he's fine by you, I mean,
let's get out of the rain, I'm fucking soaked.

2569
02:51:35,566 --> 02:51:37,043
LAURA: He seems pretty okay, I guess.

2570
02:51:37,043 --> 02:51:37,733
SAM: To the tunnels!

2571
02:51:37,733 --> 02:51:39,377
LIAM: I cast Friends on him.

2572
02:51:39,377 --> 02:51:41,094
MARISHA: So soon.

2573
02:51:41,094 --> 02:51:41,833
SAM: Friends.

2574
02:51:41,833 --> 02:51:43,041
LIAM: Yes. Freunde.

2575
02:51:43,041 --> 02:51:43,741
SAM: Freundes.

2576
02:51:46,471 --> 02:51:50,420
LIAM: And I say. My Freunde--

2577
02:51:52,470 --> 02:51:53,403
MATT: "Yes?"

2578
02:51:53,403 --> 02:51:58,415
LIAM: I have just cast a spell on you, okay? So
you just have to listen to what I'm saying, okay?

2579
02:51:58,415 --> 02:52:06,410
I think you are kind of an asshole but so are we,
we are the Mighty Nein and we will fuck you so

2580
02:52:06,414 --> 02:52:07,614
hard if you fuck with us.

2581
02:52:08,484 --> 02:52:10,063
MATT: Make an intimidation check with advantage.

2582
02:52:12,903 --> 02:52:13,555
LIAM: 20.

2583
02:52:14,245 --> 02:52:22,597
MATT: He goes: "Well, first off that's terribly
rude, affecting me with any sort of arcane-based

2584
02:52:22,597 --> 02:52:26,905
nature enchantments upon first meeting you when
I've been so gracious."

2585
02:52:26,905 --> 02:52:30,933
LIAM: Ja, we're a bunch of Arschlochs, yeah,
we're assholes it's fine, but I'm just saying--

2586
02:52:30,933 --> 02:52:32,347
MATT: "But do you pay?"

2587
02:52:33,427 --> 02:52:34,772
LIAM: Today we do.

2588
02:52:34,772 --> 02:52:37,898
MATT: "Then I think we will do quite well working
together."

2589
02:52:37,898 --> 02:52:48,233
LIAM: Okay, you see this one? The purple one? He
will cut you from navel to nuts, so please, have

2590
02:52:48,233 --> 02:52:50,772
fun with us, but don't you fuck us.

2591
02:52:51,442 --> 02:52:54,363
MATT: "I know better than to cross anyone with
a--"

2592
02:52:54,363 --> 02:52:59,033
LAURA: Unless we ask for it. And then you're
welcome to do it.

2593
02:53:00,693 --> 02:53:05,691
MATT: "Well then, shall we get out of this rain?
Follow me." He closes his cloak and begins to dart

2594
02:53:05,691 --> 02:53:10,550
with a really rapid gait further down the road and
then turn off to the right. You can now see the

2595
02:53:10,551 --> 02:53:16,734
city. Beyond the outer wall, it looks like there
are a number of perimeter walls that have arches

2596
02:53:16,734 --> 02:53:21,481
between them almost like under a bridge and
there are constructs-- houses that are built

2597
02:53:21,481 --> 02:53:27,989
through those gaps and in these small tunnels that
are maybe 15 to 20 feet in length but, you know,

2598
02:53:27,989 --> 02:53:37,161
40 foot wide where these large separation barriers
are and you can see along the top there are carts

2599
02:53:37,161 --> 02:53:45,675
that move on their own along these wall tops and
it catches your eyes. One of them shifts down, it's curious.

2600
02:53:45,675 --> 02:53:47,209
MARISHA: Like a people mover?

2601
02:53:47,209 --> 02:53:48,495
MATT: Kind of.

2602
02:53:48,495 --> 02:53:49,829
LIAM: Like a people mover.

2603
02:53:49,829 --> 02:53:51,042
MARISHA: Like Disney!

2604
02:53:51,042 --> 02:53:52,992
SAM: They have a monorail?

2605
02:53:52,992 --> 02:53:55,609
LAURA and MARISHA: They have a monorail in
Zadash!

2606
02:53:55,609 --> 02:53:58,120
MATT: He guides you underneath one of these
arches.

2607
02:53:58,120 --> 02:54:01,385
LAURA: Does it look shady in there? I mean, are
there people in there?

2608
02:54:01,385 --> 02:54:04,427
MATT: Yeah, there are people wandering through.
It's just where one of the streets turns off to

2609
02:54:04,427 --> 02:54:08,806
it. It sounded a lot shadier when he presented it
than it was, but it's more just like a brief

2610
02:54:08,806 --> 02:54:13,234
respite from where people are walking through and
occasionally you see a couple crownsguard that

2611
02:54:13,234 --> 02:54:14,144
come through passing.

2612
02:54:14,144 --> 02:54:15,423
LIAM: This guy is good.

2613
02:54:15,423 --> 02:54:21,482
TALIESIN: Forgive our friend, someone attempted to
mug us on the way into the city, he's still a bit sore.

2614
02:54:21,482 --> 02:54:22,489
MATT: "Oh, that's all right"

2615
02:54:22,489 --> 02:54:24,218
TRAVIS: He recovered from four arrows to the
chest.

2616
02:54:24,708 --> 02:54:26,721
LAURA: Three actually because you got one.

2617
02:54:26,721 --> 02:54:27,457
MARISHA: I did.

2618
02:54:27,457 --> 02:54:28,069
LIAM: Ja.

2619
02:54:28,069 --> 02:54:28,593
TRAVIS: My apologies.

2620
02:54:29,463 --> 02:54:37,510
MATT: "That's impressive, Mighty Nein." He pulls
his hood back and he has this Benjamin Franklin

2621
02:54:37,510 --> 02:54:43,608
skullet going on where there it's curly, wavy,
gray hair, but it's balding on top and he throws

2622
02:54:43,608 --> 02:54:50,494
the cloak over one shoulder. "So now that you've
arrived. What's your business here? What can I

2623
02:54:50,494 --> 02:54:53,264
help you with? What do you want to see? What can I
show you?"

2624
02:54:54,684 --> 02:54:56,567
LAURA: Well we need to--

2625
02:54:57,207 --> 02:54:58,653
SAM: Sell some things?

2626
02:54:58,653 --> 02:55:04,793
LAURA: We need to get to a blacksmith. Oh, we need
to go somewhere that'll buy expensive-y magic-y

2627
02:55:04,793 --> 02:55:08,107
things and somewhere that'll buy junky, shitty
things.

2628
02:55:08,107 --> 02:55:09,727
TALIESIN and LAURA: Antiques.

2629
02:55:09,727 --> 02:55:12,793
MATT: "Both of those you can probably find in the
Pentamarket."

2630
02:55:13,703 --> 02:55:14,986
LIAM: Penta-what now?

2631
02:55:14,986 --> 02:55:16,153
MATT: "Pentamarket."

2632
02:55:16,153 --> 02:55:22,506
LIAM: Pentamarket. Would the Pentamarket also have
the finest inks und parchment?

2633
02:55:22,506 --> 02:55:28,834
MATT: "It would have probably some of the finer
inks, yes. The finest you could probably find

2634
02:55:28,834 --> 02:55:31,436
there or in the Tri-Spires."

2635
02:55:31,436 --> 02:55:32,870
LIAM: Tri-Spies?

2636
02:55:32,870 --> 02:55:34,237
MATT: "Tri-Spires."

2637
02:55:35,717 --> 02:55:40,113
LIAM: What about of arcane quality?

2638
02:55:40,113 --> 02:55:45,139
MATT: "There are a few places you could go, yes.
Actually, if we're going towards the Pentamarket,

2639
02:55:45,139 --> 02:55:51,777
your best luck there would be the Invulnerable
Vagrant. Yes."

2640
02:55:51,777 --> 02:55:53,376
TRAVIS: The Invulnerable Vagrant?

2641
02:55:53,376 --> 02:55:54,125
MATT: "Yes."

2642
02:55:54,125 --> 02:55:56,111
TRAVIS: Excellent names in this place.

2643
02:55:57,671 --> 02:56:12,823
LIAM: Also, I am a collector of rare tomes. I have
a great appreciation for literature. Where might I

2644
02:56:12,823 --> 02:56:15,051
find the most--

2645
02:56:17,681 --> 02:56:19,434
TRAVIS: Nudie picture books!

2646
02:56:22,664 --> 02:56:25,663
LIAM: --elaborate writings in the city?

2647
02:56:25,663 --> 02:56:28,186
MATT: "That would probably be at the Archive.

2648
02:56:28,186 --> 02:56:29,557
LIAM: The Archive?

2649
02:56:30,010 --> 02:56:30,721
MATT: "Yes."

2650
02:56:30,721 --> 02:56:34,110
LIAM: Could you give me a little more background?
That is a very common word.

2651
02:56:34,110 --> 02:56:40,997
MATT: "The Archive of the Cobalt Soul here in the
city. It's a library that is maintained by a

2652
02:56:40,997 --> 02:56:52,258
number of... believers. But as long as you're not
taking anything from within, and you have approved

2653
02:56:52,258 --> 02:56:57,612
entry and are heavily watched within, for the most
part you can peruse the content of the interior."

2654
02:56:57,612 --> 02:57:04,045
LIAM: That is excellent. Also, I'm a big reader.
Is there any place that has pulp fiction and

2655
02:57:04,045 --> 02:57:04,806
shitty smut?

2656
02:57:06,726 --> 02:57:14,988
MATT: "I mean, I'm sure there are, but I would not
bother myself with such base interests of reading."

2657
02:57:14,988 --> 02:57:16,168
LIAM: Insight check.

2658
02:57:16,168 --> 02:57:17,882
MATT: Make an insight check.

2659
02:57:19,452 --> 02:57:21,454
LIAM: That is 23.

2660
02:57:25,704 --> 02:57:28,162
LAURA: So many whispers!

2661
02:57:40,362 --> 02:57:46,768
LIAM: My friend-- I take him by the
hands and say, You have given us a great welcome

2662
02:57:46,768 --> 02:57:48,239
into this city.

2663
02:57:48,239 --> 02:57:49,666
MATT: "My pleasure."

2664
02:57:49,666 --> 02:57:58,542
LIAM: So eager to learn all about it. I take my
hands away, and he has two gold in his hand. Just

2665
02:57:58,542 --> 02:58:00,864
know, I'm a big reader.

2666
02:58:02,474 --> 02:58:12,999
MATT: "Then, perhaps, if you find your way somehow
into the Tri-Spires' southern quarter, somewhere

2667
02:58:12,999 --> 02:58:17,505
in the vicinity of--" Let me look it up real fast.
Look at my own notes.

2668
02:58:17,505 --> 02:58:18,616
LIAM: It worked!

2669
02:58:23,466 --> 02:58:32,250
MATT: "On the southern side of the Silken Terrace,
you'll find a place known as Chastity's Nook. That

2670
02:58:32,250 --> 02:58:35,369
may be where you'll find what you're looking for,
friend."

2671
02:58:38,759 --> 02:58:43,432
LAURA: That was one of the names of the other
courtesans at the place my mom--

2672
02:58:43,432 --> 02:58:48,715
MARISHA: That's a good name for her, Chastity
Nook. Yeah, that's good.

2673
02:58:49,735 --> 02:58:53,361
TALIESIN: We'll probably be staying at the Leaky
Tap.

2674
02:58:53,361 --> 02:58:58,214
MATT: "The Leaky Tap, you say? Well, it's
affordable."

2675
02:58:58,214 --> 02:59:00,532
TALIESIN: We're trying to keep a low profile.

2676
02:59:00,532 --> 02:59:12,782
MATT: "Fair enough, fair enough. The Leaky Tap,
that'll be in the East Outersteads, actually. Bit

2677
02:59:12,782 --> 02:59:14,561
of a rowdy clientele."

2678
02:59:14,561 --> 02:59:15,817
TALIESIN: Perfect for me.

2679
02:59:18,487 --> 02:59:21,330
MATT: "It's bawdy and fun."

2680
02:59:21,330 --> 02:59:28,295
TALIESIN: Definitely perfect for me. Would you say
there's a reasonable bathhouse for someone who's--

2681
02:59:28,295 --> 02:59:29,830
LAURA: Stinky?

2682
02:59:29,830 --> 02:59:32,585
TALIESIN: --and complicated, in the horns?

2683
02:59:36,245 --> 02:59:37,801
MATT: "For your clientele--"

2684
02:59:37,801 --> 02:59:40,941
TALIESIN: Somewhere I can take a nice bath in
peace.

2685
02:59:40,941 --> 02:59:45,177
MATT: "That could be--" You guys are really--

2686
02:59:45,177 --> 02:59:48,970
TRAVIS: Yeah. Run us through it, Encyclopedia
Britannica. Give it to us.

2687
02:59:48,970 --> 02:59:51,198
TALIESIN: Don't want to scare the locals too
much.

2688
02:59:52,688 --> 02:59:53,525
MARISHA: Not yet.

2689
02:59:53,525 --> 02:59:54,419
TRAVIS: Don't you?

2690
02:59:57,699 --> 02:59:59,122
MATT: "The Steam's Respite."

2691
02:59:59,122 --> 03:00:00,718
TALIESIN: That'll do it.

2692
03:00:00,718 --> 03:00:02,348
LIAM: Caleb heard that.

2693
03:00:02,348 --> 03:00:08,455
TALIESIN: I throw another gold at him. You are a
fount of information.

2694
03:00:08,455 --> 03:00:10,411
MATT: "That's what I'm here for."

2695
03:00:10,411 --> 03:00:12,775
LAURA: The Pillow Trove. Is that in the
Tri-Spires?

2696
03:00:12,775 --> 03:00:19,721
MATT: "That is." He glances quickly over towards
Caleb. "You aren't planning to stay there, are you?"

2697
03:00:19,721 --> 03:00:20,546
LAURA: Why?

2698
03:00:23,456 --> 03:00:25,255
LIAM: We've heard good things.

2699
03:00:26,435 --> 03:00:30,961
MATT: "They work for a certain clientele."

2700
03:00:31,491 --> 03:00:33,308
TALIESIN: You can be frank.

2701
03:00:33,308 --> 03:00:36,184
LAURA: What kind of clientele?

2702
03:00:36,184 --> 03:00:45,316
MATT: "Those who live in the Tri-Spire or can
afford to stay at the-- Well, you're welcome to try."

2703
03:00:45,323 --> 03:00:48,588
LAURA: Are they super snooty there?

2704
03:00:48,588 --> 03:00:49,824
MATT: "You could say that, yes."

2705
03:00:49,824 --> 03:00:51,844
LAURA: Do they not like you very much?

2706
03:00:51,844 --> 03:00:55,111
MATT: "Not anymore."

2707
03:00:55,111 --> 03:00:58,305
MARISHA: You used to be a regular?

2708
03:00:58,305 --> 03:01:01,100
MATT: "I was a man about town, yes."

2709
03:01:02,440 --> 03:01:03,446
MARISHA: Was?

2710
03:01:03,446 --> 03:01:13,935
MATT: "Well, things change. Life changes. Partners
disappear with your business's goods and funds and

2711
03:01:13,935 --> 03:01:18,567
leave you having to make a living showing people
around the city."

2712
03:01:18,567 --> 03:01:20,487
MARISHA: That's telling, yeah.

2713
03:01:20,487 --> 03:01:21,577
LAURA: That's awful.

2714
03:01:21,577 --> 03:01:23,595
SAM: That does sound terrible.

2715
03:01:23,595 --> 03:01:26,241
MATT: "It's very sad, I know. But anyway."

2716
03:01:26,241 --> 03:01:29,479
MARISHA: What shop did you used to own?

2717
03:01:29,479 --> 03:01:35,562
MATT: "We used to run a business that sold and
traded leathers, but I was ousted and I've been

2718
03:01:35,562 --> 03:01:37,592
scraping by ever since."

2719
03:01:37,592 --> 03:01:40,256
MARISHA: Are you a craftsman in the trade?

2720
03:01:40,256 --> 03:01:49,305
MATT: "I was more of a business connection, if you
will. My partner was the crafter. I knew a few

2721
03:01:49,305 --> 03:01:51,130
things I'd picked up throughout the years, but--"

2722
03:01:54,490 --> 03:01:59,046
MARISHA: I mean, a businessman can sell anything,
right? Why don't you get back into it? You still

2723
03:01:59,046 --> 03:02:01,369
have all those connections.

2724
03:02:02,479 --> 03:02:09,583
MATT: "Put it this way. Strangely enough, I make
half as much with a quarter of the emphasis doing

2725
03:02:09,583 --> 03:02:11,310
what I'm doing for you now."

2726
03:02:12,410 --> 03:02:13,267
MARISHA: Fair.

2727
03:02:13,267 --> 03:02:15,554
LAURA: Lot of people come through town?

2728
03:02:15,554 --> 03:02:17,682
MATT: "A lot of people come through town."

2729
03:02:17,682 --> 03:02:21,111
LIAM: Is it easy to work around the Empire here?

2730
03:02:21,111 --> 03:02:27,453
MATT: "It can be. You can look for work. You can
head to the--" He points out here. This would be,

2731
03:02:27,453 --> 03:02:31,644
"The Signet Wall, if you're more of a sellsword."

2732
03:02:31,644 --> 03:02:33,359
MARISHA: The Signet Wall?

2733
03:02:33,359 --> 03:02:39,117
MATT: "The Signet Wall. That's where the military
stays, and most of the Crownsguard are holed up."

2734
03:02:39,117 --> 03:02:40,517
LAURA: Let's not go there.

2735
03:02:42,707 --> 03:02:44,576
MARISHA: Do you know a good blacksmith?

2736
03:02:45,226 --> 03:02:50,549
MATT: "The Pentamarket would be a place where you
could find. There is the Spark Hammer Smithing,

2737
03:02:50,549 --> 03:02:56,518
that would be of aid to you. There's also
Packwearer's Provisions, but they're more of a

2738
03:02:56,518 --> 03:03:01,646
smaller scale, smithing goods, tools, and such."

2739
03:03:02,756 --> 03:03:04,569
TALIESIN: More of an antique collector.

2740
03:03:05,729 --> 03:03:07,630
MARISHA: Maybe he'll want that helmet.

2741
03:03:15,460 --> 03:03:18,990
LAURA: Okay. I think we learned a lot.

2742
03:03:18,990 --> 03:03:25,100
MATT: "And, looking up at the sky, it appears the
sun has set, which means my purchased day is done.

2743
03:03:25,100 --> 03:03:27,351
It's been an absolute pleasure."

2744
03:03:27,351 --> 03:03:29,876
LAURA: Oh, but Ulysses, we like you so much!

2745
03:03:29,876 --> 03:03:35,010
TALIESIN: We're looking forward to seeing you
again. To the inn!

2746
03:03:35,010 --> 03:03:36,532
LAURA: Where do you stay?

2747
03:03:36,532 --> 03:03:40,082
MATT: "Well, it appears that our business
transaction has come to an end. If you would like

2748
03:03:40,082 --> 03:03:42,370
to rent another day, I'd be happy to answer your
questions."

2749
03:03:43,720 --> 03:03:45,063
TRAVIS: Shittiest pay phone ever.

2750
03:03:47,493 --> 03:03:51,203
SAM: Well, come see us at the Leaky Tap and maybe
we'll hire you tomorrow morning.

2751
03:03:51,203 --> 03:03:53,262
LAURA: That's true!

2752
03:03:53,262 --> 03:04:00,597
MATT: He leans forward to you with a closer look.
He goes, "Maybe."

2753
03:04:00,597 --> 03:04:03,473
SAM: I have extreme syphilis.

2754
03:04:03,940 --> 03:04:07,240
MATT: Make a deception check.

2755
03:04:07,240 --> 03:04:09,659
SAM: One.

2756
03:04:09,659 --> 03:04:19,934
MATT: The fact that that was your lie scares him
more than believing it could've ever done. He

2757
03:04:19,934 --> 03:04:28,857
goes, "Very well. Enjoy your stay at the Leaky
Tap. I'll be on my way." He throws his hood up and

2758
03:04:28,857 --> 03:04:30,339
darts back out into the rain.

2759
03:04:30,339 --> 03:04:35,323
LAURA: Oh man, I liked him. I'm almost sad that we
didn't believe him at first.

2760
03:04:35,323 --> 03:04:37,457
SAM: Was he trustworthy?

2761
03:04:37,457 --> 03:04:38,031
TALIESIN: No.

2762
03:04:38,031 --> 03:04:42,717
LIAM: I mean, no, he's not trustworthy, but we are
birds of a feather.

2763
03:04:42,717 --> 03:04:46,500
TALIESIN: Don't trust trusting people, they're
just the worst.

2764
03:04:46,500 --> 03:04:50,086
LAURA: He was trustworthy enough that he wasn't
going to, you know.

2765
03:04:50,086 --> 03:04:52,288
TALIESIN: No, I have full faith in untrustworthy
people.

2766
03:04:52,288 --> 03:04:55,655
LIAM: Yes, he was predictably a shit, just as we
are.

2767
03:04:55,655 --> 03:04:59,715
LAURA: I forgot to ask him about bakeries, so I am
going to keep an eye out for them.

2768
03:04:59,715 --> 03:05:02,127
SAM: I will aid her in that search.

2769
03:05:02,127 --> 03:05:09,611
MATT: Okay. You guys are making your way towards
the East Outersteads?

2770
03:05:09,611 --> 03:05:13,908
LAURA: Would we be passing through the Pentamarket
on the way to the Leaky Tavern?

2771
03:05:13,908 --> 03:05:18,079
MATT: You'd have to curve around to do that. Do
you want to?

2772
03:05:18,079 --> 03:05:20,015
MARISHA: Do things shut down in an hour here?

2773
03:05:20,015 --> 03:05:23,017
MATT: You don't know. Well, you've been here.

2774
03:05:23,017 --> 03:05:24,015
MARISHA: I've been here.

2775
03:05:24,015 --> 03:05:29,559
MATT: You haven't spent a lot of time in Zadash.
In fact, probably the last thing you did before

2776
03:05:29,559 --> 03:05:39,457
your family said, "Come home," was here. You know
it a little bit. You've been to the Pentamarket,

2777
03:05:39,457 --> 03:05:42,067
you would be able to guide the rest of them
through the Pentamarket if you wanted to.

2778
03:05:42,067 --> 03:05:44,537
MARISHA: Do I know that it stays? Do they keep
later hours?

2779
03:05:44,537 --> 03:05:50,508
MATT: Yeah. Some of them do, some of them don't.
Some merchants prefer to use the night for revelry

2780
03:05:50,508 --> 03:05:55,523
and spending some of what they made for the day.
Some know that those who drink and revel sometimes

2781
03:05:55,523 --> 03:05:58,397
make poor choices in their purchases, so it can
vary.

2782
03:05:58,397 --> 03:06:04,182
LAURA: We can sleep first and then get settled
into the Leaky Tap, and then sell our shit tomorrow.

2783
03:06:04,182 --> 03:06:08,187
MARISHA: I'd like to say maybe selling our shit
now. That way it doesn't get robbed in the night.

2784
03:06:08,187 --> 03:06:10,413
LAURA: Either way.

2785
03:06:10,413 --> 03:06:15,499
TRAVIS: I'm inclined to agree, actually. The
longer we keep it out here, the more eyes will be

2786
03:06:15,499 --> 03:06:16,090
on it.

2787
03:06:16,090 --> 03:06:16,894
LAURA: All right.

2788
03:06:16,894 --> 03:06:24,158
MARISHA: I think the Pentamarket's that way. I've
got a hunch. We can just slide by and see. Small detour.

2789
03:06:24,158 --> 03:06:25,055
TRAVIS: Might be no one home.

2790
03:06:27,215 --> 03:06:37,599
MATT: As you guys wander through the cold rain,
making your way, aside from you, perhaps, this is

2791
03:06:37,599 --> 03:06:43,218
the largest city any of you have visited.
Comparable to Port Damali, but much taller. Damali

2792
03:06:43,218 --> 03:06:48,827
was a little more spread out. This has
architecture and buildings that are designed to

2793
03:06:48,827 --> 03:06:54,251
rise, and almost seem to curve when you're looking
up at it. In certain moments, if you're not

2794
03:06:54,251 --> 03:06:58,273
careful, it can give a hint of vertigo, just at
the height of some of these structures.

2795
03:06:58,273 --> 03:06:59,708
MARISHA: Like New York compared to L.A.?

2796
03:06:59,708 --> 03:07:07,002
MATT: Yeah, that's a good way to put it.
Rexxentrum is still easily twice the size of this

2797
03:07:07,002 --> 03:07:13,793
city. As you make your way outside of the
Pentamarket, and it's called this because central

2798
03:07:13,793 --> 03:07:20,650
to Zadash, a number of the streets that bisect it
naturally carved a pentagonal shape and the

2799
03:07:20,650 --> 03:07:26,694
interior between all these streets has since
become the center of most merchant business, and

2800
03:07:26,694 --> 03:07:35,132
there's a bazaar set up in the center of that
penta-shape, where carts and tents and buildings

2801
03:07:35,132 --> 03:07:41,857
are out there all day, every day. It's an open
market. As you're making your way through the

2802
03:07:41,857 --> 03:07:44,697
rain, some of them are closing early. Some of them
are closing up because of the weather, and it's

2803
03:07:44,697 --> 03:07:49,907
not going as well as most days would when it isn't
so freezing. You can see your breath escaping from

2804
03:07:49,907 --> 03:07:57,228
you with each exhale. You ask around a bit. Make
an investigation check, as you're guiding the troupe.

2805
03:07:57,871 --> 03:08:06,134
MARISHA: Okay. 13 plus four is 17.

2806
03:08:06,134 --> 03:08:11,352
MATT: Easy enough. You ask around. You see a few
folks that seem to be locals, or at least who

2807
03:08:11,352 --> 03:08:16,198
often find their way through this district. They
lead you over towards a large building of stained

2808
03:08:16,198 --> 03:08:23,434
wood and green-gold velvet hanging on the outside.
The first thought is, that velvet's going to get

2809
03:08:23,434 --> 03:08:31,213
ruined in this rain! As you approach the exterior
of it, the building is untouched. It is dry. You

2810
03:08:31,213 --> 03:08:36,388
do glance up, and you can see, carved delicately
into a wood placard above the doors, which are

2811
03:08:36,388 --> 03:08:42,697
currently closed, but little slips of glass in
each door reveal a warm, lit interior that's

2812
03:08:42,697 --> 03:08:46,407
glowing from the inside out. It says, The
Invulnerable Vagrant.

2813
03:08:49,707 --> 03:08:53,860
MARISHA: Caleb. I think this is going to be where
you're going to stock up on your incense and some

2814
03:08:53,860 --> 03:08:54,822
other goodies.

2815
03:08:54,822 --> 03:08:59,391
LIAM: Yes, yes. I won't be long. Excuse me. And I
just push in.

2816
03:09:00,521 --> 03:09:05,317
TALIESIN: I'm going to find mulled wine. It's
cold, and I want to be warm.

2817
03:09:05,317 --> 03:09:06,917
MARISHA: I'll join in that.

2818
03:09:06,917 --> 03:09:11,667
LAURA: I want to try to sell the glaive here, if
it's magic. If they sell magical weapons at this place.

2819
03:09:11,668 --> 03:09:13,926
MATT: Okay. Who's entering?

2820
03:09:13,926 --> 03:09:15,475
TRAVIS: I'll go in, too.

2821
03:09:15,475 --> 03:09:16,392
MARISHA: I'll wait back.

2822
03:09:16,392 --> 03:09:17,556
SAM: I'll go in as well.

2823
03:09:17,556 --> 03:09:19,074
MATT: You guys staying out?

2824
03:09:19,074 --> 03:09:22,024
TALIESIN: We'll watch the cart and we're going to
take the cart to find some mulled wine.

2825
03:09:26,454 --> 03:09:33,095
MATT: Okay. As you enter the interior of the
building, it's warm. It's very warm, and it's a

2826
03:09:33,095 --> 03:09:37,887
nice change of pace. You immediately throw your
cloak back as the temperature shift causes you --

2827
03:09:37,887 --> 03:09:44,349
everyone but you, actually, you're pretty
comfortable in the cold-- to immediately throw

2828
03:09:44,349 --> 03:09:50,802
your heavy layers back. On the immediate entry,
you can see there's lanterns all throughout the

2829
03:09:50,802 --> 03:09:56,562
chamber that are hanging up above, flickering
candlelight, but they all flicker like there's

2830
03:09:56,562 --> 03:10:03,001
wind when there's none. You also notice that all
of them are floating. They're little glass

2831
03:10:03,001 --> 03:10:12,800
chambers that contain the candle and they're all
slowly gyrating, held in place. Inside the chamber

2832
03:10:12,800 --> 03:10:22,864
you can see a long table that has a few small
books laid out. On a velvet raised platform

2833
03:10:22,864 --> 03:10:28,354
there's a long blade, like a rapier of some kind.
It looks jeweled and gorgeous. In the back there

2834
03:10:28,354 --> 03:10:35,253
appears to be a shelf with books and books and
books with a desk. You see three figures, two of

2835
03:10:35,253 --> 03:10:43,964
which are facing away behind the desk. The one
that is closest to you turns around to make your

2836
03:10:43,964 --> 03:10:55,096
appearance. You see a large, seven-foot tall
humanoid figure. Short, bushy, curly brown hair

2837
03:10:55,096 --> 03:11:06,253
fros up a little bit. The body is very fine
grayish brown fur. And their nose is wide almost

2838
03:11:06,253 --> 03:11:18,052
like a cow or a bull's nose across a human face.
The chin's a bit square and the physicality is

2839
03:11:18,052 --> 03:11:21,414
hunched and there's just a big smile on the face.

2840
03:11:25,484 --> 03:11:32,800
LIAM: I'm sorry. Yes. I've not been in this big
a city in a while.

2841
03:11:32,800 --> 03:11:34,563
MATT: Make a nature check.

2842
03:11:34,683 --> 03:11:37,525
LIAM: Yeah. 20.

2843
03:11:40,165 --> 03:11:46,265
MATT: You have not encountered this folk before in
your travels. It's rare to see them ingrained in

2844
03:11:46,265 --> 03:11:49,656
society this close. Firbolgs--

2845
03:11:49,656 --> 03:11:51,214
MARISHA and LAURA: Firbolgs?

2846
03:11:51,214 --> 03:11:52,554
LIAM: Yeah, firbolgs.

2847
03:11:52,554 --> 03:11:59,463
MATT: Yeah, they are usually a more nature-based,
free-spirited people that live more towards the

2848
03:11:59,463 --> 03:12:04,857
mountains of the northern forests in the Greying
Wildlands and beyond. To see one here in society

2849
03:12:04,857 --> 03:12:09,698
catches you off-guard, let alone one that's
dressed so well. You can see these long elegant

2850
03:12:09,698 --> 03:12:18,523
robes of deep green and gold and this big smile on
his face as he spins around. "Yes. I'm happy to

2851
03:12:18,523 --> 03:12:20,614
help you."

2852
03:12:22,464 --> 03:12:29,648
LIAM: DM. Sorry. Before I engage in this. You say
I've never encountered these, but I've read a lot.

2853
03:12:29,668 --> 03:12:32,090
MATT: Yeah. You know of them.

2854
03:12:32,090 --> 03:12:34,631
LIAM: I know of them. This is my first encounter.

2855
03:12:34,631 --> 03:12:35,592
MATT: Yeah.

2856
03:12:35,592 --> 03:12:36,418
TRAVIS: Dive in.

2857
03:12:36,418 --> 03:12:44,731
LIAM: Hello. Wow. Look at those horns. I'm so
sorry. You know, I have never-- Forget it. I am

2858
03:12:44,731 --> 03:12:45,894
looking for--

2859
03:12:45,894 --> 03:12:54,524
I have been in the woods for so long, I'm so happy
to be in a metropolis again. I need ink.

2860
03:12:54,524 --> 03:13:05,085
MATT: "Before we can get to that, I just have to
say you're, respectfully, terribly filthy. And

2861
03:13:05,085 --> 03:13:11,813
this is an establishment that I have to insist
requires some more cleanliness." As he waves his

2862
03:13:11,813 --> 03:13:19,631
hand in front of you, you watch as all the dirt on
your coat just begins to sift away. Your clothing

2863
03:13:19,631 --> 03:13:26,682
becomes clean right up the front of you reaching
up towards your neck. The dirt begins to fleck

2864
03:13:26,682 --> 03:13:28,185
away across your face.

2865
03:13:28,185 --> 03:13:30,359
LIAM: I'm tilting. I'm arching my face.

2866
03:13:30,359 --> 03:13:36,575
MATT: As you fight it, a moment passes and you see
before you for the first time since you've met, a

2867
03:13:36,575 --> 03:13:40,496
sparkly clean Caleb.

2868
03:13:40,496 --> 03:13:45,525
SAM: Caleb?! What have you done to him?! What have
you done to Caleb?!

2869
03:13:45,525 --> 03:13:51,018
MATT: "Oh, you're just an excitable little friend
there, aren't you?" This giant hand goes down and

2870
03:13:51,018 --> 03:13:52,938
pats you on the head.

2871
03:13:52,938 --> 03:13:55,097
SAM: Ah! It's gentle.

2872
03:13:55,097 --> 03:13:56,103
LIAM: I don't see. I have no idea.

2873
03:13:56,103 --> 03:13:59,565
LAURA: Caleb, you're beautiful!

2874
03:13:59,565 --> 03:14:05,543
MATT: At this point, the two other figures in the
back turn around and it's the same guy.

2875
03:14:05,543 --> 03:14:06,556
LIAM and SAM: What?!

2876
03:14:06,556 --> 03:14:13,203
MATT: There's two more of the same firbolg. The
same outfit. Same exact visual. They both go,

2877
03:14:13,203 --> 03:14:15,139
"Hi!" "Hi."

2878
03:14:19,459 --> 03:14:23,295
LIAM: Okay, this is a little off-putting.

2879
03:14:23,295 --> 03:14:25,550
LAURA: I Invoke Duplicity.

2880
03:14:27,300 --> 03:14:32,546
MATT: "Ho, ho, ho! Well, that's just impressive."

2881
03:14:32,546 --> 03:14:33,982
LAURA: You're impressive!

2882
03:14:33,982 --> 03:14:38,213
MATT: He reaches out and puts his hand out to
shake your hand. "What's your name?"

2883
03:14:38,213 --> 03:14:39,067
LAURA: Jester.

2884
03:14:39,067 --> 03:14:41,134
MATT: "And what's your name?"

2885
03:14:41,134 --> 03:14:42,625
LAURA: Oh, that's Jester #2.

2886
03:14:42,625 --> 03:14:43,515
MATT: It goes through her hand.

2887
03:14:43,515 --> 03:14:46,513
LAURA: I know. I'm sorry about that.

2888
03:14:46,513 --> 03:14:57,256
MATT: "Oh, that's an illusion. Okay. I'm Enchanter
Pumat Sol. And this--" "I am also Enchanter Pumat

2889
03:14:57,256 --> 03:15:03,942
Sol." And the third one goes, "I myself am also
Enchanter Pumat Sol."

2890
03:15:03,942 --> 03:15:07,339
LIAM: First question that I have for you, Pumats.

2891
03:15:07,339 --> 03:15:08,854
MATT: "The fourth one's in the back."

2892
03:15:08,854 --> 03:15:15,983
LIAM: Pumat Sol, is there one of you and this is
fun and games or you are--?

2893
03:15:15,983 --> 03:15:26,898
MATT: "There's the prime Pumat Sol and the three
of us are what you would call magically manifested

2894
03:15:26,898 --> 03:15:28,200
duplicates to aid in his work."

2895
03:15:28,200 --> 03:15:33,507
LIAM: Understood. Well, I only came here for
business, so--

2896
03:15:33,507 --> 03:15:40,049
MATT: "Well! Welcome to the establishment: The
Invulnerable Vagrant greets all of you humbly."

2897
03:15:40,049 --> 03:15:48,204
LIAM: I am finding it very hard to concentrate at
the moment, but I know that I need paper and the

2898
03:15:48,204 --> 03:15:49,438
most expensive ink you have.

2899
03:15:49,438 --> 03:15:56,042
MATT: "Oh, we have both of those things, come with
me." He turns around and you can see now as he

2900
03:15:56,042 --> 03:16:01,337
turns around his head is about to smack into one
of these candles and he just-- knowing where it

2901
03:16:01,337 --> 03:16:06,951
is. He's been so practiced, he just ducks under it
and continues walking toward the back. "He needs

2902
03:16:06,951 --> 03:16:14,950
some--" "Oh I heard him." He turns around and
takes down a couple of inkwells and sets them in

2903
03:16:14,950 --> 03:16:21,818
front. The other one is pulling out stacks of
paper and parchment and is stacking them up, and

2904
03:16:21,818 --> 03:16:27,610
they set them there. "All right, so how much do
you need of how much of each?"

2905
03:16:27,610 --> 03:16:28,625
LIAM: You know--

2906
03:16:28,625 --> 03:16:32,156
MARISHA: This guy's our new Gilmore, you guys!

2907
03:16:32,156 --> 03:16:35,800
LIAM: I am not seducing this person.

2908
03:16:35,800 --> 03:16:38,944
MATT: You say this now!

2909
03:16:38,944 --> 03:16:39,796
LIAM: Touché!

2910
03:16:39,796 --> 03:16:44,641
MARISHA: Five hundred hours later we're fighting
gods with him!

2911
03:16:44,641 --> 03:16:54,218
LIAM: I need your most fine arcane ink and I also
need your finest paper. I need about 150 gold

2912
03:16:54,218 --> 03:16:59,171
worth of materials. Is that too much to ask?

2913
03:16:59,171 --> 03:17:07,878
MATT: "No, that's comparably, respectfully, a
paltry sum. We can get that paper to you. When you

2914
03:17:07,878 --> 03:17:16,376
say ink, I have to specify: do you want ink that's
used in the ritualistic design and presentation of

2915
03:17:16,376 --> 03:17:20,179
arcane symbols, scribes, and glyphs? Or you
looking for ink that itself is actually enchanted

2916
03:17:20,179 --> 03:17:22,651
for various uses and manifestation?"

2917
03:17:22,651 --> 03:17:29,477
LIAM: No. I pull two scrolls out of my pack. I
have these. I found them in my journeys and I want

2918
03:17:29,477 --> 03:17:31,766
to make them a part of my repertoire.

2919
03:17:31,766 --> 03:17:34,755
MATT: "Oh, that's some wizard stuff. Okay, we can
do that."

2920
03:17:34,755 --> 03:17:38,805
(laughter)

2921
03:17:38,805 --> 03:17:43,371
MATT: He goes ahead and they muster the paper and
ink that will easily be utilized for scribing.

2922
03:17:43,371 --> 03:17:46,979
LIAM: Matt, I love you so much.

2923
03:17:46,979 --> 03:17:53,853
(laughter)

2924
03:17:53,853 --> 03:17:58,496
TALIESIN: So glad we're not really outside, we're
only physically outside. We get to be at the

2925
03:17:58,496 --> 03:17:59,155
table, and it's so nice!

2926
03:17:59,155 --> 03:18:05,904
TRAVIS: Enchanter Pumat Sol, do you have any
health potions we might be able to acquire from you?

2927
03:18:05,904 --> 03:18:12,786
MATT: "We have a few in stock, actually. You want
to--" and he's like "I'm already on it." Then he

2928
03:18:12,786 --> 03:18:20,129
turns around and pulls out a large, eight vial
collecting case that he sets on the table. "That's

2929
03:18:20,129 --> 03:18:30,254
one there. And there's another. We've got a
variety of vials at your disposal, so let us know

2930
03:18:30,254 --> 03:18:32,605
what you're looking for."

2931
03:18:32,605 --> 03:18:34,975
TRAVIS: How much would a greater healing potion
run me?

2932
03:18:34,975 --> 03:18:40,686
MATT: "That? Let's see here. That would put you
back about 200 gold pieces for a single vial."

2933
03:18:40,686 --> 03:18:44,578
TRAVIS: How about one of the more basic healing
potions?

2934
03:18:44,578 --> 03:18:45,407
MATT: "A general?"

2935
03:18:45,407 --> 03:18:45,736
TRAVIS: A general, yes.

2936
03:18:45,736 --> 03:18:48,950
MATT: "That'll put you at a simple 50 gold
pieces."

2937
03:18:48,950 --> 03:18:51,278
TRAVIS: I'll take one of those.

2938
03:18:51,278 --> 03:18:55,406
MATT: "It would be my pleasure, Mr. Green Man."

2939
03:18:55,406 --> 03:18:57,714
SAM: I think I'll buy--

2940
03:18:57,714 --> 03:18:59,422
MATT: "What's your name, by the way?"

2941
03:18:59,422 --> 03:19:00,269
TRAVIS: Fjord.

2942
03:19:00,269 --> 03:19:01,455
MATT: "Fjord. Pleasure to meet you."

2943
03:19:01,455 --> 03:19:05,076
TRAVIS: Nice to meet you.

2944
03:19:05,076 --> 03:19:07,317
MATT: "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to disrespect your
invitation there. What's your name?"

2945
03:19:07,317 --> 03:19:09,309
SAM: I'm Nott! I'm just Nott! Hi! Nice to meet
you!

2946
03:19:09,309 --> 03:19:10,041
MATT: "Nice to meet you."

2947
03:19:10,041 --> 03:19:11,509
SAM: You're large!

2948
03:19:11,509 --> 03:19:12,759
MATT: "You're small."

2949
03:19:14,359 --> 03:19:21,379
SAM: Can I have one? I'll have two of those
potions, if you don't mind.

2950
03:19:21,379 --> 03:19:22,910
MATT: "Of course."

2951
03:19:22,910 --> 03:19:24,306
SAM: Is there a discount for two?

2952
03:19:24,306 --> 03:19:27,954
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

2953
03:19:27,954 --> 03:19:28,680
SAM: That would be zero.

2954
03:19:28,680 --> 03:19:29,728
(laughter)

2955
03:19:29,728 --> 03:19:37,210
MATT: "I'm sorry, but this is a business. No
discounts, but we're happy to sell for the price

2956
03:19:37,210 --> 03:19:38,821
of 50 gold apiece."

2957
03:19:38,821 --> 03:19:40,962
SAM: All right, I'll take two."

2958
03:19:40,962 --> 03:19:41,971
MATT: "All righty, thank you very much."

2959
03:19:41,971 --> 03:19:45,331
LAURA: Enchanter Purvon-- Permansol?

2960
03:19:45,331 --> 03:19:46,426
MATT: "Pumat Sol."

2961
03:19:46,426 --> 03:19:49,572
LAURA: Pooman Sol.

2962
03:19:49,572 --> 03:19:50,535
SAM: Pumat.

2963
03:19:50,535 --> 03:19:51,380
LAURA: Pumat Sol.

2964
03:19:51,380 --> 03:19:53,753
TALIESIN: It's like "Poor Matt's soul."

2965
03:19:53,753 --> 03:19:56,698
LAURA and MARISHA: Poor Matt's soul!

2966
03:19:56,698 --> 03:19:58,180
MARISHA: It feels very meta.

2967
03:19:58,180 --> 03:20:01,607
LAURA: Do you guys deal in magical weapons here?

2968
03:20:01,607 --> 03:20:05,202
MATT: "We deal with all sorts of enchanted items."
He turns as one of the other guys over there goes,

2969
03:20:05,202 --> 03:20:12,522
"I've got it. We have all manner of objects that
we've crafted, enchanted, and designed."

2970
03:20:12,522 --> 03:20:15,028
LAURA: Would you like to buy this?

2971
03:20:15,028 --> 03:20:18,469
MATT: "Oh, are you looking to sell or trade?"

2972
03:20:18,469 --> 03:20:21,815
LAURA: It depends on how much you want to pay for
it.

2973
03:20:21,815 --> 03:20:25,823
MATT: "Well, let's go ahead and clear off." He
takes the vials off the counter and they set a

2974
03:20:25,823 --> 03:20:33,115
space, and the three of them sit around. You hear
this voice behind this thick curtain go, "Is

2975
03:20:33,115 --> 03:20:38,637
anybody able to help me here for a minute?" "Right
there. The two of you, continue this." One of them

2976
03:20:38,637 --> 03:20:40,849
goes in the back room to help the fourth one.

2977
03:20:40,849 --> 03:20:43,191
LAURA: Does the fourth one look just like you?

2978
03:20:43,191 --> 03:20:43,912
MARISHA: There's a fourth?

2979
03:20:43,912 --> 03:20:46,204
LAURA: Yeah, there's four of them.

2980
03:20:46,204 --> 03:20:49,702
MARISHA: I thought there was three.

2981
03:20:49,702 --> 03:20:55,565
MATT: "That's Pumat Prime. He's the real guy. But
anyway, let's have a look at this." You put down

2982
03:20:55,565 --> 03:21:01,513
the glaive, you said? "This isn't too bad." Hand
me the item card.

2983
03:21:06,483 --> 03:21:07,568
LAURA: Fleshrender.

2984
03:21:07,568 --> 03:21:17,430
LIAM: Meanwhile, I take every gold piece I have in
a little sack, plus 20 silver, which is exactly

2985
03:21:17,430 --> 03:21:20,686
150, and I am out of money.

2986
03:21:20,686 --> 03:21:25,537
MATT: With that, they happily pass over to you
your purchased parchment and ink.

2987
03:21:27,467 --> 03:21:31,430
TRAVIS: How much is that glaive worth?

2988
03:21:31,430 --> 03:21:36,698
MATT: "This is pretty well made for being such a
ghastly-looking design. I think it could easily

2989
03:21:36,698 --> 03:21:41,733
use some fine gold gilding, maybe some extra
polishing. Put some ribbons on it and this thing

2990
03:21:41,733 --> 03:21:47,583
would be a great ceremonial piece. The manticore
spines I think are a little garish, personally,

2991
03:21:47,583 --> 03:21:54,763
but if you're looking to sell, we could give this
to you for about 300 gold."

2992
03:21:54,763 --> 03:21:56,704
LIAM: Insight check.

2993
03:21:56,704 --> 03:21:58,739
MATT: Go for it.

2994
03:21:58,739 --> 03:22:00,558
LIAM: That is a 17.

2995
03:22:01,298 --> 03:22:02,579
ALL: Ooh!

2996
03:22:02,579 --> 03:22:04,213
SAM: What are you insighting?

2997
03:22:04,213 --> 03:22:05,513
LAURA: To see if he's--

2998
03:22:05,513 --> 03:22:06,703
MARISHA: Giving a good deal.

2999
03:22:06,703 --> 03:22:09,553
LIAM: I looked at the paper, motherfucker.

3000
03:22:09,553 --> 03:22:12,503
TALIESIN: (whispering) I'm going to kill you.

3001
03:22:12,503 --> 03:22:14,801
MARISHA: (whispering) Seven days.

3002
03:22:14,801 --> 03:22:16,895
LAURA: I feel like this guy's a good guy.

3003
03:22:18,169 --> 03:22:19,059
SAM: You just died.

3004
03:22:21,709 --> 03:22:23,704
LIAM: Yeah, I have to make a new character, guys,
I'm sorry.

3005
03:22:23,704 --> 03:22:28,285
LAURA: What do you think, Caleb?

3006
03:22:28,285 --> 03:22:28,572
LIAM: I think that he's just dealing with used
items.

3007
03:22:28,572 --> 03:22:29,875
LAURA: I don't know what that means.

3008
03:22:29,875 --> 03:22:32,672
LIAM: You could work him for a little bit, not a
lot.

3009
03:22:32,672 --> 03:22:42,452
MATT: "Mind you, if we're doing it for trade,
prices can be a little more in your favor, but

3010
03:22:42,452 --> 03:22:44,643
understand, I'm a business for profit."

3011
03:22:44,643 --> 03:22:51,378
LAURA: You said it needs a little decoration. I
take the ribbon off my horn and I wrap it around

3012
03:22:51,378 --> 03:22:52,198
the handle and I tie it on. What about now?

3013
03:22:52,198 --> 03:22:55,330
MATT: "That's adorable. And I'm not going to lie,
I like it better."

3014
03:22:55,330 --> 03:23:03,891
(laughter)

3015
03:23:03,891 --> 03:23:11,724
MATT: "302 gold. But for trade, I'll probably be
able to muster a little more. What are you looking for?"

3016
03:23:12,714 --> 03:23:23,493
LAURA: We are looking for something that can hold
a lot of doughnuts in it, and also maybe some

3017
03:23:23,493 --> 03:23:25,855
other things that are heavy.

3018
03:23:26,455 --> 03:23:32,382
MATT: "Let me have a look here and see what we can
muster. You're looking for something that could--

3019
03:23:32,382 --> 03:23:37,536
you traveling type? Is that right?"

3020
03:23:42,246 --> 03:23:44,138
SAM: Yes. Like a briefcase of carrying.

3021
03:23:45,748 --> 03:23:47,107
MATT: "A briefcase of carrying?"

3022
03:23:47,107 --> 03:23:48,071
SAM: A backpack of--

3023
03:23:48,071 --> 03:23:49,111
TRAVIS: A knapsack of--

3024
03:23:49,111 --> 03:23:50,398
LIAM: A short case of--

3025
03:23:53,018 --> 03:23:55,189
TALIESIN: A clutch of objects.

3026
03:23:55,189 --> 03:23:56,346
MARISHA: A handbag of endless bottom.

3027
03:23:56,346 --> 03:23:57,634
LIAM: A cheat code, if you will.

3028
03:23:59,464 --> 03:24:07,417
MATT: "I'll tell you what. If you give me this
here majestic weapon, with the ribbon included,

3029
03:24:08,447 --> 03:24:14,976
and an additional 200 gold pieces on top of that
trade, I can just go ahead--" and the other guy

3030
03:24:14,976 --> 03:24:22,143
who's wandered away goes, "We can take this here
fantastic haversack off the wall and make it yours.

3031
03:24:23,374 --> 03:24:25,532
LAURA: Is this fantastic haversack--

3032
03:24:25,532 --> 03:24:27,501
MARISHA: A Bag of Holding?

3033
03:24:27,501 --> 03:24:30,924
MATT: "Let me show you." He sets it down, and it's
this--

3034
03:24:30,925 --> 03:24:33,724
MARISHA: Is he beating us at our own game?

3035
03:24:33,724 --> 03:24:38,687
MATT: It's a backpack with a bunch of various
pouches and things that are latched onto it.

3036
03:24:38,687 --> 03:24:48,497
There's two side pouches on it beyond the big
central one. He opens it up, takes the glaive,

3037
03:24:48,497 --> 03:24:54,521
and, "Watch this!" and it disappears into it. He
reaches in, pulls the glaive out.

3038
03:24:54,521 --> 03:24:58,253
LAURA: Whoa. That's pretty cool.

3039
03:24:58,253 --> 03:24:59,787
SAM: That looks like the thing that we need.

3040
03:25:01,487 --> 03:25:06,737
MATT: It sticks in there. The big, central pouch.
He goes, "The side ones don't carry as much, but

3041
03:25:06,737 --> 03:25:11,473
the central side of it does manage to carry about
eight cubic feet of material in an

3042
03:25:11,473 --> 03:25:16,050
extra-dimensional space to call it whenever you
require it. Two cubic feet for both of the side

3043
03:25:16,050 --> 03:25:21,138
pouches. I enchanted it. Well, he enchanted it. We
sell it."

3044
03:25:25,208 --> 03:25:31,527
LAURA: If we make this deal, does it come with a
regular healing potion inside of it, maybe?

3045
03:25:32,477 --> 03:25:34,040
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

3046
03:25:36,140 --> 03:25:37,689
MARISHA: Regular potion, regular potion.

3047
03:25:37,689 --> 03:25:39,949
LIAM: Come on, La.

3048
03:25:39,949 --> 03:25:42,536
SAM: I mean, that's cocked a little bit.

3049
03:25:42,536 --> 03:25:45,540
LAURA: It is a little cocked, but barely cocked.
Ten.

3050
03:25:47,450 --> 03:25:58,834
MATT: "I appreciate your gusto. Were perhaps we
had more of a business relationship together, I

3051
03:25:58,834 --> 03:26:04,437
would consider such a deal, but as this is the
first real transaction and time in which we have

3052
03:26:04,437 --> 03:26:10,481
encountered you and your band of once-filthy
travelers, I'm going to have to decline."

3053
03:26:10,481 --> 03:26:14,822
TRAVIS: Jester, Wand of Smiles. What about for the
wand, too?

3054
03:26:14,822 --> 03:26:16,280
LAURA: I really like it.

3055
03:26:16,280 --> 03:26:18,510
SAM: It's a good wand. It's a good stick.

3056
03:26:18,520 --> 03:26:22,490
LAURA: It is a real good stick. I'm going to keep
it.

3057
03:26:22,490 --> 03:26:24,990
TRAVIS: You might need a good laugh.

3058
03:26:24,990 --> 03:26:27,560
TALIESIN: I can think of uses for that. I'm not
here, goddamn it.

3059
03:26:27,560 --> 03:26:30,220
SAM: We need that sack!

3060
03:26:30,220 --> 03:26:37,621
LIAM: Jester. Shits and giggles or utility, is the
question here.

3061
03:26:37,621 --> 03:26:41,705
LAURA: Utility here, I'm buying this sack for all
of us here.

3062
03:26:41,705 --> 03:26:43,732
SAM: We need this sack to keep our stuff in it.

3063
03:26:43,732 --> 03:26:45,492
LIAM: You have enough gold to cover it?

3064
03:26:45,492 --> 03:26:48,862
LAURA: Of course. And don't worry, once my mom
sends me my care package, we'll have thousands

3065
03:26:48,862 --> 03:26:51,502
upon thousands of gold.

3066
03:26:54,222 --> 03:26:56,296
MATT: "So is that a deal?"

3067
03:26:56,919 --> 03:27:04,114
LAURA: 200 gold for this beautiful bag. But! I
feel like it could be a little prettier. Is there

3068
03:27:04,114 --> 03:27:06,597
anything you can do to make it prettier for us?

3069
03:27:09,227 --> 03:27:14,847
MATT: "Give me just a moment." He turns around and
disappears behind the curtain and you hear some

3070
03:27:14,847 --> 03:27:23,961
talking. Some (inaudible conversation). Another
one emerges from behind the curtain who has this

3071
03:27:23,961 --> 03:27:28,912
leather band on his head with this large
magnifying-type tool hanging in front of him with

3072
03:27:28,912 --> 03:27:33,749
this big smile on his face. He has these thick
leather gloves that have a bunch of runes on them.

3073
03:27:33,749 --> 03:27:37,509
He goes, "I'm sorry, I was summoned to make
something prettier?"

3074
03:27:37,509 --> 03:27:42,254
LAURA: I'd really like, you know, pretty. I'm
going to be carrying it, I'd like it to match my outfit.

3075
03:27:42,254 --> 03:27:44,411
MATT: "What's your favorite color?"

3076
03:27:44,411 --> 03:27:45,468
LAURA: Pink!

3077
03:27:47,498 --> 03:27:53,009
MATT: (Arcane incantation) He finishes and he
watches the haversack suddenly shimmers past, and

3078
03:27:53,009 --> 03:27:56,188
the dull, general, brown leather turns to a
bright, vibrant pink.

3079
03:27:56,188 --> 03:28:00,441
LAURA: Ah! It's beautiful! 200 gold, here you go.

3080
03:28:00,441 --> 03:28:04,409
MATT: You hand it to the one guy, who accepts it.
"All right, good. I hope you enjoy it. I'm going

3081
03:28:04,409 --> 03:28:10,767
to get back to work. Keep it up, me." He goes in
the back room. He takes the glaive off. The other

3082
03:28:10,767 --> 03:28:14,141
guy says, "All right, thank you very much. Any
other business you require?"

3083
03:28:15,501 --> 03:28:16,329
LAURA: Nope.

3084
03:28:16,329 --> 03:28:19,751
SAM: You need some pastries, but we'd need
somewhere else.

3085
03:28:19,751 --> 03:28:23,506
LAURA: We'll go somewhere else for that. I doubt
you guys sell pastries.

3086
03:28:23,506 --> 03:28:29,452
MATT: "There's plenty of vendors. With the raining
outside and so late, probably hard to find

3087
03:28:29,452 --> 03:28:34,195
pastries tonight, but fresh in the morning, just
let your nose carry you around. The Pentamarket

3088
03:28:34,195 --> 03:28:35,074
has plenty."

3089
03:28:35,074 --> 03:28:39,744
TRAVIS: I will take one extra of those potions.
It's such a good deal. Here's another 50 gold.

3090
03:28:39,744 --> 03:28:41,430
MATT: "It would be my pleasure."

3091
03:28:41,430 --> 03:28:42,326
TRAVIS: Thanks.

3092
03:28:43,476 --> 03:28:51,952
LAURA: Do you know what's the blacksmith, if the--
where did I write it, it disappeared-- the Spark

3093
03:28:51,952 --> 03:28:55,419
Hammer Smithing would still be open right now, or
are they going to be closed?

3094
03:28:55,419 --> 03:29:01,002
MATT: "They're probably still working. You can
maybe convince them to take a conversation."

3095
03:29:01,002 --> 03:29:04,500
LAURA: Okie dokie. Thank you so much.

3096
03:29:04,500 --> 03:29:12,190
MATT: "No worries. Just listen for the clanging
and the sparks. All right, if that's all, I wish

3097
03:29:12,190 --> 03:29:17,860
you all adieu, come back any time. We're happy to
sell, buy, trade, and generally help out anyone

3098
03:29:17,860 --> 03:29:19,234
who has money."

3099
03:29:19,234 --> 03:29:23,210
LAURA: Man, I want to learn that trick real bad.

3100
03:29:23,210 --> 03:29:26,301
SAM: Which trick? Oh, the pink-ify?

3101
03:29:26,301 --> 03:29:30,456
LAURA: No, where you make real versions of
yourself that you get to hang out with!

3102
03:29:30,456 --> 03:29:33,691
TRAVIS: Thank you for your time.

3103
03:29:33,691 --> 03:29:35,571
MATT: "It's my pleasure."

3104
03:29:35,571 --> 03:29:45,356
TALIESIN: Did we find mulled wine? Did we find a
wine vendor?

3105
03:29:45,356 --> 03:29:49,211
MATT: Oh yeah. No, especially with it so cold
outside, you can see there were two different

3106
03:29:49,211 --> 03:29:54,781
carts that had small, pot-heated, basic alcohol
and ciders.

3107
03:29:54,781 --> 03:29:59,649
TALIESIN: If there were any little confectionaries
with that too, we would have bought whatever they

3108
03:29:59,649 --> 03:30:00,470
had left.

3109
03:30:00,470 --> 03:30:03,226
MARISHA: We buy pastries for Jester.

3110
03:30:03,226 --> 03:30:08,259
LIAM: Also, where in the year are we in relation
to Winter's Crest?

3111
03:30:08,259 --> 03:30:12,679
MATT: Winter's Crest is actually only celebrated
in Tal'Dorei. It does not have cultural

3112
03:30:12,679 --> 03:30:18,183
significance here in Wildemount. I believe you are
three to four months out from it. I'll have to

3113
03:30:18,183 --> 03:30:21,160
check the calendar. You guys are just now cresting
into the beginning of fall.

3114
03:30:21,160 --> 03:30:22,436
LIAM: Okay. Good.

3115
03:30:24,466 --> 03:30:29,791
MATT: As you guys step outside, you are
immediately met by Beauregard and Molly, who have

3116
03:30:29,791 --> 03:30:36,846
come back with some small wooden cups filled with
heated, steaming mulled wine and a small care

3117
03:30:36,846 --> 03:30:45,292
package of baked goods. Which would mark you guys
off at about, I'd say total of six silver for the bunch.

3118
03:30:45,292 --> 03:30:46,251
TALIESIN: I got it.

3119
03:30:46,251 --> 03:30:47,261
SAM: I need the tarts.

3120
03:30:47,261 --> 03:30:50,854
LAURA: Why do you need them? I like them.

3121
03:30:50,854 --> 03:30:53,149
SAM: I cast spells with them. I need just a
couple.

3122
03:30:53,149 --> 03:30:54,659
LAURA: But I like to eat them.

3123
03:30:54,659 --> 03:30:55,988
SAM: Okay, but I need them.

3124
03:30:55,988 --> 03:30:57,556
TALIESIN: We bought enough for everybody.

3125
03:30:57,556 --> 03:30:58,424
SAM: I'll take two.

3126
03:30:58,424 --> 03:30:59,838
LIAM: (Napoleon Dynamite voice) Jester, 
give me your tarts!

3127
03:30:59,838 --> 03:31:04,392
LAURA: How many tarts do I have?

3128
03:31:04,392 --> 03:31:05,819
MATT: How many did you buy?

3129
03:31:05,819 --> 03:31:08,244
MARISHA: A solid baker's dozen.

3130
03:31:08,244 --> 03:31:11,512
LAURA: Then we all eat them.

3131
03:31:11,512 --> 03:31:13,861
MARISHA and TALIESIN: I have one.

3132
03:31:15,701 --> 03:31:18,263
MATT: You may have to come back and buy more tarts
in the morning.

3133
03:31:20,493 --> 03:31:23,848
MARISHA: If you want one. Do you want one? No,
Fjord's good.

3134
03:31:23,848 --> 03:31:27,050
LAURA: I have six left. That's okay, I have six
left.

3135
03:31:27,050 --> 03:31:32,051
TALIESIN: They're really bright and garish. Really
good.

3136
03:31:32,051 --> 03:31:34,432
LIAM: Red velvet. It's good.

3137
03:31:34,432 --> 03:31:42,216
LAURA: Can we say we go and try to sell some of
this stuff, or do you guys want to do this next time?

3138
03:31:42,216 --> 03:31:46,918
MATT: I was going to say, because you guys got to
get going pretty soon. What we can do is we can

3139
03:31:46,918 --> 03:31:51,591
say at this point in the evening, it looks like
the blacksmithy is currently closed off to any

3140
03:31:51,591 --> 03:31:56,150
sort of wares-selling. They're in the process of
creation. You can hear the banging, but upon

3141
03:31:56,150 --> 03:32:00,530
knocking, they don't stop their stride of whatever
sort of work they're doing inside with the anvil.

3142
03:32:00,530 --> 03:32:08,630
The rain begins to let up a little bit. It's still
sprinkling, but at least the heavy downpour has

3143
03:32:08,630 --> 03:32:12,860
subsided a bit. You make your way through the
slushy mud pits that the streets have become,

3144
03:32:12,860 --> 03:32:20,999
weaving your way between horses and various wagons
being pulled through, individuals that are hooded

3145
03:32:20,999 --> 03:32:28,547
and bundled making their way around. Eventually
discovering the outskirts of the Leaky Tap. As you

3146
03:32:28,547 --> 03:32:34,736
guys step into the warm interior, pulling your
hoods back, we'll pick up on that next week. We've

3147
03:32:34,736 --> 03:32:38,523
got these guys have way too early flights to go to
this convention tomorrow.

3148
03:32:38,523 --> 03:32:40,848
LIAM: What time of day is it as we arrive at the
Leaky Tap?

3149
03:32:40,848 --> 03:32:43,200
MATT: It's about an hour and a half past dusk.

3150
03:32:43,200 --> 03:32:46,733
LAURA: Thank you guys for getting pastries for all
of us. That was so sweet.

3151
03:32:46,733 --> 03:32:53,464
SAM: Those men were incredible. The Canadians.

3152
03:32:53,464 --> 03:32:58,855
TALIESIN: It's the stuff they serve at the German
Christmas markets. There's pastry and mulled wine everywhere.

3153
03:32:58,855 --> 03:33:02,346
TRAVIS: He is instantly at the top.

3154
03:33:02,346 --> 03:33:04,477
LIAM: Where did those cow men come from, Matt?

3155
03:33:04,477 --> 03:33:06,648
TRAVIS: The facial configuration, too.

3156
03:33:06,648 --> 03:33:07,743
LIAM: Where does firbolg come from?

3157
03:33:07,743 --> 03:33:09,845
MARISHA: One of my favorites.

3158
03:33:09,845 --> 03:33:13,780
MATT: Just world building. Probably fever dream
while I'm working on this stuff.

3159
03:33:13,780 --> 03:33:16,792
TRAVIS: I wish there was more of me.

3160
03:33:16,792 --> 03:33:20,548
MARISHA: Nyquil does some weird shit.

3161
03:33:20,548 --> 03:33:24,114
MATT: (Pumat Sol voice) Just come back and try and
buy and trade for more things. You know where to

3162
03:33:24,114 --> 03:33:24,885
find them.

3163
03:33:24,885 --> 03:33:25,135
TRAVIS: Fuck, so good.

3164
03:33:25,135 --> 03:33:31,122
LIAM: (Pumat Sol voice) Just been writing campaign
lore for too long.

3165
03:33:31,122 --> 03:33:35,914
MATT: Awesome. Thank you, guys. We'll pick it up
next week from that point, now that you've finally

3166
03:33:35,914 --> 03:33:43,998
found your way to Zadash. This sprawling city.
Thank you guys so much for being patient. Thank

3167
03:33:43,998 --> 03:33:49,655
you for watching, I hope you enjoyed the show. Go
visit these guys at Emerald City Comic Con if you

3168
03:33:49,655 --> 03:33:55,437
have the opportunity. Isn't Khary there as well,
yeah? You can go say hi to Shakäste himself.

3169
03:33:55,437 --> 03:33:57,352
LAURA: There's so many people there. It's going to
be so much fun.

3170
03:33:57,352 --> 03:34:00,672
LIAM: Swamp Khary Payton with CR love. Swamp him.

3171
03:34:00,672 --> 03:34:06,045
MATT: As we do with every guest. Give him the
Critter hug. Yeah guys, have a wonderful week,

3172
03:34:06,045 --> 03:34:09,383
rest up, and is it Thursday yet? Good night.

3173
03:34:09,383 --> 03:34:19,138
