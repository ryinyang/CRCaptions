00:00:00,288 --> 00:00:03,218
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:03,218 --> 00:00:06,003
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

3
00:00:06,003 --> 00:00:08,207
TRAVIS: Yeah, we do!

4
00:00:08,207 --> 00:00:14,350
MATT: Apparently, someone's got mail on Drag
Race!

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:19,188
LIAM: That was like standing at the dock going,
"Three, two, one, jump!" and Travis was the only

6
00:00:19,188 --> 00:00:20,559
one who jumped in.

7
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:25,145
MATT: Yeah, well done, though. Welcome guys! Before
we jump into tonight's episode, we have some

8
00:00:25,145 --> 00:00:29,106
announcements to get through. First and foremost,
returning once again this week, our fantastic

9
00:00:29,106 --> 00:00:36,792

campaign, D&amp;D Beyond! An awesome Dungeons &amp;

10
00:00:36,792 --> 00:00:41,232
Dragons tool for use for your campaigns, whether
you be DM or player, and Sam, do you have anything

11
00:00:41,232 --> 00:00:42,584
to say about that?

12
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:50,265
SAM: Hi! Hey, our partner this week is D&amp;D Beyond,
that's www.dndbeyond.com. They'd like to invite

another contest, all of you can play, and here's

18
00:01:23,972 --> 00:01:30,752
the rules: using D&amp;D Beyond, you have to create a
character, right now, a level three character, any

19
00:01:30,752 --> 00:01:31,945
character, go!

20
00:01:31,945 --> 00:01:32,975
MARISHA: On our app?

21
00:01:32,975 --> 00:01:35,442
LAURA: What?! That's going to take so long!

22
00:01:35,442 --> 00:01:38,189
SAM: (intense timer countdown song)

23
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:42,779
MARISHA: Hang on, it's refreshing! You should've
given us warning!

24
00:01:42,779 --> 00:01:52,773
SAM: (singing) D&amp;D&amp;D&amp;D Beyond. D&amp;D Beyond! D&amp;D!

25
00:01:52,773 --> 00:01:53,894
LAURA: I did it!

26
00:01:53,894 --> 00:01:54,977
TALIESIN: Aw, damn it!

27
00:01:54,977 --> 00:01:57,357
SAM: What? I don't see it. It's there. She did
it.

28
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,239
LAURA and TALIESIN: I did it!

29
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,807
LIAM: Sphincter, Sphincter, Sphincter!

30
00:02:00,807 --> 00:02:04,354
SAM: Oh, you know what? I don't know how to call
it!

31
00:02:04,354 --> 00:02:06,265
LAURA: I have 138 hit points?

32
00:02:06,265 --> 00:02:10,380
SAM: Wow! Wait, at a level three character? No,
she's level 15!

33
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,456
TALIESIN: Callous, 25 hit points! Already done,
right there!

34
00:02:13,456 --> 00:02:18,992
SAM: All right, Taliesin wins. See how easy it is
to create a character with D&amp;D Beyond?

35
00:02:18,992 --> 00:02:23,211
TALIESIN: A level three blood hunter earth
elemental.

36
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:27,647
SAM: I'll give you a hint: your prize is attached
to my mug.

37
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,528
TALIESIN: Oh, no.

38
00:02:29,528 --> 00:02:35,219
Wait, wait, wait! No, leave it! Put it
back, I want to do this properly.

39
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:38,337
SAM: What're you doing?

40
00:02:38,337 --> 00:02:39,637
TALIESIN: Lift, lift, lift.

41
00:02:39,637 --> 00:02:42,341
(laughter)

42
00:02:42,341 --> 00:02:44,778
MARISHA: Did you just--

43
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:48,022
TRAVIS: You hit Randomize Your Character.

44
00:02:48,022 --> 00:02:51,267
SAM: Do you see how easy it is? We all created a
character in, like, 25 seconds!

45
00:02:51,267 --> 00:02:56,244
LAURA: This random character that I just created
is really fucking cool.

46
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:57,688
TALIESIN: I'm actually really impressed with this
fucking character.

47
00:02:57,688 --> 00:03:00,080
LIAM: Aw, I don't want to have Sphincter next to
Caleb now!

48
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,844
SAM: Wait, you really named it "Sphincter?"

49
00:03:01,844 --> 00:03:09,693
LIAM: Yes. That's the name I gave them! That's as
far as I got! Delete. Oh, there goes Caleb.

50
00:03:09,693 --> 00:03:15,502
TRAVIS: What is your name? Panalanalam-- Pana--

51
00:03:15,502 --> 00:03:17,450
MARISHA: Panlanann.

52
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,817
TRAVIS: There are four "N's" in that name.

53
00:03:19,817 --> 00:03:23,238
MARISHA: I am Panlanann, the wood half-elf blood
hunter!

54
00:03:23,238 --> 00:03:25,264
SAM: What was yours, Taliesin?

55
00:03:25,264 --> 00:03:26,387
TALIESIN: Callous.

56
00:03:26,387 --> 00:03:28,014
SAM: Callous? What was yours, Laura?

57
00:03:28,014 --> 00:03:30,508
LAURA: I was Alight, a level 15 fire genasi.

58
00:03:30,508 --> 00:03:31,577
SAM: Her name was Alight?

59
00:03:31,577 --> 00:03:32,782
LAURA: Alight.

60
00:03:32,782 --> 00:03:35,757
TRAVIS: I am Eomita Deephollow, lightfoot halfling
fighter.

61
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:43,888
MARISHA: Dude, my abilities are balls, though. I
have a five dex and a four wisdom. That's sad.

62
00:03:43,888 --> 00:03:46,014
MATT: We're using those characters for the next
campaign.

63
00:03:46,014 --> 00:03:48,100
TRAVIS: No, no, no! No!

64
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,953
MARISHA: Wait, you got dope stats!

65
00:03:49,953 --> 00:03:51,443
TRAVIS: Because I'm awesome.

66
00:03:51,443 --> 00:03:53,686
MARISHA: Look how fucking crap these are!

67
00:03:53,686 --> 00:03:55,205
TRAVIS: You're in big trouble.

68
00:03:55,205 --> 00:04:00,052
MATT: Thank you very much, Sam, congratulations
Taliesin, and thank you D&amp;D Beyond for being our

LAURA: Sam, stop touching my shit. Look at that!

76
00:04:35,496 --> 00:04:36,734
LIAM: Kids!

77
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,452
LAURA: I'm sorry. Sorry, Matthew.

78
00:04:39,452 --> 00:04:44,765
MATT: It's okay. We haven't started yet, so
technically it's a buffer. Talks Machina, next

00:04:44,765 --> 00:04:50,246
Tuesday at 7:00pm Pacific. We'll be here on Twitch

episode tonight, so check it out next week on

Tuesday. The podcast of last week's episode is
available for download, so those of you who missed

82
00:05:01,938 --> 00:05:07,137
last episode or want to listen to it on your drive

83
00:05:07,137 --> 00:05:11,789
your imagination-scape, last week's episode is
available to download now wherever finest podcasts

84
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:19,238
are located to be downloaded. Any other major
announcements from you guys?

85
00:05:19,238 --> 00:05:23,990
LIAM: A little thing that is totally improvised. A
couple of weeks ago, a Critter named Courtney--

86
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,445
forgive me if I'm getting that wrong-- She tweeted
a picture of her with this scarf that she was

87
00:05:28,445 --> 00:05:33,776
making for Caleb, and she made the hashtag
#ScarvesForCaleb and then people started talking

88
00:05:33,776 --> 00:05:39,712
about it. I retweeted because I thought it was
awesome, and they came up with the idea to make

89
00:05:39,712 --> 00:05:46,782
scarves for Caleb-- But not for me-- to give to
shelters: Homeless shelters, to veterans, to

90
00:05:46,782 --> 00:05:50,209
anyone who needs scarves or hats or mittens. I
think it's a great idea, and you would make me

91
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:56,256
happy. This is beautiful, I love it, thank you,
but don't pile me up in scarves. Send them to

92
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:58,260
people who need them. I just think it would be a
nice thing to do.

93
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:07,002
MATT: That's awesome guys, I love it. Once again,
826LA, our fantastic charity we've been supporting

94
00:06:07,002 --> 00:06:11,532
since the very beginning of this show, almost three
years ago now. They do fantastic work. If you

95
00:06:11,532 --> 00:06:16,656
have the opportunity to give your time to it, or
want to help donate, or at least look up and see

96
00:06:16,656 --> 00:06:22,817
what they do, I recommend you do it, they are
fantastic, so thank you guys. Unless anybody else

97
00:06:22,817 --> 00:06:31,209
has anything else to interject, I believe it's
time for us to jump in to tonight's episode of

98
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:33,447
Critical Role.

99
00:06:33,447 --> 00:06:37,010
[click, TV static]

100
00:06:37,010 --> 00:07:55,035
[groovy Critical Role theme]

101
00:07:55,035 --> 00:08:08,701
MATT: Welcome back. You guys are getting sloppy.
Welcome back. Last we left off, our gathering of

102
00:08:08,701 --> 00:08:14,352
friends have been traversing northward along the
Amber Road, with the distant destination of

103
00:08:14,352 --> 00:08:19,732
Zadash, one of the larger cities of the Dwendalian
Empire, as your destination. Upon traveling, you

104
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:26,154
passed a caravan, spent an evening amongst trees,
where you found a wayward cluster of wandering

105
00:08:26,154 --> 00:08:37,512
buffalo...-like creatures. You continued northward
for a second day, rushed on past sunset to rest in

106
00:08:37,512 --> 00:08:44,037
the city of Alfield, a small farming town that's
along the way to Zadash. However, upon noticing

107
00:08:44,037 --> 00:08:51,525
that some of the buildings in the eastern side of
town began to light up with flame, you began to

108
00:08:51,525 --> 00:08:56,450
approach rather rapidly, seeing members of the
city, citizens fleeing and screaming, and there

109
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:00,816
seemed to be some sort of attack. Upon going into
the town, you realized that a number of these

110
00:09:00,816 --> 00:09:06,598
buildings are being set fire by an incursion of
gnolls. You were immediately brought in by

111
00:09:06,598 --> 00:09:14,521
Watchmaster Bryce, who offered to pay you for each
set of gnoll ears that were brought to them, and

112
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:21,385
you jumped into the fray, managed to kill quite a
few, many of them still left with their quarry, it

113
00:09:21,385 --> 00:09:27,480
seems, which happened to be quite a number of
bodies and/or citizens still living, that were

114
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:35,088
dragged off into the ashen and cloud-covered
night. Upon returning, many of you bruised,

115
00:09:35,088 --> 00:09:45,075
beaten, and at one point in danger of worse, you
were given an evening's rest at the Feed and Mead

116
00:09:45,075 --> 00:09:51,091
Tavern, and were told, if you were interested in
pursuing future coin in helping with the current

117
00:09:51,091 --> 00:10:00,790
conflict nearing the city, to meet Bryce out by
the Broad Barn.

118
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,591
ALL: The Broad Barn.

119
00:10:02,591 --> 00:10:03,898
LAURA: That's why I wrote Broad Barn down.

120
00:10:03,898 --> 00:10:04,923
MATT: That is why.

121
00:10:04,923 --> 00:10:06,604
LIAM: I wrote "Rod Barn."

122
00:10:06,604 --> 00:10:15,992
MATT: That's a different place entirely. You guys
all bundled up into a singular room above the

123
00:10:15,992 --> 00:10:23,680
floor of the Feed and Mead. Found yourselves
exhausted, passed out, and got an evening's rest,

124
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:30,247
so you've all gotten a long rest. You've healed
up. You've recovered your abilities. As the

125
00:10:30,247 --> 00:10:37,702
uncomfortable warmth of the morning kicks in, with
your small room and number of warm bodies

126
00:10:37,702 --> 00:10:45,538
encompassing a very tight and not very drafty
space, the partially humid early hours draw you

127
00:10:45,538 --> 00:10:52,730
from consciousness. You all begin to stretch your
sore muscles and decide what endeavors await you

128
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,941
with the new day. What do you guys want to do?

129
00:10:55,941 --> 00:10:58,853
LAURA: What do you guys want to do today?

130
00:10:58,853 --> 00:11:03,589
TRAVIS: That bed was not my favorite.

131
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:05,076
LAURA: I liked it.

132
00:11:05,076 --> 00:11:06,651
TRAVIS: Little stiff.

133
00:11:06,651 --> 00:11:11,239
MARISHA: You should try sleeping on the floor.
It's actually really good support.

134
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:13,577
TALIESIN: It's good for your back, it's really
true.

135
00:11:13,577 --> 00:11:16,186
TRAVIS: You use a pillow, or are you just on the
floor?

136
00:11:16,186 --> 00:11:17,532
TALIESIN: Pillow.

137
00:11:17,532 --> 00:11:20,559
(laughter)

138
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:25,846
TRAVIS: Do you have to pray over your swords or
anything this morning?

139
00:11:25,846 --> 00:11:30,861
TALIESIN: No, everything's fine. They just do what
they need to do. I just have to keep them clean.

140
00:11:30,861 --> 00:11:36,231
TRAVIS: Yeah, well, we were sharing a room one
night, and Molly has a ritual. I think it's part

141
00:11:36,231 --> 00:11:42,575
of his custom. Yeah, he performs over his swords.

142
00:11:42,575 --> 00:11:46,448
TALIESIN: I have to take care of them or else
they'll stop working, of course.

143
00:11:46,448 --> 00:11:48,290
MARISHA: Sure.

144
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,978
LAURA: Do they need to feed?

145
00:11:49,978 --> 00:11:55,112
TALIESIN: They do actually, yeah. I've got to feed
them some, well-- it's complicated. I don't like

146
00:11:55,112 --> 00:12:01,902
to go too deep into it, but I've got to use my
bloodline on occasion. Actually, since we're

147
00:12:01,902 --> 00:12:05,172
already on the road, I should be honest, I wasn't
entirely telling the truth when I talked to you

148
00:12:05,172 --> 00:12:06,780
that night.

149
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,695
TRAVIS: No! Stop it!

150
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:10,344
SAM: You seem so honest.

151
00:12:10,344 --> 00:12:14,194
TALIESIN: Oh, you're just a bundle of truth too,
aren't you?

152
00:12:14,194 --> 00:12:16,651
LIAM: What is a bloodline?

153
00:12:16,651 --> 00:12:26,729
TALIESIN: I suppose it's only fair. I did tell you
that these swords are special, and that they use

154
00:12:26,729 --> 00:12:35,010
the blood of my family to activate themselves. I
know I might have said I was from a long line of

155
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,433
priests, and--

156
00:12:36,433 --> 00:12:38,260
MARISHA: Oh my god, you killed your whole family.

157
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,573
TALIESIN: I didn't kill my whole family.

158
00:12:39,573 --> 00:12:41,686
MARISHA: Oh, okay. Never mind, keep going. I'm
sorry.

159
00:12:41,686 --> 00:12:49,884
TALIESIN: Our family were less the priests, and
more the sacrifices. We may have stolen the swords

160
00:12:49,884 --> 00:13:00,656
and run. That's why I've been trying to keep a bit
of a low profile when it comes to some of the authorities.

161
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:03,095
TRAVIS: Yeah. I mean, for fear of your life you
ran?

162
00:13:03,095 --> 00:13:05,613
TALIESIN: It's been a long time, but I'd rather
not run into them.

163
00:13:05,613 --> 00:13:08,259
LAURA: What gods were you being sacrificed to?

164
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:12,215
TALIESIN: Oh, I couldn't tell you. It was my
parents, I was just wee by the time that happened.

165
00:13:12,215 --> 00:13:16,640
SAM: Is there a roving band of priests that are
trying to find you right now?

166
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,943
TALIESIN: Oh, I hope not. I mean, it's been a long
time.

167
00:13:19,943 --> 00:13:23,204
MARISHA: Where's home? Where is this place that
you stole--

168
00:13:23,204 --> 00:13:28,151
TALIESIN: My parents never spoke of it. Somewhere
out east.

169
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:31,073
LIAM: You got to the circus from that, how?

170
00:13:31,073 --> 00:13:37,738
TALIESIN: Well, it was a bit of a mess, but I just
ended up there eventually. Just looking for a

171
00:13:37,738 --> 00:13:41,555
place where I could rest, I suppose?

172
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:44,329
LIAM: That's funny, you gave me an answer, but you
didn't really give me an answer.

173
00:13:44,329 --> 00:13:46,878
TALIESIN: Well, I don't know you that well.

174
00:13:46,878 --> 00:13:50,030
MARISHA: That's what he's been doing this whole
time.

175
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,468
TALIESIN: That requires a drink.

176
00:13:51,468 --> 00:13:54,880
TRAVIS: I understand that sentiment. Trying to
find a little respite, a little peace.

177
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,359
TALIESIN: It's a good place to be if you want to
run, but not run.

178
00:13:58,359 --> 00:14:02,642
SAM: Are there any others of your family out there
on the run?

179
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:04,328
TALIESIN: Not that I've ever met.

180
00:14:04,328 --> 00:14:08,794
LAURA: Was it just your parents and you that were
being sacrificed?

181
00:14:08,794 --> 00:14:11,893
TALIESIN: You know, I don't know. I never thought
to ask.

182
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:15,126
LAURA: Did they want to kill you or just take your
blood?

183
00:14:15,126 --> 00:14:17,778
TALIESIN: Apparently they needed us alive for it,
so there was that.

184
00:14:17,778 --> 00:14:20,960
LAURA: Oh! So it wasn't so bad, they just slowly
drained you.

185
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,564
SAM: Doesn't sound that bad. Yeah, they're not
going to kill you.

186
00:14:23,564 --> 00:14:24,811
TALIESIN: So I was told.

187
00:14:24,811 --> 00:14:27,634
MARISHA: Isn't that what you're doing to yourself
on a daily basis?

188
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:32,356
TALIESIN: It's not that bad, though, it doesn't
leave a mark really.

189
00:14:32,356 --> 00:14:36,465
TRAVIS: You're in control of it. You're using it
for yourself?

190
00:14:36,465 --> 00:14:39,061
TALIESIN: Oh yes, of course. It can come in handy.

191
00:14:39,061 --> 00:14:41,077
LAURA: Does it have to be your blood?

192
00:14:41,077 --> 00:14:44,010
TALIESIN: Oh yes. Of our bloodline, apparently.

193
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:47,786
MARISHA: Have you tried any other bloodlines?

194
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:55,918
TALIESIN: Well, I've cut a lot of people with them.
Would you like to take a run at it? You could be lucky.

195
00:14:55,918 --> 00:14:59,121
MARISHA: I'll save that for another day.

196
00:14:59,121 --> 00:15:00,541
TALIESIN: I had a funny feeling.

197
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,408
TRAVIS: I'm tempted.

198
00:15:02,408 --> 00:15:07,895
SAM: What about you, Fjord? Are you going to vomit
any seawater this morning?

199
00:15:07,895 --> 00:15:10,145
TRAVIS: (retching)

200
00:15:10,145 --> 00:15:11,852
SAM: Oh, watch out!

201
00:15:11,852 --> 00:15:13,137
TRAVIS: Nah.

202
00:15:13,137 --> 00:15:17,192
TALIESIN: Could've been worth five copper on the
open road at one point.

203
00:15:17,192 --> 00:15:20,412
TRAVIS: I seem to have missed my calling.

204
00:15:20,412 --> 00:15:22,531
TALIESIN: Always could use a circus geek.

205
00:15:22,531 --> 00:15:27,524
MARISHA: How'd you sleep, aside from the crappy
bed?

206
00:15:27,588 --> 00:15:33,799
TRAVIS: I know what you're asking. I didn't have
any other dreams. It was fairly restful.

207
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,729
LAURA: No dreams at all?

208
00:15:35,729 --> 00:15:40,246
TRAVIS: None I care to speak of.

209
00:15:40,246 --> 00:15:43,388
LIAM: Do we think there's anything left of this
town?

210
00:15:43,388 --> 00:15:46,326
TALIESIN: That is a question.

211
00:15:46,326 --> 00:15:48,394
TRAVIS: Anything left?

212
00:15:48,394 --> 00:15:51,446
SAM: It didn't seem like the whole thing was on
fire.

213
00:15:51,446 --> 00:15:55,675
TRAVIS: We couldn't quite see it at night, that's
true. Maybe we should go down.

214
00:15:55,675 --> 00:15:59,453
LIAM: I would like to take a walk and see what it
is we're out to save.

215
00:15:59,453 --> 00:16:01,277
LAURA: We can steal some things!

216
00:16:01,277 --> 00:16:06,028
LIAM: Maybe we do that second, and first we take a
walk.

217
00:16:06,028 --> 00:16:10,515
TALIESIN: How do we get paid? There was talk of
pay.

218
00:16:10,515 --> 00:16:12,008
LAURA: I thought we already got paid.

219
00:16:12,008 --> 00:16:16,008
LIAM: We did, but Molly was drinking, so maybe he
does not remember.

220
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:18,109
TRAVIS: He said he was going to bring the rest, I
think, later.

221
00:16:18,109 --> 00:16:22,642
TALIESIN: I've got to say, there's worse ways to
make a living.

222
00:16:22,642 --> 00:16:24,757
LIAM: I counted 60 gold.

223
00:16:24,757 --> 00:16:28,040
TRAVIS: Hey, Molly, didn't you say Bryce said it
would come later?

224
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:35,193
MATT: Bryce had said if you wanted to continue to
help with this then there was more money.

225
00:16:35,193 --> 00:16:37,499
LAURA: Let's keep helping!

226
00:16:37,499 --> 00:16:42,511
MARISHA: Yeah, I mean, it's not a bad gig.

227
00:16:42,511 --> 00:16:46,003
LAURA: We could stay here forever and just kill
gnolls.

228
00:16:46,003 --> 00:16:49,114
SAM: That was very scary. One of them almost
killed me!

229
00:16:49,114 --> 00:16:51,753
LAURA: But think about how good we would get over
time.

230
00:16:51,753 --> 00:16:55,111
SAM: That's true. The 10,000-hour rule?

231
00:16:55,111 --> 00:16:56,618
LAURA: Mm-hmm!

232
00:16:56,618 --> 00:16:58,414
TALIESIN: Nott the gnoll killer.

233
00:16:58,414 --> 00:17:03,522
TRAVIS: Jester, we agreed not to put anyone in
harm's way in an excessive manner.

234
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,924
LAURA: When did we agree that?

235
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:08,807
TRAVIS: Did we not?

236
00:17:08,807 --> 00:17:10,425
LIAM: I don't remember that, either.

237
00:17:10,425 --> 00:17:12,054
TALIESIN: I don't recall making that arrangement.

238
00:17:12,054 --> 00:17:13,384
LAURA: Did we agree to that?

239
00:17:13,384 --> 00:17:19,521
TRAVIS: Maybe I thought that was an unspoken
thing.

240
00:17:19,521 --> 00:17:25,704
LAURA: Usually when you agree to something you
have to say it out loud. Most of the time. Unless

241
00:17:25,704 --> 00:17:32,274
it's, like-- We just agreed to it! You said it,
you said it!

242
00:17:32,274 --> 00:17:34,527
SAM: What did you agree to?

243
00:17:34,527 --> 00:17:41,338
LAURA: I can't tell, it's a secret! Oh! But she's
serious about it, I can tell!

244
00:17:41,338 --> 00:17:44,988
TALIESIN: You're so good at this.

245
00:17:44,988 --> 00:17:48,655
LIAM: Well, my social anxiety is getting the best
of me. I'm taking a walk. Goodbye.

246
00:17:48,655 --> 00:17:54,046
MATT: The door slams behind Caleb briskly making
his exit.

247
00:17:54,046 --> 00:18:00,388
LAURA: Do you want a donut this morning? It's a
little more stale in the bag, I have to let you know.

248
00:18:00,388 --> 00:18:01,993
TRAVIS: I think I'm fine.

249
00:18:01,993 --> 00:18:03,358
LAURA: Do you want one?

250
00:18:03,358 --> 00:18:07,073
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. More donut for us.

251
00:18:07,073 --> 00:18:11,085
MARISHA: I guess we should greet the town.

252
00:18:11,085 --> 00:18:12,138
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

253
00:18:12,138 --> 00:18:14,554
LAURA: Wait! When did we say we were going to meet
Bryce?

254
00:18:14,554 --> 00:18:17,923
SAM: Why are you yelling?

255
00:18:17,923 --> 00:18:19,921
LAURA: I thought they were leaving.

256
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:23,395
TRAVIS: Actually, I think they'll find us.

257
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:28,757
MARISHA: Yeah. Maybe we could just stand in the
middle of town and go, "Bryce?" until they show up.

258
00:18:28,757 --> 00:18:31,326
LAURA: In front of Broad Barn.

259
00:18:31,326 --> 00:18:39,360
MARISHA: Okay, I have a question about this Broad
Barn thing. Is Broad Barn the name of an

260
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:45,569
establishment, or is Broad Barn a very broad
barn?

261
00:18:45,569 --> 00:18:46,740
TALIESIN: It's a very long barn.

262
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,858
MARISHA: It's a very big barn?

263
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:51,664
LAURA: What if it's a street? We didn't clarify,
did we?

264
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:55,646
MARISHA: What if it's a tavern? I don't know, I
got confused in his delivery.

265
00:18:55,646 --> 00:18:57,572
LAURA: I bet we can ask the guy downstairs.

266
00:18:57,572 --> 00:18:58,825
MARISHA: All right, yeah.

267
00:18:58,825 --> 00:19:00,239
TALIESIN: He seemed nice last night.

268
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:04,617
TRAVIS: We go downstairs.

269
00:19:04,617 --> 00:19:06,930
TALIESIN: I'll follow for this.

270
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:15,316
LIAM: It's a Zork game. We go down the stairs.

271
00:19:15,316 --> 00:19:25,157
MATT: I know, apparently. You head downstairs to
the only other real location within the Feed and

272
00:19:25,157 --> 00:19:37,063
Mead Tavern. There's Crute still there off to the
side and one very dirty and ashy civilian who is

273
00:19:37,063 --> 00:19:44,154
currently slowly scarfing a meal with a thousand
yard stare. Looks like they had been close to the

274
00:19:44,154 --> 00:19:51,641
action and chaos the evening before. As you walk
down, Crute looks across and goes, "I see you're

275
00:19:51,641 --> 00:19:53,897
"awake. Would you like breakfast?"

276
00:19:53,897 --> 00:19:55,965
LAURA and TALIESIN: Yes, please.

277
00:19:55,965 --> 00:19:59,648
MATT: "All right. It'll be about an hour. Because
it's just me."

278
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:02,924
SAM: An hour? All right.

279
00:20:02,924 --> 00:20:05,732
MATT: "It's just me."

280
00:20:05,732 --> 00:20:10,221
LAURA: Do you want some help? I'll come help you!

281
00:20:10,221 --> 00:20:12,288
MATT: "Come on!"

282
00:20:12,288 --> 00:20:15,220
TALIESIN: I'll go in for this if it means a faster
breakfast.

283
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:25,740
MATT: The two of you jump in with Crute in what is
a not very well-kept kitchen, but functional. The

284
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,713
gristle, who knows how long it's been there. It
might add to the flavor, who knows.

285
00:20:28,713 --> 00:20:30,706
TRAVIS: A-rating for the city of Los Angeles?

286
00:20:30,706 --> 00:20:35,536
MATT: We'll put it at a B in Panorama City.

287
00:20:35,536 --> 00:20:39,616
TALIESIN: Wow, that's an in-joke.

288
00:20:39,616 --> 00:20:46,262
MATT: You guys go ahead and help out. It does
manage to cut down the time for breakfast

289
00:20:46,262 --> 00:20:49,010
preparation. Eventually food is presented.

290
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:53,020
LAURA: After we've cooked, I'm going to switch out
his salt for his sugar.

291
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,408
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.

292
00:20:55,408 --> 00:21:01,100
TALIESIN: I want to see if I see this. I don't, do
I?

293
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,509
MATT: You're too caught up in the meal-making.

294
00:21:04,509 --> 00:21:05,567
LAURA: 19.

295
00:21:05,567 --> 00:21:06,904
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, I definitely don't see this.

296
00:21:06,904 --> 00:21:11,856
MATT: Neither does Crute, as you manage to do so
swiftly. Practiced, like you've done this before

297
00:21:11,856 --> 00:21:15,808
in many other establishments in the past, maybe.

298
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:19,452
LAURA: After we cooked.

299
00:21:19,452 --> 00:21:22,192
TRAVIS: You just give us all diabetes, that's
great.

300
00:21:22,192 --> 00:21:25,246
TALIESIN: The frittatas are going to taste real
weird.

301
00:21:25,246 --> 00:21:31,209
MATT: As you guys finish your breakfast, the rest
of the day is yours.

302
00:21:31,209 --> 00:21:39,076
MARISHA: What does the town look like when we step
out front? How bad is it?

303
00:21:39,076 --> 00:21:43,987
MATT: As you emerge from the tavern-- and Caleb,
you've already seen this-- you see that the fires

304
00:21:43,987 --> 00:21:49,395
have now been reduced to maybe a dozen wide plumes
of gray-white smoke on the eastern side of the

305
00:21:49,395 --> 00:21:56,062
city. It rises from the ashes and charred wood
remains and wood frames where some buildings used

306
00:21:56,062 --> 00:22:02,668
to be. It seemed much more dangerous and chaotic
last evening, but looking at it now in the day,

307
00:22:02,668 --> 00:22:09,106
it's no more than maybe a dozen buildings or so
that were affected. They were more centralized to

308
00:22:09,106 --> 00:22:17,880
cause the most chaos suddenly at that time of
night. You get the sense as soon as you look

309
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:25,501
around that the folks of the city are on edge,
understandably so. You see the people are trying

310
00:22:25,501 --> 00:22:30,705
to pick up their lives and move on in the face of
what recently occurred. The very air holds this

311
00:22:30,705 --> 00:22:36,960
tension as you look around you. People walk past
you with sacks of grain and tools, their eyes

312
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,508
wide, darting around for unseen danger and
glancing past the two tieflings, immediately,

313
00:22:42,508 --> 00:22:49,125
instinctually step back a bit and make a wide
berth. You watch children run from doorway to

314
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:57,545
doorway, trying to stay out of the street as long
as possible. It seems like it's trying to carry

315
00:22:57,545 --> 00:23:03,153
on, but it's going to be a process. Some folks are
rummaging through the remains of the respective

316
00:23:03,153 --> 00:23:10,338
buildings. You glance over near where the central
portion of your conflict last night took place,

317
00:23:10,338 --> 00:23:18,757
where the Candleglow Tavern is, and there you see,
amongst the smoldering rubble of the inn, a single

318
00:23:18,757 --> 00:23:25,747
halfling man sifts through the wreckage, a
crownsguard helping him lift heavier beams. You

319
00:23:25,747 --> 00:23:28,701
see as he plucks what he can of his former life
from the rubble.

320
00:23:28,701 --> 00:23:33,621
SAM: Should we go over and talk to him?

321
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:34,726
LAURA: Sure.

322
00:23:34,726 --> 00:23:36,718
SAM: Do we recognize this person?

323
00:23:36,718 --> 00:23:38,512
MATT: You have not met this person, no.

324
00:23:38,512 --> 00:23:40,894
LAURA: You're a halfling, too, so maybe you should
talk to him.

325
00:23:40,894 --> 00:23:43,485
SAM: I'm not technically.

326
00:23:43,485 --> 00:23:45,103
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk over.

327
00:23:45,103 --> 00:23:51,336
SAM: I'll join. We'll just go over and scare the
shit out of him.

328
00:23:51,336 --> 00:23:55,826
TALIESIN: Need a hand?

329
00:23:55,826 --> 00:24:03,749
MATT: You can see a halfling man, maybe in his
fifth decade or so. He has ashy blond hair and a

330
00:24:03,749 --> 00:24:10,426
face cracked by smiling, though now too dour and
soot-covered to see any sort of smile on his face.

331
00:24:10,426 --> 00:24:14,719
As he pulls through some of the rubble and he's
making a small pile on the side, he looks up and

332
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:18,338
goes, "Oh, right. Can I help you?"

333
00:24:18,338 --> 00:24:22,102
TALIESIN: We were part of this commotion last
night. We were wondering if you need a hand with

334
00:24:22,102 --> 00:24:23,712
anything right now?

335
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,369
MATT: "I mean, if you don't--"

336
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:28,840
TALIESIN: I'm taking off my jacket.

337
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:36,884
MATT: "You don't have to! Okay, okay." As you dive
in, you spend the next ten minutes helping move

338
00:24:36,884 --> 00:24:41,184
through some of the heavier beams that collapsed.
There is still somewhat of a structure, mainly of

339
00:24:41,184 --> 00:24:45,655
the bottom floor, but a lot of the top floor, the
one that you were in last night, has fallen in

340
00:24:45,655 --> 00:24:51,124
over time. So it's moving some of the bigger beams
out of the way. As you're pulling through and

341
00:24:51,124 --> 00:24:57,742
moving some of the larger pieces of the structure,
the halfling man goes, "I appreciate the help.

342
00:24:57,742 --> 00:25:02,661
"Name's Thadeus. Thadeus Candleglow."

343
00:25:02,661 --> 00:25:05,177
LAURA: Oh, this was your place?

344
00:25:05,177 --> 00:25:06,785
MATT: "It was."

345
00:25:06,785 --> 00:25:08,429
LAURA: Oh, wow.

346
00:25:08,429 --> 00:25:14,015
MATT: "20 years since I was left this place. Built
by my grandpaps, Reedus."

347
00:25:14,015 --> 00:25:18,322
SAM: Were you here when the attack happened?

348
00:25:18,322 --> 00:25:26,239
MATT: "Oh, I was here. When they all came in, I
was gone. I wasn't about to stay around, you know?"

349
00:25:26,239 --> 00:25:29,998
SAM: Did you happen to see where they came from?

350
00:25:29,998 --> 00:25:34,532
MATT: "Oh, I did not. I was in the process of
cleaning dishes and dealing with a couple of my

351
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:40,443
"patrons. One of them--" and he points over to the
rubble. You can see what looks to be a skeletal

352
00:25:40,443 --> 00:25:50,405
body that's been partially collapsed. "I suppose
Leiman's probably not going to be a regular anymore."

353
00:25:50,405 --> 00:25:52,356
LAURA: Oh, no.

354
00:25:52,356 --> 00:25:56,066
TALIESIN: You going to rebuild, give him a fine
plaque?

355
00:25:56,066 --> 00:26:07,530
MATT: "Rebuilding requires something called money.
I think I'm probably going to gather what I can

356
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:11,131
"here and shop up north and see what other 
work I can get myself to."

357
00:26:11,131 --> 00:26:14,344
LAURA: How much gold do you need?

358
00:26:14,344 --> 00:26:22,965
MATT: "I don't know. A building establishment like
this. I'm not entirely certain, but I could check

359
00:26:22,965 --> 00:26:26,335
"in. I assume it's probably a few thousand gold
pieces for the structure."

360
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:35,314
LAURA: I just had that, too! I'm sorry, I don't
have it anymore. But I could try writing to my mom

361
00:26:35,314 --> 00:26:37,109
to see if she'll help you.

362
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:38,546
MATT: "That's really sweet."

363
00:26:38,546 --> 00:26:47,068
TALIESIN: Or, as another thought, since you were
basically robbed, who were they? What happened?

364
00:26:47,068 --> 00:26:48,424
Has this happened before?

365
00:26:48,424 --> 00:26:51,167
MATT: "Oh, this hasn't happened as long as I've
been here, and I've been here most of my life,

366
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:56,786
"here in Alfield. You hear about these things
wandering on the outside, and you know crownsguard

367
00:26:56,786 --> 00:27:02,047
"keeps you safe. Anything comes too close, they
just shoot them in the face with a bunch of arrows

368
00:27:02,047 --> 00:27:03,828
"and shit."

369
00:27:03,828 --> 00:27:08,326
LAURA: I love him so much!

370
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:16,823
SAM: Thadeus, did they seem to be after anything
in particular? Were they here for property or

371
00:27:16,823 --> 00:27:19,185
people or gold or food?

372
00:27:19,185 --> 00:27:25,665
MATT: "They didn't take any of the worthwhile
stuff, thankfully." He points over to a pile and

373
00:27:25,665 --> 00:27:36,610
you can see there's some brass urn or vase that's
been smashed and dented by the conflict. You can

374
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:40,919
see bits and pieces of a few keepsakes that might
be worth a little bit of money that have been

375
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:48,036
brought out. "They just mainly took all of our
food stores. Most of my meats, most of my salted

376
00:27:48,036 --> 00:27:51,987
"meats, the dried meats, the fresh meats, the
butchered meats. They cleared out the butcher down

377
00:27:51,987 --> 00:27:53,100
"the street."

378
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:58,399
LAURA: Shrimp scampi. Butterfly shrimp.

379
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,055
TRAVIS: Coconut shrimp.

380
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:01,634
LAURA: Fried shrimp.

381
00:28:01,634 --> 00:28:04,000
SAM: Don't engage them.

382
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,412
TALIESIN: We're all going to die now.

383
00:28:09,412 --> 00:28:15,968
MATT: "That's a real curious-looking face you got
there."

384
00:28:15,968 --> 00:28:22,161
LIAM: Excuse me, I saw in the middle of the fray--
Sir. Excuse me.

385
00:28:22,161 --> 00:28:28,994
SAM: In Halfling, I say to him, I've also been a
victim of a horrible attack.

386
00:28:28,994 --> 00:28:34,356
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

387
00:28:34,356 --> 00:28:39,286
SAM: Oh, minus. Ten.

388
00:28:39,286 --> 00:28:45,169
MATT: But in Halfling, that helped. "Yeah, sorry.
What can I do?"

389
00:28:45,169 --> 00:28:51,792
LIAM: I'm sorry, I was part of the fray as well. I
was right in the thick of it. I saw a cart piled

390
00:28:51,792 --> 00:28:55,958
high with bodies. Are there people missing from
town?

391
00:28:55,958 --> 00:29:00,838
MATT: "Quite a few. You'd have to ask around some
of the crownsguard."

392
00:29:00,838 --> 00:29:05,707
LIAM: How has the rest of the village fared? Is
everything as poorly off as you are?

393
00:29:05,707 --> 00:29:11,778
MATT: "I mean, plenty of folks seem to get through
this okay. They only took down a few buildings.

394
00:29:11,778 --> 00:29:14,188
"I'm more worried about the folks that were plucked
from their homes."

395
00:29:14,188 --> 00:29:18,100
LIAM: Is yours the only business that was hit?

396
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:23,025
MATT: "I haven't looked around, to be perfectly
honest. I've been a little focused on--" and he

397
00:29:23,025 --> 00:29:25,741
gestures out with his hands at the rubble that was
once his life.

398
00:29:25,741 --> 00:29:27,671
TALIESIN: You had a lot of meat, didn't you?

399
00:29:27,671 --> 00:29:30,625
MATT: "Well, you have to present meat. A lot of
people around here eat meat."

400
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:34,812
TALIESIN: Would you say that you offer a larger
selection of meat than some of the other

401
00:29:34,812 --> 00:29:36,512
establishments in town?

402
00:29:36,512 --> 00:29:45,432
MATT: "If you're asking me, then the best meat.
Don't know about quantity, but quality was--" (tongue click)

403
00:29:45,432 --> 00:29:50,442
TALIESIN: I feel like I've been robbed of the
experience of your fine, fine meat products, and

404
00:29:50,442 --> 00:29:54,972
I, for one, would like you to rebuild so that I
might try some of your meats.

405
00:29:54,972 --> 00:30:05,204
MATT: "Well, if at some point the gracious gods
see fit to bequeath upon me a strike of good luck

406
00:30:05,204 --> 00:30:11,683
"and I can get to rebuilding, my friend, one day,
you may be able to try one of my meats."

407
00:30:11,683 --> 00:30:16,263
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a look-- Is the friend
who's dead skeletonized?

408
00:30:16,263 --> 00:30:17,731
MATT: Oh, yeah, burnt charred.

409
00:30:17,731 --> 00:30:21,000
TALIESIN: Oh, burnt, okay. Where is this butcher
that you mentioned as well?

410
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:27,084
MATT: "Oh that's--" He steps out through where the
doorframe is still standing, the one that you

411
00:30:27,084 --> 00:30:31,443
defended yourself through most of that battle,
just a free-standing frame now.

412
00:30:31,443 --> 00:30:36,280
MARISHA: Was I in the butcher's? Because that
would be some real horror-level shit.

413
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,506
TALIESIN: I think you were in the barbecue shack.

414
00:30:38,506 --> 00:30:40,067
MARISHA: That's kind of awesome.

415
00:30:40,067 --> 00:30:46,903
MATT: He points over to a building across the way,
which is one of the buildings that was nearby. He

416
00:30:46,903 --> 00:30:51,357
says, "That there's the Ruddy Top Butcher, well,
what remains of it," and you can see that building

417
00:30:51,357 --> 00:30:58,721
too. It's still standing, and it's nowhere near as
damaged as the Candleglow Inn, but it's sustained

418
00:30:58,721 --> 00:31:00,754
quite a bit of damage, and it looks like the roof
has fallen in.

419
00:31:00,754 --> 00:31:08,613
LIAM: I'm sorry, Mollymauk, another question for
you: Is there maybe-- I hope it is still

420
00:31:08,613 --> 00:31:10,483
standing-- but a supply store?

421
00:31:10,483 --> 00:31:16,697
MATT: "Yeah, if you're looking for farming
supplies, general supplies, there's--"

422
00:31:16,697 --> 00:31:19,819
LIAM: I'm sorry, I'm in the need of some incense.

423
00:31:19,819 --> 00:31:23,998
MATT: "Oh, you could probably find something like
that there, The Broad Barn."

424
00:31:23,998 --> 00:31:26,877
LAURA: Oh! It's a store!

425
00:31:26,877 --> 00:31:33,074
MARISHA: Question answered. I'm sorry, I'm
standing by Fjord. Question answered!

426
00:31:33,074 --> 00:31:37,028
TALIESIN: It's like half a question, because
you're wondering why it's called that at this point.

427
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:38,225
LAURA: I bet it's big.

428
00:31:38,225 --> 00:31:39,671
TALIESIN: At least wide.

429
00:31:39,671 --> 00:31:47,926
MATT: "At one time it was a barn, but the farm
stopped giving up crop, and so they converted the

430
00:31:47,926 --> 00:31:51,440
"barn itself into what was a general store, because
they started selling off the tools they didn't

431
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,741
"need, but that made them more money than the crops
did that year, so we started importing more tools,

432
00:31:55,741 --> 00:31:59,414
"and for the past 30 years the Broad Barn has been
our commonly known general supply place there on

433
00:31:59,414 --> 00:32:01,822
"the western side of Alfield, so if you want
to--"

434
00:32:01,822 --> 00:32:03,207
SAM: This is really fascinating.

435
00:32:03,207 --> 00:32:06,178
LAURA: Wow, this is a really good talk that we've
had.

436
00:32:06,178 --> 00:32:07,958
MATT: "Of course."

437
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:09,752
TRAVIS: Did you just out-talk Jester?

438
00:32:09,752 --> 00:32:16,696
LAURA: I think I'm going to go look for the Broad
Barn

439
00:32:16,696 --> 00:32:24,491
TALIESIN: That's an idea. Don't pack up shop just
yet, we're going to see if we can do something

440
00:32:24,491 --> 00:32:27,011
about these terrible creatures that have been
roaming around.

441
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:32,769
LAURA: Maybe we'll find all of those thousands of
gold for you, and you can build your shop back up.

442
00:32:32,769 --> 00:32:40,785
MATT: "Well, y'all look like you're geared up to
be making a mess. You going after these things?"

443
00:32:40,785 --> 00:32:43,152
TALIESIN: We are, perhaps, persons of action.

444
00:32:43,152 --> 00:32:47,718
LAURA: We're really tough. We have no fear.

445
00:32:47,718 --> 00:32:52,128
MATT: He leans in real close to you, getting on
his tippy toes to meet your gaze, and he says,

446
00:32:52,128 --> 00:32:59,962
"Well, if you manage to go and kill some of them
dog people, you tell them Thadeus Candleglow says hi."

447
00:32:59,962 --> 00:33:01,155
LAURA: I will.

448
00:33:01,155 --> 00:33:02,269
MATT: "Thank you."

449
00:33:02,269 --> 00:33:03,485
TALIESIN: She really will.

450
00:33:03,485 --> 00:33:04,261
MATT: "Good."

451
00:33:04,261 --> 00:33:12,663
LAURA: Here. It's a moldy donut. Be well,
child, the Traveler is with you.

452
00:33:12,663 --> 00:33:19,075
MATT: "I'm not a child, but I appreciate the
gesture."

453
00:33:19,075 --> 00:33:22,093
LAURA: You know my name! I leave.

454
00:33:22,093 --> 00:33:27,808
MATT: "Gesture. Her name's Gesture!"

455
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:30,413
TALIESIN: It is a gesture, like Prince.

456
00:33:30,413 --> 00:33:35,992
MATT: The adventurer formerly known as Jester. He
takes a bite, and (spitting).

457
00:33:35,992 --> 00:33:44,106
LIAM: Also, I'm sorry, just between you and me, I
know the look on your face a little bit, you seem

458
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:49,063
a little manic. If you have friends you can stay
with right now, you know you don't have to rebuild

459
00:33:49,063 --> 00:33:52,258
it today. I recommend you take it slow.

460
00:33:52,258 --> 00:33:58,750
MATT: "I don't think I have much of a choice at
the moment." He gives a long stare towards you

461
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:05,809
that fades past a little bit beyond. "Anyway, I
should get back to picking up the pieces. Excuse

462
00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:10,694
"me," and starts gathering more stuff from the
rubble, and the crownsguard behind goes over and

463
00:34:10,694 --> 00:34:16,087
takes the things he's already gathered, and begins
putting them into a small crate, and doesn't engage.

464
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:23,884
MARISHA: While they were having that conversation,
I'm hanging back with Fjord, if you're cool with that.

465
00:34:23,884 --> 00:34:25,466
TRAVIS: Yeah.

466
00:34:25,466 --> 00:34:46,583
MARISHA: Question: If you were a crazy, ravenous,
dog humanoid person thing, what would make you

467
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:51,710
really hungry all of a sudden? I didn't phrase
that question very well.

468
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:56,233
TRAVIS: No, I knew where you were going with it,
though. How do we ring the dinner bells, is what

469
00:34:56,233 --> 00:34:59,275
you're saying. How do we get them to come to us?

470
00:34:59,275 --> 00:35:08,239
MARISHA: Yeah. It seems like they're into meat?
Kind of anything.

471
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,062
TRAVIS: Well, they done took it all, I think.

472
00:35:11,062 --> 00:35:18,160
MARISHA: Also, they're really hungry, more so
now.

473
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,535
TRAVIS: Why more so now?

474
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,320
MARISHA: I don't know. Why more so now?

475
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,244
TRAVIS: Well, they took all the Luby's Cafeteria
with them, so I don't think they're going to be

476
00:35:27,244 --> 00:35:28,578
hungry for a bit.

477
00:35:28,578 --> 00:35:30,434
MARISHA: But what if they are still hungry?

478
00:35:30,434 --> 00:35:33,372
TRAVIS: Then we would need to roast some meats.

479
00:35:33,372 --> 00:35:36,818
MARISHA: You know who else was really hungry out
of fucking nowhere?

480
00:35:36,818 --> 00:35:38,609
TRAVIS: Who?

481
00:35:38,609 --> 00:35:46,301
MARISHA: Big angry toad man. Devil toad guy. I
feel like I should get better names for all these things.

482
00:35:46,301 --> 00:35:48,958
TRAVIS: Yeah. He was hungry all of a sudden?

483
00:35:48,958 --> 00:35:55,747
MARISHA: I don't know. I mean, it might be a
coincidence.

484
00:35:55,747 --> 00:36:02,621
TRAVIS: You thinking some of them gnolls had
some fiendish qualities, perhaps?

485
00:36:02,621 --> 00:36:04,852
MARISHA: Well, considering some of them were
undead.

486
00:36:04,852 --> 00:36:06,425
TRAVIS: Right, shit.

487
00:36:06,425 --> 00:36:08,283
MARISHA: There was that whole zombie gnoll thing.

488
00:36:08,283 --> 00:36:09,736
TRAVIS: I forgot all about that.

489
00:36:09,736 --> 00:36:12,698
MARISHA: Yeah. How could you forget that?

490
00:36:12,698 --> 00:36:18,207
TRAVIS: I have some weird dreams. What did you have
in mind? Other nights.

491
00:36:18,207 --> 00:36:19,590
MARISHA and TRAVIS: What?

492
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:23,718
(laughter)

493
00:36:23,718 --> 00:36:28,943
MARISHA: I legitimately didn't understand what you
said.

494
00:36:28,943 --> 00:36:30,693
TRAVIS: Oh, nothing, I got shit in my teeth.

495
00:36:30,693 --> 00:36:32,088
MARISHA: Are you okay?

496
00:36:32,088 --> 00:36:35,339
TRAVIS: Yeah, fine. Did you have a plan? Did you
want to do something to wrangle them--

497
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:37,323
MARISHA: I was just striking conversation.

498
00:36:37,323 --> 00:36:42,264
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry. Well, maybe we'll follow them
to the Barn Broad.

499
00:36:42,264 --> 00:36:44,528
MARISHA: Okay, let's go to the Barn Broad.

500
00:36:44,528 --> 00:36:47,422
TRAVIS: Broad Barn. I was fucking with you.

501
00:36:47,422 --> 00:36:50,561
MARISHA: I was going along with you.

502
00:36:50,561 --> 00:36:52,749
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's all right.

503
00:36:52,749 --> 00:36:57,042
TALIESIN: When did we hire Tom Stoppard to write
this?

504
00:36:57,042 --> 00:36:58,665
MATT: I know. Seriously.

505
00:36:58,665 --> 00:37:01,568
TALIESIN: I couldn't deal.

506
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:04,003
MATT: Where are you guys off to?

507
00:37:04,003 --> 00:37:06,585
LIAM: To the Broad Barn.

508
00:37:06,585 --> 00:37:15,199
MATT: You were told it was on the western edge of
town, and since most of the city is built on two

509
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:22,668
intersections of main road, you follow the core
essential east to west path, and on the way out,

510
00:37:22,668 --> 00:37:26,624
where you first entered last night, even though
you just ran past it, you can see there is indeed,

511
00:37:26,624 --> 00:37:32,176
right on the edge of town, almost like the town
was built to fill the gap in between, a very large

512
00:37:32,176 --> 00:37:43,207
barn that looks to have hundreds and hundreds of
feet of coiled rope on the outside. The front doors are

513
00:37:43,207 --> 00:37:49,697
wide open and you can see a number of folks are
coming in and out, many of them with cleaning

514
00:37:49,697 --> 00:37:58,612
supplies, heavy pieces of cloth, buckets, whatever
can be used to start getting rid of the remaining

515
00:37:58,612 --> 00:38:06,500
black splash and ashy covering of last night's
destruction. You also notice, as you approach on

516
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:14,681
the outside, there's a bit of commotion. You see a
dozen or so crownsguard, and a handful of armed

517
00:38:14,681 --> 00:38:19,384
volunteers, that all appear to be in regular civvy
farmer clothing, that are all gathered in a loose

518
00:38:19,384 --> 00:38:26,788
huddle, with Bryce among them. You hear a loud
grating voice from within that huddle. As you

519
00:38:26,788 --> 00:38:33,980
approach from the outskirts, you see a middle-aged
male gnome of ruddy complexion and slicked parted

520
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:40,037
dark hair. He wears very clean maroon and gold
robes, and that would lend an air of elegance,

521
00:38:40,037 --> 00:38:45,756
were he not hopping around and pointing fingers.
You see as he starts shouting between the crew,

522
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:55,246
waving his hand around, "Without any warning, it
was your job, Bryce! With Ruben cold dead, that

523
00:38:55,246 --> 00:39:01,294
"leaves no Lawmaster to preside, forcing me to take
that position as well. I do not need that added

524
00:39:01,294 --> 00:39:09,588
"responsibility, but until we get a new Lawmaster
instated from Rexxentrum, I have no choice." Bryce

525
00:39:09,588 --> 00:39:16,514
pipes up at this point, glancing over and seeing
you guys' presence, "Starosta, I've sent a request

526
00:39:16,514 --> 00:39:23,701
"to both Zadash and Bladegarden for a supplementary
force, but it may be weeks before any would

527
00:39:23,701 --> 00:39:31,044
"arrive. Can we send trained hands at my approval
to retaliate?" At which point, the Starosta, which

528
00:39:31,044 --> 00:39:36,466
has now been identified, says, "We cannot spare any of
our forces while the surviving guard are drawn so

529
00:39:36,466 --> 00:39:43,734
"thin. Out of the question! Maintain a vigilant
perimeter and deflect any further incursions."

530
00:39:43,734 --> 00:39:50,462
Bryce nods slowly. "Can we at least have
permission to hire mercenary strength to

531
00:39:50,462 --> 00:39:56,819
"retaliate, then? I feel not being proactive before
the gnoll force can fully regroup would put us at a

532
00:39:56,819 --> 00:40:05,468
"severe disadvant--" At which point is cut off by
the Starosta. "Yes, that's fine! Hire outside! I

533
00:40:05,468 --> 00:40:11,099
"don't want any more of my citizens' deaths on my
record. Dismissed!"

534
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:16,197
He immediately pushes through the
crownsguard and storms off, which is hilarious to

535
00:40:16,197 --> 00:40:22,310
watch a gnome storm out of a group of people, and
off with a huff is escorted by three crownsguard

536
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:29,921
from behind, out of that space. The crowd begins
to murmur and disperse, and go about their

537
00:40:29,921 --> 00:40:37,604
business. Bryce turns and smiles at all of you.
They've washed up from last night's damage and

538
00:40:37,604 --> 00:40:40,830
dirty conflict, so as they approach--

539
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:46,384
MARISHA: I turn to Jester, and I go, look
inviting. Look heroic.

540
00:40:46,384 --> 00:40:57,678
MATT: "I'm deeply sorry about that. Starosta Kosh
is high-strung on a holiday, and tensions have

541
00:40:57,678 --> 00:41:04,120
"never been this high since he was assigned here
eight years ago, so please don't take that to

542
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,166
"heart. He's just a--"

543
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:08,445
LAURA: Dick.

544
00:41:08,445 --> 00:41:10,164
MATT: "Your words, not mine."

545
00:41:10,164 --> 00:41:15,782
TRAVIS: Seems some people handle pressure better
than others. He doesn't seem like the handling type.

546
00:41:15,782 --> 00:41:24,600
MATT: "No. Those in higher political positions
rarely do, it seems. Anyway, I want to thank you

547
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:31,326
"all again for your aid last night. I can't fathom
the further death toll, had you not been there and

548
00:41:31,326 --> 00:41:42,158
"jumped in selflessly as you did. Thank you." Bryce
trails off and looks back towards where Starosta

549
00:41:42,158 --> 00:41:50,149
Kosh had stormed off and goes, "Fucking Dwendalian
political bullshit. We've needed a more trained

550
00:41:50,149 --> 00:41:57,284
"guard here for weeks, especially with Xhorhas
bleeding into the valley, but we're far too south

551
00:41:57,284 --> 00:42:04,503
"to matter. Any request has been declined due to
all necessary forces being needed at the garrisons

552
00:42:04,503 --> 00:42:09,249
"by Brokenveil. If they were doing their jobs at
the Bluffs, we wouldn't have so many reports of

553
00:42:09,249 --> 00:42:15,300
"violent beasts in the valley in the first place,
but here we are. At least I've gotten approval for

554
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:24,766
"a bit more cash. To that, while I do not know what
your business here is in Alfield, if you are still

555
00:42:24,766 --> 00:42:28,292
"interested, we are in need of some skilled
mercenary work."

556
00:42:28,292 --> 00:42:30,339
LAURA: We're going to kill all of them!

557
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:37,395
TRAVIS: We couldn't help but overhear that you
were asking for some aid. How long were you

558
00:42:37,395 --> 00:42:39,894
thinking you might need these replacements?

559
00:42:39,894 --> 00:42:47,866
MATT: "Well, until at least this threat has been
dealt with in a satisfactory way. I've

560
00:42:47,866 --> 00:42:53,942
"unfortunately not had my scouts return after
they were sent the night before, which does not

561
00:42:53,942 --> 00:43:06,183
"bode well, but I suspect that we should see some
sort of hopeful backup sent by Zadash or

562
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:11,967
"Bladegarden within the next week or two. In the meantime,
we're a bit of a sitting duck scenario, so I've

563
00:43:11,967 --> 00:43:16,775
"sent a few guards to go to Zadash to see what
other mercenaries could be sent forward. We do

564
00:43:16,775 --> 00:43:20,775
"have some folks traveling along the road and will
keep an eye out to see if anybody else is looking

565
00:43:20,775 --> 00:43:26,449
"for some coin, but for now, you are our first line
of defense. Or offense, if you will."

566
00:43:26,449 --> 00:43:32,381
TRAVIS: Well, I think I speak for all of us, we're
certainly up to the task for a bit. Well, maybe

567
00:43:32,381 --> 00:43:40,070
for a little less than a bit. Can I ask, are there
any other threats to this town, besides those gnolls?

568
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:47,438
MATT: "Oh, there are plenty of threats. Let's see,
famine, syphilis--"

569
00:43:47,438 --> 00:43:51,756
TRAVIS: Things that come on legs and with weapons,
I mean.

570
00:43:51,756 --> 00:43:54,887
LAURA: Syphilis can come with legs--

571
00:43:54,887 --> 00:43:56,343
TALIESIN: I feel like that was worth pointing
out.

572
00:43:56,343 --> 00:43:58,504
TRAVIS: Why do both of you know that?

573
00:43:58,504 --> 00:44:00,321
MATT: "You're not wrong."

574
00:44:00,321 --> 00:44:01,489
TALIESIN: Tiefling thing.

575
00:44:01,489 --> 00:44:12,175
MATT: "This backwards place has its fair share of
issues, as I've come to learn as being not from

576
00:44:12,175 --> 00:44:22,221
"the region, but it seems to me that nothing on
this scale has quite assaulted in some time. I

things and creatures wandering past the Xhorhas

been around. It's the whole reason that the

the guard can keep things at bay. This is a very

00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:45,416
"organized thing, I don't like it. I don't like it
at all."

581
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:48,485
TALIESIN: It's new, then?

582
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:51,139
MATT: "Well, this is new. Nothing on this scale."

583
00:44:51,139 --> 00:44:55,758
TALIESIN: It seems, from what we've seen, that
they were hungry.

584
00:44:55,758 --> 00:44:59,981
MATT: "I've done a bit of research overnight, and
it seems that gnolls are known to be very

585
00:44:59,981 --> 00:45:11,650
"aggressively hungry creatures. Could say famished
to the point of obsession."

586
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:13,587
LAURA: I feel their pain.

587
00:45:13,587 --> 00:45:15,281
TALIESIN: I can understand that.

588
00:45:15,281 --> 00:45:25,140
LIAM: So you wish to hire us. How much? We are
very experienced, but we'd like to know what we're

589
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:28,600
talking about in advance. What kind of money are
we talking about?

590
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:41,245
MATT: "The deal stands. 30 gold per gnoll ear,
proof of a dead gnoll. If you can recover any of

591
00:45:41,245 --> 00:45:46,690
"the missing townsfolk here in Alfield and bring
them back safely, I'd be willing to pay 25 gold a

"head, returned."

593
00:45:48,302 --> 00:45:50,725
SAM: What if we find a dead body and bring it
back?

594
00:45:50,725 --> 00:45:52,792
LIAM: Is there some lesser number for those?

595
00:45:52,792 --> 00:46:00,348
MATT: "There is, because even if they are gone, we
would wish to bury those we've lost. I could

596
00:46:00,348 --> 00:46:08,751
"probably muster ten gold per retrieved member of
the Alfield citizenry."

597
00:46:08,751 --> 00:46:11,183
LAURA: Specifically their heads, too?

598
00:46:11,183 --> 00:46:16,503
MATT: "Preferably all of them. Whatever you can
find."

599
00:46:16,503 --> 00:46:19,891
LIAM: It is permissible, is what they're saying
here.

600
00:46:19,891 --> 00:46:24,665
MATT: "Seeing what these creatures did last night,
I don't know what state you'll find any of

601
00:46:24,665 --> 00:46:28,121
"them, but I'm being hopeful."

602
00:46:28,121 --> 00:46:30,587
TRAVIS: Do you know what area they might have gone
to?

603
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:35,854
MATT: "They seemed to be heading east, to a
northeast direction. That's where the scouts went

604
00:46:35,854 --> 00:46:41,233
"before they left. I wish I had more information
for you, but that may be the place to start."

605
00:46:41,233 --> 00:46:45,066
LIAM: Could you tell us at least what the
landscape is like in that direction, what is over there?

606
00:46:45,066 --> 00:46:52,183
MATT: "There are some spotty woods on the
outskirts of the town that Alfield was built

607
00:46:52,183 --> 00:47:03,443
"into. Beyond that, it's rolling hills and fields.
There are some older, long grown-over settlements

608
00:47:03,443 --> 00:47:11,106
"that have been abandoned. Small-scale, but
honestly, beyond here it's mainly fields."

609
00:47:11,106 --> 00:47:14,411
LAURA: I bet we can find some ghosts.

610
00:47:14,411 --> 00:47:15,908
TALIESIN: I always love a ruin.

611
00:47:15,908 --> 00:47:21,355
MATT: "If I might offer some advice: If you do see
a ghost, don't engage."

612
00:47:21,355 --> 00:47:26,279
LAURA: Do you know where they are? So we know how
to steer clear?

613
00:47:26,279 --> 00:47:32,243
MATT: "My dear, there are ghosts everywhere in
this world. It's far more ancient than you assume."

614
00:47:32,243 --> 00:47:35,204
LAURA: Ooh!

615
00:47:35,204 --> 00:47:45,120
MARISHA: Bryce, some of these gnolls were undead,
or raised from the dead. Do you have any inkling

616
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,862
as to why, or have you seen that problem around
here before?

617
00:47:47,862 --> 00:47:55,588
MATT: "I don't know as to why, but it's not
uncommon, from what I could ascertain. Whatever

618
00:47:55,588 --> 00:48:07,074
"dark powers they worship, it seems, allows some to
progress beyond death. Rumors are that when gnolls

619
00:48:07,074 --> 00:48:14,815
"go hungry and left to feed on each other, what
remains rises to fight alongside those that still live."

620
00:48:14,815 --> 00:48:18,871
LAURA: That would be why some of them have chunks
missing out of them.

621
00:48:18,871 --> 00:48:26,209
LIAM: This comes from research you have done, that
you have read up on? Would you be able to share

622
00:48:26,209 --> 00:48:29,419
this reading with me, so that we are fully
prepared?

623
00:48:29,419 --> 00:48:34,158
MATT: "Honestly, I just shared with you most of
all that I had learned."

624
00:48:34,158 --> 00:48:35,808
LIAM: Just a small book.

625
00:48:35,808 --> 00:48:39,203
TRAVIS: More of a pamphlet, actually.

626
00:48:39,203 --> 00:48:52,154
MATT: "The only other bit of information I was
able to pull from that was, they have this thing,

627
00:48:52,154 --> 00:49:01,585
"this entity that they worship. It has a name."
Pulls out a few small notes.

628
00:49:01,585 --> 00:49:03,256
LAURA: Fire hydrant.

629
00:49:03,256 --> 00:49:11,104
SAM: Does it start with an A? Sometimes if you go
down through the alphabet, A, B--

630
00:49:11,104 --> 00:49:16,614
MATT: As you're saying this, they pull a small
series of notes from their pocket. "Yeenoghu."

631
00:49:16,614 --> 00:49:21,184
SAM: With a Y? That would have taken forever.

632
00:49:21,184 --> 00:49:27,425
MATT: Let that be a lesson, young halfling.

633
00:49:27,425 --> 00:49:30,514
LIAM: With a Y? Yeenogru?

634
00:49:30,514 --> 00:49:32,258
ALL: Yeenoghu.

635
00:49:32,258 --> 00:49:38,982
MATT: "I don't know how to pronounce it, I only
read it. I apologize."

636
00:49:38,982 --> 00:49:40,880
TALIESIN: Do I know anything about Yeenoghu?

637
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,873
MATT: Make a religion check. With advantage.

638
00:49:45,873 --> 00:49:52,448
TALIESIN: A religion check? 18.

639
00:49:52,448 --> 00:50:03,979
MATT: It sparks a memory in you. Information
floods your mind, and you recall hearing about

640
00:50:03,979 --> 00:50:16,434
various demonic leaders of the Abyss. Creatures
that once walked the prime plane. You see images

641
00:50:16,434 --> 00:50:27,431
of this large, bestial, feral, angry demon.
Ever-hungering, ever wandering to conquer and

642
00:50:27,431 --> 00:50:36,477
devour in its wake, leaving destruction, fetid
meat, and waves of yipping, angry hyenas to devour

643
00:50:36,477 --> 00:50:38,217
what was left behind.

644
00:50:38,217 --> 00:50:41,347
TALIESIN: Thank you.

645
00:50:41,347 --> 00:50:49,961
LIAM: Sorry, another question. May I call you
Bryce?

646
00:50:49,961 --> 00:50:51,350
MATT: "Of course."

647
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:57,088
LIAM: Bryce. We were just about to go inside the
barn here and get outfitted for this-- for many

648
00:50:57,088 --> 00:51:03,148
things, but especially now that we are going to go
take care of this problem. Do you have any sort of

649
00:51:03,148 --> 00:51:08,503
pull with these people? Might we get any
friendly--

650
00:51:08,503 --> 00:51:09,597
TRAVIS: Advance?

651
00:51:09,597 --> 00:51:14,360
LIAM: No. Well, sure, but I'm talking about some
sort of discount for getting ready for the road.

652
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,934
We're not that flush.

653
00:51:16,934 --> 00:51:24,667
MATT: "It's not so much about that, more than
these aren't well-to-do people in their own right,

654
00:51:24,667 --> 00:51:28,305
"and right now, honestly, rebuilding--"

655
00:51:28,305 --> 00:51:31,737
LIAM: It's asking a bit much, I was too forward.

656
00:51:31,737 --> 00:51:39,972
MATT: "That's all right. But you, as I know quite
well from personal experience, have some coin to

657
00:51:39,972 --> 00:51:43,049
"your name. Perhaps that will be of aid to you."

658
00:51:43,049 --> 00:51:44,286
LIAM: Yes.

659
00:51:44,286 --> 00:51:50,109
TALIESIN: One last quick question, though. What do
the gnolls normally eat?

660
00:51:50,109 --> 00:51:56,341
MATT: "As far as I could tell, whatever living
things they can get their hands on."

661
00:51:56,341 --> 00:51:59,607
TALIESIN: Those buffalo creatures that we see
roaming around?

662
00:51:59,607 --> 00:52:00,863
MATT: "Probably."

663
00:52:00,863 --> 00:52:03,368
TALIESIN: Good to know.

664
00:52:03,368 --> 00:52:17,633
MATT: "I will say, if there are any surviving
captives, then haste is very much key. For if they

665
00:52:17,633 --> 00:52:23,738
"are as hungry as they seem, regardless of the
massive volume they have acquired through the

666
00:52:23,738 --> 00:52:29,120
"evening, I know not how many their number is, or
how hungry they are. Take too long, there may not

667
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,894
"be much left to find."

668
00:52:30,894 --> 00:52:33,106
LAURA: We'll get this stuff and head right out.

669
00:52:33,106 --> 00:52:38,153
LIAM: Sorry, my curiosity gets the best of me,
always. You are talking about buff-- "buffaro"

670
00:52:38,153 --> 00:52:44,332
creatures, or something? We saw these beasts on
the outskirts of town. They look brown-furred,

671
00:52:44,332 --> 00:52:47,295
beast of burden-type creature? Do you know what
those animals are?

672
00:52:47,295 --> 00:52:50,375
MATT: "Right, yes. The valley aurochs."

673
00:52:50,375 --> 00:53:04,954
LIAM: Valley aurochs? Got it, thank you. All
right, we should get ready for the road. Walking

674
00:53:04,954 --> 00:53:06,321
into the store.

675
00:53:06,321 --> 00:53:09,304
LAURA: Was it hit at all? Was the store that we're
going into destroyed at all?

676
00:53:09,304 --> 00:53:14,528
MATT: No, this was far enough west. It was mainly
just a few buildings in the eastern side. Coming

677
00:53:14,528 --> 00:53:19,779
from where the woods were, it seemed like they
were using cover of tree and canopy upon the

678
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:23,717
incursion, then immediately assaulted partway into
the eastern part of the city, burned it from the

679
00:53:23,717 --> 00:53:30,419
middle, and then used the flames to escape out the
back. What were you about to say?

680
00:53:30,419 --> 00:53:31,814
MARISHA: (gasps) Bryce?

681
00:53:31,814 --> 00:53:35,648
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (exaggerated coughing)

682
00:53:35,648 --> 00:53:37,797
MATT: "Yes? Are you all right?"

683
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:46,050
MARISHA: Sorry, a lot on my mind. Speaking of the
aurochs, I asked you yesterday if you'd heard if any of the

684
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:51,547
farmers had had their cattle hit? You heard that
yet?

685
00:53:51,547 --> 00:53:53,971
MATT: "I could ask around. It does happen on
occasion."

686
00:53:53,971 --> 00:53:58,769
MARISHA: It's fine. We'll ask on our way out. It's
good.

687
00:53:58,769 --> 00:54:01,241
TRAVIS: Hey, Caleb?

688
00:54:01,241 --> 00:54:02,262
LIAM: Yeah?

689
00:54:02,262 --> 00:54:12,258
MATT: "If you'll excuse me, I do have something to
get to. But good luck and godspeed."

690
00:54:12,258 --> 00:54:14,536
LAURA: Have fun dealing with the dick.

691
00:54:14,536 --> 00:54:18,475
MATT: "I'll do my best." Bryce turns around and
leaves.

692
00:54:18,475 --> 00:54:26,504
LAURA: Did I recognize Starosta Kosh? Did he seem
like the type that would have made a little side

693
00:54:26,504 --> 00:54:31,899
trip down to-- because he seems like the type.

694
00:54:31,899 --> 00:54:38,161
TRAVIS: Was that a character-DM inside joke?

695
00:54:38,161 --> 00:54:40,359
MARISHA: I know; I feel like I learned something.

696
00:54:40,359 --> 00:54:41,973
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

697
00:54:41,973 --> 00:54:44,503
TALIESIN: I'm filing, I'm putting a wall
between that.

698
00:54:44,503 --> 00:54:49,221
SAM: I can't read your dice at all.

699
00:54:49,221 --> 00:54:51,708
LAURA: Intelligence, 18.

700
00:54:51,708 --> 00:55:04,023
MATT: The robe coloring is what caught you, and
the hair. The specific slicked and parted comb.

701
00:55:04,023 --> 00:55:13,569
You have seen this individual before. You were
younger. Maybe eight or so years ago. Eight or

702
00:55:13,569 --> 00:55:14,683
nine years.

703
00:55:14,683 --> 00:55:16,004
LAURA: Good to know.

704
00:55:16,004 --> 00:55:21,070
TALIESIN: You're just made of secrets, aren't you?
Just made of secrets.

705
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:22,289
TRAVIS: Caleb.

706
00:55:22,289 --> 00:55:23,023
LIAM: Yeah?

707
00:55:23,023 --> 00:55:27,606
TRAVIS: In my personal holdings-- I don't really
remember putting this there-- but apparently I

708
00:55:27,606 --> 00:55:32,538
have five sticks of incense that I have no
intention of using.

709
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:33,565
LIAM: Oh yeah?

710
00:55:33,565 --> 00:55:35,015
TRAVIS: Will that do you any good?

711
00:55:35,015 --> 00:55:37,473
LIAM: Well, that would be worth about-- how much,
DM?

712
00:55:37,473 --> 00:55:39,620
MATT: What does this incense come from?

713
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:42,718
TRAVIS: I think it was part of a thing. I don't
know.

714
00:55:42,718 --> 00:55:44,230
LIAM: A pack or something?

715
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:45,808
TRAVIS: It's D&amp;D Beyond. I don't know.

716
00:55:45,808 --> 00:55:49,001
MATT: Oh, so it's part of an adventuring pack,
then.

717
00:55:49,001 --> 00:55:50,642
TRAVIS: I think so, yes.

718
00:55:50,642 --> 00:55:58,044
MATT: It would be negligible by comparison. I'd
say maybe, at most, five silver's worth. At most.

719
00:55:58,044 --> 00:56:00,532
LIAM: That is really very--

720
00:56:00,532 --> 00:56:04,461
TRAVIS: Changed your day, didn't it? Everything's
coming up flowers now.

721
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:07,106
LIAM: Yes, this has helped me immeasurably.

722
00:56:07,106 --> 00:56:08,578
TRAVIS: Don't mention it.

723
00:56:08,578 --> 00:56:11,207
LAURA: Wait, wait. How much incense do you need?

724
00:56:11,207 --> 00:56:21,488
LIAM: Well, it depends on how much I want to do
with it. I want my cat back. But I was in the

725
00:56:21,488 --> 00:56:24,751
realm of 15 or 20 gold I'm going to spend here
today, if they have that much.

726
00:56:24,751 --> 00:56:28,231
LAURA: On incense?! And that five sticks was five
silver's worth?

727
00:56:28,231 --> 00:56:30,771
LIAM: Did anyone say that out loud?

728
00:56:30,771 --> 00:56:36,045
SAM: She has a good eye for value.

729
00:56:36,045 --> 00:56:40,110
LAURA: That is a lot of incense to burn.

730
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:42,743
MATT: Well, there's a lot of parts to--

731
00:56:42,743 --> 00:56:51,167
LIAM: It's not quantity. It is the quality of
the incense. And this was top-shelf, but I still

732
00:56:51,167 --> 00:57:00,573
need more. So, in we go. And then I say: Thank
you, big guy. And I punch him and I walk in.

733
00:57:00,573 --> 00:57:02,849
TRAVIS: As he walks away, I'm like: Ow!

734
00:57:02,849 --> 00:57:05,636
(laughter)

735
00:57:05,636 --> 00:57:07,891
MATT: I think both of you do that, as you both
separate.

736
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:13,110
LIAM: Keep up a good face for two seconds.

737
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:20,014
MATT: As you walk into Broad Barn, there are five
other individuals that are coming through and

738
00:57:20,014 --> 00:57:36,459
picking up thick cloth for cleaning. One person is
picking up a few different burn balm kits. On the

739
00:57:36,459 --> 00:57:47,513
far end, as they're checking out, there is an
extremely old gentleman with this giant, gnarled

740
00:57:47,513 --> 00:57:55,545
tuft of a chin beard that merges with this halo,
like a lion's mane of white hair. He has this

741
00:57:55,545 --> 00:58:03,719
really thin, long, crooked nose. Almost like
Engywook from NeverEnding Story, but no glasses.

742
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:12,273
He's trying to keep a smile in the rather dark
faces of the people that are coming in, with the

743
00:58:12,273 --> 00:58:20,343
evening's events coming around. As you guys walk
in and approach, he glances down and goes, "Well.

744
00:58:20,343 --> 00:58:23,815
"If y'all need something, y'all just let me know."

745
00:58:23,815 --> 00:58:26,814
SAM: Oh boy. West Virginia.

746
00:58:26,814 --> 00:58:29,506
LAURA: Do you have any pickles?

747
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,897
MATT: "Y'all want pickles?"

748
00:58:31,897 --> 00:58:35,758
LAURA: You seem like the type of place that would
carry pickles.

749
00:58:35,758 --> 00:58:41,958
MATT: He leans back and rummages through what
sounds like a small paper bag.

750
00:58:41,958 --> 00:58:46,073
LAURA: They come in barrels, usually. You get
barrels of pickles.

751
00:58:46,073 --> 00:58:51,937
MATT: There's a small glass mason jar with two
pickles and he goes, "I'm willing to part with

752
00:58:51,937 --> 00:58:53,530
"these here pickles!"

753
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:58,264
LAURA: Is it poop in a jar? Or is it pickles?

754
00:58:58,264 --> 00:59:01,444
MATT: No, it's pickles. It looks like he may have
just pulled it out of his lunch.

755
00:59:01,444 --> 00:59:03,389
TRAVIS: Only you would put poop in a jar, Jester.

756
00:59:03,389 --> 00:59:04,785
LAURA: That's true.

757
00:59:04,785 --> 00:59:10,544
MATT: "I could part with them for around three
copper?"

758
00:59:10,544 --> 00:59:16,239
LAURA: That is a good deal, sir, and I will give
you the copper.

759
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:20,488
TALIESIN: Do you need more copper? Are you all
right?

760
00:59:20,488 --> 00:59:26,128
LAURA: No, hold on. No, I've got copper around
somewhere.

761
00:59:26,128 --> 00:59:28,713
TALIESIN: Okay, because I'll give you two copper
if I get one of those pickles.

762
00:59:28,713 --> 00:59:33,402
LAURA: Okay! Here, I pick some lint off one of the
coppers that I have.

763
00:59:33,402 --> 00:59:34,983
MATT: He takes the copper from you.

764
00:59:34,983 --> 00:59:36,210
TALIESIN: I pass him the two copper.

765
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:41,944
MATT: He takes the copper from you. Slides forward
the pickles and goes, (laughs) "Good deal!"

766
00:59:42,001 --> 00:59:44,862
LIAM: Excuse me. I just inhaled my own spit.

767
00:59:44,862 --> 00:59:50,054
MATT: "Don't do that! That is not conducive to a
lengthy lifetime."

768
00:59:50,054 --> 00:59:58,619
LIAM: (Speak N Spell voice) I am okay. (as Caleb)
I am needing a very fine kind of incense, and I

769
00:59:58,619 --> 01:00:02,720
don't know if that is the type of thing this
establishment would carry, but it's very

770
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,817
important. Do you have that sort of thing?

771
01:00:04,817 --> 01:00:10,112
MATT: "You want incense? That's fancy."

772
01:00:10,112 --> 01:00:14,023
LIAM: I'm sorry, it's very noisy in the shop. What
did you say?

773
01:00:14,023 --> 01:00:17,688
MATT: "It's really fancy, them incense."

774
01:00:17,688 --> 01:00:21,595
LIAM: Well, look at me. Can you not tell how fancy
I am?

775
01:00:21,595 --> 01:00:23,323
MATT: "That's why I'm curious."

776
01:00:23,323 --> 01:00:30,876
LIAM: Well. You know, I've been on the road a long
time and I'm carrying a smell with me, if you

777
01:00:30,876 --> 01:00:32,379
cannot tell.

778
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:34,019
MATT: "I got incense!"

779
01:00:34,019 --> 01:00:43,426
LIAM: To the point, I like it. I would like to
spend about 20 gold worth of incense. Do you have

780
01:00:43,426 --> 01:00:45,911
that much? I don't mean cheap shit.

781
01:00:45,911 --> 01:00:50,920
MATT: "What kind of establishment do you take me
for?"

782
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:53,676
LIAM: Well, it's a barn, <i>ja</i>?

783
01:00:53,676 --> 01:01:05,710
MATT: "Touché." He wanders away from there and
gathers any semblance of anything that could be

784
01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:12,865
considered incense to some degree. It's a massive
volume, it's-- when he said quality over quantity,

785
01:01:12,865 --> 01:01:22,493
this is definitely a quantity circumstance. Two big
burlap sacks filled with all sorts of fine ground

786
01:01:22,493 --> 01:01:26,626
herbs and things that could amount to--

787
01:01:26,626 --> 01:01:29,489
LIAM: I would like to make an insight check to
make sure it's not oregano.

788
01:01:29,489 --> 01:01:31,732
MATT: Go for it.

789
01:01:31,732 --> 01:01:39,369
LIAM: Come on, where's the druid? That's what
would be for oregano. That's Vex. This one.

790
01:01:39,369 --> 01:01:42,085
LAURA: But she would know if you were swindling.

791
01:01:42,085 --> 01:01:43,328
LIAM: Perception?

792
01:01:43,328 --> 01:01:44,745
MATT: No, that'll be insight.

793
01:01:44,745 --> 01:01:47,335
LIAM: Insight? Oh, that's much better. That is an
<i>elf</i>.

794
01:01:47,335 --> 01:01:49,861
TRAVIS and LAURA: A what?

795
01:01:49,861 --> 01:01:50,936
MATT: An elf.

796
01:01:50,936 --> 01:01:55,671
LIAM: <i>Elf.</i> 11. You just learned something,
everybody. It's 11 in German.

797
01:01:55,671 --> 01:02:00,922
MATT: He seems to be doing the best he can.

798
01:02:00,922 --> 01:02:09,061
LIAM: Good. This is really good. I will give you
17 gold for all this.

799
01:02:09,061 --> 01:02:11,185
MATT: "Deal!"

800
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:17,917
LIAM: One. Two. (continues counting)

801
01:02:17,917 --> 01:02:21,931
SAM: While he's counting this out, is there anyone
else in the store? Anyone at all?

802
01:02:21,931 --> 01:02:26,131
MATT: At this point, there's three other people in
the store, and they're slowly filtering out.

803
01:02:26,131 --> 01:02:34,018
SAM: Do I see any little trinkets or anything?
Little brass things? Little baby bottles? Anything?

804
01:02:34,018 --> 01:02:43,657
MATT: It seems that most everything they have
here-- a lot of them are basic farming supplies.

805
01:02:43,657 --> 01:02:53,380
There are a few metallic joints that could be used
for when you're tapping a keg. They have some keg

806
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:56,883
taps there. They have-- oh my god.

807
01:02:56,883 --> 01:02:58,964
LAURA: You're such a dick.

808
01:02:58,964 --> 01:03:00,706
LIAM: 16.

809
01:03:00,706 --> 01:03:02,345
SAM: Oh, that one fell.

810
01:03:02,345 --> 01:03:08,796
LIAM: 16. And I push the 16 gold forward.

811
01:03:08,796 --> 01:03:13,069
MATT: (slamming) "I appreciate your patronage."

812
01:03:13,069 --> 01:03:18,266
LIAM: These are heavy.

813
01:03:18,266 --> 01:03:22,779
TALIESIN: I know this may be a stretch, but do you
have maybe any healing potions or anything like

814
01:03:22,779 --> 01:03:27,714
that? Or maybe-- this might be weird-- some kind
of poisons maybe?

815
01:03:27,714 --> 01:03:35,164
MATT: "That's pretty weird. I'm going to say
there, sir, I mean you look pretty weird. That's a

816
01:03:35,164 --> 01:03:38,166
"pretty weird request. No, we do not carry
poisons."

817
01:03:38,166 --> 01:03:41,258
TALIESIN: For dealing with pests on a farm. That
sort of thing.

818
01:03:41,258 --> 01:03:47,022
MATT: "We have insecticides."

819
01:03:47,022 --> 01:03:50,662
TALIESIN: Think that will work on a gnoll?

820
01:03:50,662 --> 01:03:55,023
TRAVIS: Yeah! Insecticide. Pesticide. Herbicide.

821
01:03:55,023 --> 01:04:03,839
MARISHA: An insecticide generally refers to
insects. And we're talking gnolls.

822
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,297
LAURA: But it's usually poison you put--

823
01:04:05,297 --> 01:04:07,841
TRAVIS: Yeah, but you ever chugged a bunch of
insecticide? That's a bad day.

824
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:10,191
TALIESIN: Stuff is stuff, it's bad for anybody. I
guess.

825
01:04:10,191 --> 01:04:14,580
LIAM: Is it flammable? Do I know if it's
flammable?

826
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:17,688
MARISHA and TALIESIN: How much is it?

827
01:04:17,688 --> 01:04:22,023
MATT: "For about a vial that big? A silver."

828
01:04:22,023 --> 01:04:25,660
MARISHA: You're going to have to use a lot.

829
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:29,870
TALIESIN: What would that really-- If I were to
drink that right now, what do you think that would

830
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:31,864
do to me?

831
01:04:31,923 --> 01:04:34,972
MATT: "Probably have some real serious shits
for a few days."

832
01:04:35,046 --> 01:04:37,069
TRAVIS: It's like Visine.

833
01:04:37,069 --> 01:04:40,196
TALIESIN: Wow, really?

834
01:04:40,196 --> 01:04:43,795
SAM: May I examine it?

835
01:04:43,795 --> 01:04:44,855
MATT: Yeah.

836
01:04:44,855 --> 01:04:48,884
SAM: Okay. I'm going to look at it. Smell it. Look
at the fluid. Do I know anything about this

837
01:04:48,884 --> 01:04:50,280
chemical at all?

838
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:58,227
MATT: You do. It's a very diluted form of acute
poison, to the point where it wouldn't actually

839
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:06,856
affect any larger creature. But if put in a large
batch of water used to spray down crops, certain

840
01:05:06,856 --> 01:05:14,534
insects-- what are they called again? I forget--
aphids, things like that would die off.

841
01:05:14,534 --> 01:05:18,117
SAM: Aphids? Oh, that's nothing. It won't really
do much.

842
01:05:18,117 --> 01:05:21,786
TALIESIN: Do you know about these sorts of
things?

843
01:05:21,786 --> 01:05:23,478
SAM: Sometimes. Not a lot.

844
01:05:23,478 --> 01:05:25,223
TALIESIN: That's very impressive.

845
01:05:25,223 --> 01:05:26,895
LIAM: Nott, you're selling yourself short.

846
01:05:26,895 --> 01:05:33,007
SAM: Speaking of-- and I'll ask him for the
components to make acid. Does he have that stuff?

847
01:05:33,007 --> 01:05:43,626
MATT: Yeah. In a very Anarchist Cookbook kind of
way. He doesn't sell you acid, but there are the

848
01:05:43,626 --> 01:05:46,515
materials available where you could create it.

849
01:05:46,515 --> 01:05:49,663
SAM: Okay. How much for all this shit?

850
01:05:49,663 --> 01:05:51,982
(laughter)

851
01:05:51,982 --> 01:05:55,163
MATT: How many vials' worth are you looking for?

852
01:05:55,163 --> 01:05:56,136
SAM: Just one.

853
01:05:56,136 --> 01:05:59,215
MATT: Just one? "This will run you about 12
gold."

854
01:05:59,215 --> 01:06:03,287
SAM: All right. That's fine.

855
01:06:03,287 --> 01:06:06,691
LAURA: Oh, can you throw a med kit in there
with it, if you have any left?

856
01:06:06,756 --> 01:06:14,345
MATT: He looks around. "I'm afraid we're clear
out. Bit of a-- "

857
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:16,426
LAURA: You have things going on.

858
01:06:16,426 --> 01:06:17,988
MATT: "Lot of things. Sorry."

859
01:06:17,988 --> 01:06:19,000
LAURA: It's fine.

860
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,773
MATT: "My apologies."

861
01:06:20,773 --> 01:06:22,844
LAURA: No, it's okay. I have this pickle.

862
01:06:22,844 --> 01:06:25,014
MATT: "It's a good pickle."

863
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:26,853
TALIESIN: It was.

864
01:06:26,853 --> 01:06:29,355
MARISHA: Is it a good pickle, though?

865
01:06:29,355 --> 01:06:32,783
LAURA: I haven't tried it. I just drank the juice,
but he ate it.

866
01:06:32,783 --> 01:06:35,043
TALIESIN: I ate mine. It was quite good. Now we're
just sharing the juice at this point.

867
01:06:35,043 --> 01:06:36,736
MARISHA: Guys, let's go kill gnolls.

868
01:06:36,736 --> 01:06:38,165
TRAVIS: Just the juice?

869
01:06:38,165 --> 01:06:39,275
TALIESIN: Juice is great!

870
01:06:39,275 --> 01:06:40,360
TRAVIS: It is. With a little whiskey.

871
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,003
MATT: (groans)

872
01:06:42,003 --> 01:06:43,397
MARISHA and LAURA: Picklebacks!

873
01:06:43,397 --> 01:06:46,559
MATT: Brine drinkers.

874
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:50,085
MARISHA: Nom nom nom!

875
01:06:50,085 --> 01:06:52,366
TRAVIS: Like cheeseburger in a shot glass.

876
01:06:52,366 --> 01:06:53,611
MARISHA: Yeah, so good!

877
01:06:53,611 --> 01:06:54,626
MATT: Ugh, stop it.

878
01:06:54,626 --> 01:06:59,785
LAURA: Are we prepared now to go?

879
01:06:59,785 --> 01:07:00,710
SAM: Wait, no.

880
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:01,905
LIAM: No, I have things to do.

881
01:07:01,905 --> 01:07:05,563
SAM: Do you sell any healing potions?

882
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:07,079
TALIESIN: I asked that.

883
01:07:07,079 --> 01:07:09,244
SAM: You asked that already?

884
01:07:09,244 --> 01:07:10,255
TALIESIN: Yeah, I did ask that.

885
01:07:10,255 --> 01:07:11,189
SAM: Oh. Never mind!

886
01:07:11,189 --> 01:07:14,844
MATT: "We're not really purveyors of healing
potions, and those that have are usually held by

887
01:07:14,844 --> 01:07:16,080
"the Crownsguard."

888
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:18,157
TALIESIN: Wait, the Crownsguard? Really?

889
01:07:18,157 --> 01:07:21,031
LAURA: We didn't ask Bryce for any healing
potions.

890
01:07:21,031 --> 01:07:22,615
TALIESIN: We should ask Bryce for some healing
potions.

891
01:07:22,615 --> 01:07:27,385
MATT: You actually asked the night before, and
Bryce had said that they're currently being used

892
01:07:27,385 --> 01:07:35,586
to tend to the people that were in really bad
places. It's hard to walk through a war zone and

893
01:07:35,586 --> 01:07:37,277
be like, "Hey guys! Do you have supplies?"

894
01:07:37,277 --> 01:07:39,571
TRAVIS: What do you need to do for the rest of the
day, Caleb?

895
01:07:39,571 --> 01:07:44,747
LIAM: Well, I would really like to get my cat
back, so I would need about an hour to go do a

896
01:07:44,747 --> 01:07:47,474
little stuff. Do you have anything else to do?

897
01:07:47,474 --> 01:07:52,048
LAURA: I mean, there are people getting chopped up
and eaten. But if you really want a cat.

898
01:07:52,048 --> 01:07:57,473
LIAM: What are we doing? Are we taking our cart?

899
01:07:57,473 --> 01:08:00,788
TALIESIN: Take the cart? And get some meat from
the butcher?

900
01:08:00,788 --> 01:08:03,033
LAURA: We might be able to go faster.

901
01:08:03,033 --> 01:08:06,193
TRAVIS: I think if we were a little spread it
would help.

902
01:08:06,193 --> 01:08:10,262
LIAM: Well, okay. Maybe I can put it on hold,
although I really hate to. But let's come up with

903
01:08:10,262 --> 01:08:12,436
what are we doing? What is the plan?

904
01:08:12,436 --> 01:08:17,500
TRAVIS: Well, I would follow the direction they
left last night. See if we can find a trail.

905
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:20,745
SAM: We're just going to go into the belly of the
beast? Because one of them shot me and killed me

906
01:08:20,745 --> 01:08:24,542
with an arrow. We could draw them out.

907
01:08:24,542 --> 01:08:26,428
TRAVIS: Yeah, you just stay behind Caleb. You'll
be fine.

908
01:08:26,428 --> 01:08:27,769
LAURA: You didn't die, Nott. I saved you.

909
01:08:27,769 --> 01:08:33,517
SAM: Thank you so much, but I don't want to be in
that predicament again! Can we draw them out somehow?

910
01:08:33,517 --> 01:08:35,013
TRAVIS: Yeah.

911
01:08:35,013 --> 01:08:45,568
SAM: They are fond of meat. Here's my idea. We
stage a barbecue contest. Finest in the land! All

912
01:08:45,568 --> 01:08:53,268
the best barbecue will be there! And then, when
they come to sample our wares, I run and you kill them.

913
01:08:53,268 --> 01:09:02,223
TRAVIS: You know, I love that idea. Small thing,
though. <i>Time</i>, again, is of the essence.

914
01:09:02,223 --> 01:09:06,818
SAM: Because you want to slow cook that stuff to
be really good. It's true.

915
01:09:06,818 --> 01:09:11,142
TRAVIS: Right. Dry aged. Really get a good hickory
chip under them. Problem is, people might be dying

916
01:09:11,142 --> 01:09:14,579
in the meantime. So if we could find a more
expedient solution?

917
01:09:14,579 --> 01:09:18,570
LIAM: Oh, so were you thinking of having a
barbecue here or setting up a barbecue on the road?

918
01:09:18,570 --> 01:09:20,620
LAURA: I'm think in the middle of a field, yes. So
that it's--

919
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:21,834
LIAM: Just a random field?

920
01:09:21,834 --> 01:09:22,762
LAURA: Yeah.

921
01:09:22,762 --> 01:09:24,244
TALIESIN: It'll take a while to make the signage
alone.

922
01:09:24,244 --> 01:09:25,657
LAURA: So it seems like less of a trap.

923
01:09:25,657 --> 01:09:27,835
TRAVIS: Beau had an idea! Get them, Beau! You tell
her--

924
01:09:27,835 --> 01:09:29,465
MARISHA: No, you take it for her, please.

925
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:33,997
TRAVIS: Beau had a fantastic observation. If we
happen to see one of those beasts of burden on

926
01:09:33,997 --> 01:09:39,100
our way out tracking, maybe we could wrangle one
up and use it as a bait.

927
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:45,235
LAURA: And if we don't see one, then Fjord, you're
the biggest.

928
01:09:45,235 --> 01:09:47,284
TALIESIN: That's fair.

929
01:09:47,284 --> 01:09:49,566
LIAM: Either way, we will probably need the
cart.

930
01:09:49,566 --> 01:09:52,177
TALIESIN: We could also see what they still have
at the butcher's.

931
01:09:52,177 --> 01:09:53,470
TRAVIS: To bring people back.

932
01:09:53,470 --> 01:09:54,408
LAURA: And bring people back!

933
01:09:54,408 --> 01:09:55,676
SAM: And maybe one extra horse.

934
01:09:55,676 --> 01:09:56,914
MARISHA: What did you say, Molly?

935
01:09:56,914 --> 01:10:00,679
TALIESIN: Or we could see what else they still
have at the butcher's. There's a butcher.

936
01:10:00,679 --> 01:10:03,371
MARISHA: Well, the butcher got severely cleaned
out.

937
01:10:03,371 --> 01:10:04,908
TALIESIN: Well, we just heard that, he might--

938
01:10:04,908 --> 01:10:08,843
TRAVIS: I think you're right. Extra horse. We need
the cart.

939
01:10:08,843 --> 01:10:12,290
LIAM: To carry one of those beasts if we kill
one.

940
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:18,720
MARISHA: If we can try and figure out a way to
set up our operation on the edge of the forest so

941
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:21,919
that we're not in the middle of a field, in the
open--

942
01:10:21,919 --> 01:10:25,703
LIAM: Well, is the point to try to-- I'm sorry, no,
you finish your thought.

943
01:10:25,703 --> 01:10:35,338
MARISHA: Hills are bad to fight in, unless you're
on top of the hill. That's good.

944
01:10:35,338 --> 01:10:37,695
LIAM: I'm not a tactician, but I have a question.

945
01:10:37,695 --> 01:10:38,961
MARISHA: Go ahead.

946
01:10:38,961 --> 01:10:45,044
LIAM: Are we trying to go back to these things where they
live? Their lair, their home, their camp? Or are

947
01:10:45,044 --> 01:10:47,302
we hoping to luck into them on the road or--?

948
01:10:47,302 --> 01:10:52,124
TRAVIS: I think we'd be making a best guess at this
point. My best hope is to find out where they are.

949
01:10:52,195 --> 01:10:57,008
What it looks like where they're staying, and if
we can, without confrontation, get some survivors

950
01:10:57,008 --> 01:10:58,830
out of there. That would be ideal.

951
01:10:58,830 --> 01:11:00,368
LIAM: I like that idea as well.

952
01:11:00,368 --> 01:11:06,002
MARISHA: Actually, that's not a bad idea at all.
Maybe we could have like a survivor round up team

953
01:11:06,002 --> 01:11:07,360
and a defense team?

954
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:10,578
LAURA: But then how do we get all of the ears?

955
01:11:10,578 --> 01:11:16,733
TRAVIS: I'm just putting it out there: maybe
survivors before ears.

956
01:11:16,733 --> 01:11:21,655
MARISHA: We can always go back out and get more
ears whenever we damn feel like it.

957
01:11:21,655 --> 01:11:28,519
LIAM: Well, that's the thing. We can do both, but
there is a timestamp on the people. We should take

958
01:11:28,519 --> 01:11:33,439
care of the people first. Because then we're
increasing how much gold we will bring in because

959
01:11:33,439 --> 01:11:37,477
if they die then we will not get as much money for
them if they are alive. We should get them alive.

960
01:11:37,477 --> 01:11:43,326
Get them out. Kill the baddies if we can at the
same time, and if not, go back a second time.

961
01:11:43,326 --> 01:11:46,847
TRAVIS: I thought you said you weren't a
tactician, look at you!

962
01:11:46,847 --> 01:11:48,650
SAM: He's very smart.

963
01:11:48,650 --> 01:11:50,541
TALIESIN: Extremely tactile.

964
01:11:50,541 --> 01:11:52,028
TRAVIS: Caleb's plan! Let's do it!

965
01:11:52,028 --> 01:11:53,644
LIAM: No social graces. Let's do this.

966
01:11:53,644 --> 01:11:54,668
MARISHA: Let's go!

967
01:11:54,668 --> 01:11:57,193
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Break!

968
01:11:57,193 --> 01:11:59,218
SAM: Are we getting another horse?

969
01:11:59,218 --> 01:12:03,189
LAURA: We're going to ask Bryce if they have a
horse to spare.

970
01:12:03,189 --> 01:12:08,174
SAM: Why don't you four go get horses? Me and the
C-man will go get some incense and stuff.

971
01:12:08,174 --> 01:12:13,635
TRAVIS: C-man? I thought I was the seaman? Fucking
get your titles right. Come on, brother, you know

972
01:12:13,635 --> 01:12:16,744
you want to! I'm a proud son of a bitch!

973
01:12:16,744 --> 01:12:18,468
SAM: Sorry! You're a seaman.

974
01:12:18,468 --> 01:12:20,333
LIAM: Wait, so now we need time?

975
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:23,074
TALIESIN: We're going to go get a horse, you don't
need to be here for that.

976
01:12:23,074 --> 01:12:25,200
LIAM: Oh god. I really want my cat, but maybe--

977
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,693
SAM: Let's go get some incense! I need to buy some
tarts.

978
01:12:27,693 --> 01:12:30,629
LIAM: We'll get the tarts. Maybe it would be
handier as a bird.

979
01:12:30,629 --> 01:12:31,832
LAURA: You need a tart?

980
01:12:31,832 --> 01:12:32,782
SAM: I need a tart.

981
01:12:32,782 --> 01:12:36,657
LAURA: Oh, well, why didn't you say something?
Hold on, let me dig.

982
01:12:36,657 --> 01:12:40,155
SAM: That's a bag of pastries!

983
01:12:40,155 --> 01:12:41,445
LAURA: There's this one--

984
01:12:41,445 --> 01:12:42,484
SAM: Wow!

985
01:12:42,484 --> 01:12:45,521
LAURA: Hold on. I think there's a blackberry one
somewhere in here.

986
01:12:45,521 --> 01:12:47,703
SAM: Ooh, I can't tell what this used to be.

987
01:12:47,703 --> 01:12:50,737
LAURA: It's kind of gross; I'm sorry.

988
01:12:50,737 --> 01:12:53,878
SAM: Is that the top or the bottom?

989
01:12:53,878 --> 01:12:58,334
LAURA: I can't tell anymore. It's all black.
Sorry!

990
01:12:58,334 --> 01:12:59,977
SAM: I have two tarts!

991
01:12:59,977 --> 01:13:01,855
MATT: Yes. Very stale.

992
01:13:01,855 --> 01:13:03,500
SAM: I'm taking them.

993
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:08,900
MATT: You can't tell if the sour smell is
intentional flavor or just time taking its toll.

994
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:11,746
It'll be tart one way or the other.

995
01:13:11,746 --> 01:13:15,835
TRAVIS: Do we see any crownsguard around? In the
street.

996
01:13:15,835 --> 01:13:21,113
MATT: Over time you will. They're scattered a bit
thin and a lot of them are currently focused on

997
01:13:21,113 --> 01:13:25,861
either perimeter watch, in case they come back, or
helping out those that need help inside the city.

998
01:13:25,861 --> 01:13:29,302
TRAVIS: I'd just like to find one, if I could.

999
01:13:29,302 --> 01:13:33,385
MATT: Within ten minutes of wandering through the
city as you guys have gathered yourselves and

1000
01:13:33,385 --> 01:13:39,323
begun heading towards the eastern side, you see a
crownsguard who is currently walking by with some

1001
01:13:39,323 --> 01:13:45,896
washrags under one arm and a little streak of
dried blood down the side of their face. Looks to

1002
01:13:45,896 --> 01:13:52,398
be a young man probably in his mid-20s or so.
Longish hair that's been heavily braided on the

1003
01:13:52,398 --> 01:13:56,529
sides and then pinned to the back in a tuft of a
ponytail.

1004
01:13:56,529 --> 01:13:57,584
TRAVIS: Howdy!

1005
01:13:57,584 --> 01:13:59,332
MATT: "Yes?"

1006
01:13:59,332 --> 01:14:03,337
TRAVIS: Sorry to bother, but we've been
commissioned by Bryce to make a little expedition

1007
01:14:03,337 --> 01:14:07,982
to go after those gnolls and we're going to need
an extra steed if the Crownsguard has one.

1008
01:14:07,982 --> 01:14:14,597
MATT: "We're not allowed to give out any
Crownsguard supplies. If you're looking for a

1009
01:14:14,597 --> 01:14:19,448
"steed, you'd probably have to go to the On the Wind
Stables. They're going to be your best bet."

1010
01:14:19,448 --> 01:14:21,168
TRAVIS: Where would those be?

1011
01:14:21,168 --> 01:14:28,824
MATT: "Right--" and points over towards the
northern side of the town. It's one of the

1012
01:14:28,824 --> 01:14:30,509
buildings that's taken a little bit of fire
damage.

1013
01:14:30,509 --> 01:14:35,304
TRAVIS: Are you concerned about the people that
live in this town? Clock's ticking on their lives

1014
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:39,028
and you want me to go get a steed from another
stable instead of saving their lives?

1015
01:14:39,028 --> 01:14:41,716
MATT: "It's not--"

1016
01:14:41,716 --> 01:14:46,206
TRAVIS: I sure would hate to have to report this
to Bryce. I think they'd be pretty upset about it.

1017
01:14:46,206 --> 01:14:54,130
MATT: Make a deception check.

1018
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:57,054
TRAVIS: 13.

1019
01:14:57,054 --> 01:15:06,921
MATT: "Look, I mean no offense whatsoever and if--
I can go find Bryce and see if we-- the

1020
01:15:06,921 --> 01:15:09,393
"Watchmaster would be much more suited to--"

1021
01:15:09,393 --> 01:15:10,383
TRAVIS: Your name?

1022
01:15:10,383 --> 01:15:13,141
MATT: "Reggie."

1023
01:15:13,141 --> 01:15:24,067
TRAVIS: Reggie. I'm disappointed, Reggie. I don't
know what else to say. Let's go.

1024
01:15:24,067 --> 01:15:26,106
(laughter)

1025
01:15:26,106 --> 01:15:30,327
LAURA: Should we go to the stables then?

1026
01:15:30,327 --> 01:15:31,876
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah. Now!

1027
01:15:31,876 --> 01:15:38,619
LIAM: Reggie, this town has been hit hard, you
look very weary and maybe a little down on your

1028
01:15:38,619 --> 01:15:44,968
luck yourself. Maybe I'm just reading into things,
but I would gladly pay you a silver for this horse.

1029
01:15:44,968 --> 01:15:52,167
TALIESIN: Let me tell you, Reggie, it would be the
best deal you could possibly make. I'm going to

1030
01:15:52,167 --> 01:15:54,033
use Charm Person.

1031
01:15:54,033 --> 01:16:10,893
MATT: Did not make that DC check. Reggie glances
over at you. He goes, "Let me see what I can do,"

1032
01:16:10,893 --> 01:16:18,402
and quickly makes his way northward to the outside
of the stables.

1033
01:16:18,402 --> 01:16:19,680
TRAVIS: Very nice!

1034
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:21,465
TALIESIN: Thank you!

1035
01:16:21,465 --> 01:16:27,713
MATT: About five minutes pass and you can hear the
clopping of hooves as Reggie comes back with a

1036
01:16:27,713 --> 01:16:35,317
very obstinate beast on the reins. Dragging it
towards you, slowly guiding it. Reggie doesn't

1037
01:16:35,317 --> 01:16:41,293
seem to be a very trained individual when it comes
to handling creatures, especially beasts of

1038
01:16:41,293 --> 01:16:44,268
burden. "Will this do?"

1039
01:16:44,268 --> 01:16:48,190
MARISHA: Oh good, I see you brought us your best,
Reggie. Thanks, man.

1040
01:16:48,190 --> 01:16:53,799
TALIESIN: Ignore her, she's very difficult.

1041
01:16:53,799 --> 01:16:55,208
MATT: Hands you the reins.

1042
01:16:55,208 --> 01:16:58,418
TALIESIN: You're a hero. Thank you.

1043
01:16:58,418 --> 01:17:02,125
MATT: "Best I could do. Good luck."

1044
01:17:02,125 --> 01:17:03,634
LIAM: Here's that copper. Thank you.

1045
01:17:03,634 --> 01:17:05,294
MATT: "Thank you."

1046
01:17:05,294 --> 01:17:07,241
TALIESIN: I hand him a silver also.

1047
01:17:07,241 --> 01:17:10,457
MATT: "Thank you. Thank you."

1048
01:17:10,457 --> 01:17:12,143
LIAM: Silver's way too little for a horse.

1049
01:17:12,143 --> 01:17:14,362
TALIESIN: You said silver and we're being fair!

1050
01:17:14,362 --> 01:17:19,414
MATT: "Just bring it back-- it's on loan! It's on
loan."

1051
01:17:19,414 --> 01:17:21,578
TALIESIN: If we come back, it comes back.

1052
01:17:21,578 --> 01:17:28,538
LAURA: Probably. We definitely won't use it as
bait for the gnolls. Okay, bye!

1053
01:17:28,538 --> 01:17:33,734
TRAVIS: We make our way over to where we left our
other horse and cart.

1054
01:17:33,734 --> 01:17:39,584
MATT: Okay, easy enough to find. You placed it at
a hitching post with a little bit of feed over the

1055
01:17:39,584 --> 01:17:44,159
evening. Your cart and horse are safe and at your
disposal.

1056
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:49,883
MARISHA: I saw them take off into the forest. I
tracked a little bit right between those trees. I

1057
01:17:49,883 --> 01:17:52,084
don't know, we can start there.

1058
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:59,355
LAURA: I bet they left a lot of tracks and
probably some cart things.

1059
01:17:59,355 --> 01:18:02,242
TRAVIS: I don't know why, I thought you were going
to say they left behind poop.

1060
01:18:02,242 --> 01:18:08,176
LAURA: They probably did! Oh my god! They weren't
wearing any underwear, were they?

1061
01:18:08,176 --> 01:18:16,486
MATT: They were wearing cobbled-together or
scavenged bits of leather and hide armors.

1062
01:18:16,486 --> 01:18:19,738
LAURA: But did it have holes for their butts?

1063
01:18:19,738 --> 01:18:26,397
MATT: It seemed like most of them would have had
some means of disposing of their excrement.

1064
01:18:26,397 --> 01:18:30,640
LIAM: They don't care, they're swinging low and
leaving it behind.

1065
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,545
MATT: They weren't very well-dressed.

1066
01:18:32,545 --> 01:18:37,390
TRAVIS: If that's the direction you saw them head
off in, check it out.

1067
01:18:37,390 --> 01:18:41,491
MARISHA: I'll be on the lookout for cart tracks.

1068
01:18:41,491 --> 01:18:50,446
LIAM: As we go, and also, we didn't have time, so
here, off you go. I will sit in the cart and go blind.

1069
01:18:50,446 --> 01:18:57,269
MATT: Okay. While you are sending Frumpkin to
keep a watch, you are keeping an eye out

1070
01:18:57,334 --> 01:18:59,857
for tracks. Make a survival check, please.

1071
01:18:59,857 --> 01:19:04,206
MARISHA: It's not my strongest, but it's okay.

1072
01:19:04,206 --> 01:19:07,636
LAURA: I'm keeping an eye out for poop.

1073
01:19:07,636 --> 01:19:19,275
MARISHA: 16. No wait! I rolled a natural 16, so
19! I thought it was a 13; I apologize.

1074
01:19:19,275 --> 01:19:30,217
MATT: Very quickly you come upon a number of gnoll
footprints in the ground. Seem to be multiple cart

1075
01:19:30,217 --> 01:19:33,160
tracks. That was the one that you saw.

1076
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:35,226
LAURA: (gasps) Oh no!

1077
01:19:35,226 --> 01:19:39,630
MARISHA: Wait, are there nearby towns? Are there
other nearby villages?

1078
01:19:39,630 --> 01:19:41,206
MATT: There were multiple carts.

1079
01:19:41,206 --> 01:19:44,278
MARISHA: Oh, we only saw one.

1080
01:19:44,278 --> 01:19:45,319
LIAM: The last one.

1081
01:19:45,319 --> 01:19:51,291
MARISHA: Okay, can I get like an odd estimate of
maybe how many gnolls we might be dealing with

1082
01:19:51,291 --> 01:19:53,139
based on the amount of tracks?

1083
01:19:53,139 --> 01:20:01,303
MATT: With that roll, I'd say you surmise
somewhere in the neighborhood of about 18 or so

1084
01:20:01,303 --> 01:20:06,578
gnolls. From what you can gather on the tracks
that you found.

1085
01:20:06,578 --> 01:20:11,184
TALIESIN: Would my Hunter's Bane be useful for
that? For tracking these creatures?

1086
01:20:11,184 --> 01:20:14,990
MATT: You can attempt to glean information.

1087
01:20:14,990 --> 01:20:17,209
TALIESIN: Since they technically have some undead
around them?

1088
01:20:17,209 --> 01:20:24,435
MATT: For the specific-- sure. Go ahead and make a
survival check to see if you can even find those tracks.

1089
01:20:24,435 --> 01:20:30,438
TALIESIN: Just a standard one? Standard survival
check. All right.

1090
01:20:30,438 --> 01:20:33,175
MATT: Well, technically you're tracking undead, so
you get advantage on this one.

1091
01:20:33,175 --> 01:20:35,407
TALIESIN: 17.

1092
01:20:35,407 --> 01:20:43,359
MATT: Same degree. You find the tracks, you see
there is the remnants of this gnoll horde

1093
01:20:43,359 --> 01:20:49,514
returning towards a similar direction. You find
three sets of cart tracks.

1094
01:20:49,514 --> 01:20:57,344
MARISHA: I turn to the rest of the group and I go:
Good news, we're real stupid if we thought we

1095
01:20:57,344 --> 01:21:03,947
couldn't track them, because there's a fuckton of
them. That'll be easy. Bad news is, oh god,

1096
01:21:04,010 --> 01:21:07,223
there's a fuckton of them. That's it.

1097
01:21:07,223 --> 01:21:13,305
TRAVIS: Yeah, that is bad news. Are the carts all
heading in the same direction or would they split up?

1098
01:21:13,305 --> 01:21:21,177
MATT: They all converge into one path. They head
through the relatively thin woods that surround

1099
01:21:21,177 --> 01:21:28,587
the northeastern side of Alfield. As you progress
on that path out to the other side of the woods,

1100
01:21:28,587 --> 01:21:39,677
continue into the northeastern fields where the
rolling hills begin, these hills seem to go on for miles.

1101
01:21:39,677 --> 01:21:45,109
LIAM: Frumpkin would be in the air 300-400 feet in
front of the cart and I wouldn't do 100% of the

1102
01:21:45,109 --> 01:21:49,600
time, but I would talk for three minutes and then maybe
go: hold on one sec (magic sound effect) and then

1103
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,627
come back. So intermittent.

1104
01:21:51,627 --> 01:21:53,323
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.

1105
01:21:53,323 --> 01:21:56,234
TRAVIS: Tall grass on these rolling hills?

1106
01:21:56,234 --> 01:21:58,766
MARISHA: Or is it just open fucking hills?

1107
01:21:58,766 --> 01:22:00,170
TRAVIS: Picked by beasts or--

1108
01:22:00,170 --> 01:22:01,909
MATT: No, no. It's tall grass across the hills--

1109
01:22:01,909 --> 01:22:06,605
LIAM: Seven.

1110
01:22:06,605 --> 01:22:18,833
MATT: The grass can vary anywhere from knee-high
to chest-high in places. The hills towards the

1111
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:24,160
top can get a little more rocky. There are patches
where the grass doesn't grow as well and there's

1112
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:36,324
open dirt and broken shale. After about an hour or
so of tracking in that direction, you come upon the

1113
01:22:36,324 --> 01:22:48,447
Rillway Road, which is the main road that heads up
towards Felderwin. You can see it a little ways off.

1114
01:22:48,447 --> 01:22:57,230
LIAM: Also, in this time I would have told the
rest of the group: Before Nott and I arrived in

1115
01:22:57,230 --> 01:23:04,656
Trostenwald, just outside the city limits, we were
waylaid by gnolls previously and they were hiding

1116
01:23:04,656 --> 01:23:09,718
in grass just like this. It was very much like
this so we should be-- I'm getting very nervous

1117
01:23:09,718 --> 01:23:11,578
right now looking at it all.

1118
01:23:11,578 --> 01:23:17,207
TALIESIN: In theory, am I actively tracking these
creatures? The undead at least.

1119
01:23:17,207 --> 01:23:24,569
MATT: The undead tracks are falling in line with
her tracking. They're moving as a group, but there

1120
01:23:24,569 --> 01:23:29,249
are far less undead tracks than there are regular
gnolls, so as best you can to keep tabs on it.

1121
01:23:29,249 --> 01:23:32,359
TALIESIN: I'm curious how much of this Hunter's
Bane I can actually be using right now.

1122
01:23:32,359 --> 01:23:36,964
MATT: You'd be leading if she hadn't made an
equally good roll, so now both of you are leading this.

1123
01:23:36,964 --> 01:23:40,804
TRAVIS: The grass, is it dead or vibrant
green?

1124
01:23:40,804 --> 01:23:51,009
MATT: Vibrant green, for the most part. The wind
is picking up a little bit and you can see,

1125
01:23:51,009 --> 01:23:55,821
especially when you start coming up over some of
the bigger hills, you can see the waves cresting over

1126
01:23:55,821 --> 01:24:02,311
the hillside and causing the shift of it. It's a
very beautiful space.

1127
01:24:02,311 --> 01:24:05,128
TRAVIS: Is it still the morning hour or about
midday?

1128
01:24:05,128 --> 01:24:09,617
MATT: At this point now, you've been travelling,
we'll say an hour and a half. It's getting close

1129
01:24:09,617 --> 01:24:11,506
to noon.

1130
01:24:11,506 --> 01:24:13,493
TRAVIS: High noon?

1131
01:24:13,493 --> 01:24:14,642
MATT: Yes.

1132
01:24:14,642 --> 01:24:19,930
LIAM: You know, I know it's actually about 11:37,
so we're not quite there yet. By the position of

1133
01:24:19,996 --> 01:24:21,142
the sun.

1134
01:24:21,142 --> 01:24:24,045
TRAVIS: Oh no! Don't do it! Oh no!

1135
01:24:24,045 --> 01:24:27,939
(nervous laughter)

1136
01:24:27,939 --> 01:24:29,747
TALIESIN: He's sorry!

1137
01:24:29,747 --> 01:24:31,087
TRAVIS: It was right there!

1138
01:24:31,087 --> 01:24:36,164
MATT: I know. Anyway.

1139
01:24:36,164 --> 01:24:38,418
LIAM: Beholder!

1140
01:24:38,418 --> 01:24:41,136
MATT: Don't think I'm not tempted.

1141
01:24:41,136 --> 01:24:52,070
MARISHA: How rough and how open is our situation
right now? Are we in the middle of an open field?

1142
01:24:52,070 --> 01:24:55,601
MATT: You're pretty much in the middle of an open
field. But the tracks you can see-- Because you

1143
01:24:55,601 --> 01:25:00,691
can see the Rillway Road south of you and the
tracks begin to shift further north. As they were

1144
01:25:00,691 --> 01:25:04,927
heading back, they were keeping off the road best
they can as well. You also do notice that within

1145
01:25:04,927 --> 01:25:10,640
the tracks you do find bits of grass that are
spattered with drying blood. You don't know how

1146
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:16,510
fresh it is. Go ahead and make a perception
check.

1147
01:25:16,510 --> 01:25:20,487
MARISHA: Remember how I was like, this is the
worst situation to be in?

1148
01:25:20,487 --> 01:25:21,746
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

1149
01:25:21,746 --> 01:25:23,434
MARISHA: I feel like this might be the worst
situation to be in.

1150
01:25:23,434 --> 01:25:24,437
TRAVIS: Right.

1151
01:25:24,437 --> 01:25:25,282
MARISHA: Survival?

1152
01:25:25,282 --> 01:25:26,235
MATT: Perception.

1153
01:25:26,235 --> 01:25:31,068
MARISHA: Perception? Oh no. Did you see that?

1154
01:25:31,068 --> 01:25:32,336
LAURA: It's a one?

1155
01:25:32,336 --> 01:25:33,742
MARISHA: One.

1156
01:25:33,742 --> 01:25:39,533
MATT: As you're having this conversation with
Fjord, you're just not paying attention to the

1157
01:25:39,533 --> 01:25:40,691
road in front of you.

1158
01:25:40,691 --> 01:25:41,782
MARISHA: God.

1159
01:25:41,782 --> 01:25:46,453
LAURA: If we're sitting in the cart, is the grass
taller than us or is it way lower than us?

1160
01:25:46,453 --> 01:25:51,560
MATT: No, it's about as tall as the cart at times,
at times it's lower. You guys do stand out amongst

1161
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:56,318
the grass. As you head over the hills, or down
below, you are above the grass line without an issue.

1162
01:25:56,318 --> 01:25:59,270
LIAM: Walking on the ground as a human, is it up
to here, or--

1163
01:25:59,270 --> 01:26:02,694
MATT: Yeah, it's about up to your chest at times.
Waist to chest. It varies.

1164
01:26:02,694 --> 01:26:07,882
LAURA: If I stand up in the cart as we go, can I
see out into the grass?

1165
01:26:07,882 --> 01:26:10,758
MATT: Yeah, if you wanted.

1166
01:26:10,758 --> 01:26:15,874
MARISHA: What if I gave Jester a ride on my
shoulders? While we walked.

1167
01:26:15,874 --> 01:26:17,811
SAM: On a moving cart?

1168
01:26:17,811 --> 01:26:19,517
MATT: What could possibly go wrong?

1169
01:26:19,517 --> 01:26:21,194
LIAM: You've seen Teen Wolf, ja?

1170
01:26:21,194 --> 01:26:24,593
MARISHA: In the cart, and I'm holding you. It'd be
kind of cool!

1171
01:26:24,593 --> 01:26:27,573
MATT: I'll allow it. Go ahead and make a
perception check, Jester.

1172
01:26:27,573 --> 01:26:31,381
LIAM: Here goes all Jester's teeth.

1173
01:26:31,381 --> 01:26:33,761
LAURA: 19!

1174
01:26:33,761 --> 01:26:35,394
MATT: Make a strength check.

1175
01:26:35,394 --> 01:26:39,011
MARISHA: Okay. Like a saving throw or just a
check?

1176
01:26:39,011 --> 01:26:41,138
MATT: Just a check.

1177
01:26:41,138 --> 01:26:44,807
LIAM: Come on, roll a 20. Make it happen.

1178
01:26:44,807 --> 01:26:47,284
MARISHA: That's okay. It's a 14.

1179
01:26:47,284 --> 01:26:56,242
MATT: Right as your eyes catch something, you drop
for a second, but Beau's beneath you (groans) just

1180
01:26:56,242 --> 01:27:02,669
barely holding you, the elbows start to buckle a
bit, but rallies and (groans) holds you up above.

1181
01:27:02,669 --> 01:27:05,760
You flatten your back out and give a graceful pose
as you look ahead.

1182
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:08,743
LAURA: I'm flying! I'm flying, Jack!

1183
01:27:08,743 --> 01:27:10,292
MARISHA: (strained) Yeah, you are!

1184
01:27:10,292 --> 01:27:12,699
TRAVIS: King of the world!

1185
01:27:12,699 --> 01:27:16,910
MATT: As you guys are coming up over a hill, you
get a good view down, and you can see between the

1186
01:27:16,910 --> 01:27:24,144
tall grass and the high weeds that are beginning
to cluster this vicinity, there is a series of

1187
01:27:24,144 --> 01:27:29,594
large hills that all break down into this valley
where the grass just ends in this area. It looks

1188
01:27:29,594 --> 01:27:39,384
like it's barren rock and dirt. You notice, with
that perception check, a few carts, a few broken

1189
01:27:39,384 --> 01:27:49,418
boxes, some tables or contraptions. There's some
semblance of civilization here amongst these hills

1190
01:27:49,418 --> 01:27:50,630
off the road.

1191
01:27:50,630 --> 01:27:54,609
LAURA: (gasps) There's carts! I see the carts! I
jump up and down in her hands.

1192
01:27:54,609 --> 01:27:56,541
MARISHA: Oh god-- (grunts)

1193
01:27:56,541 --> 01:27:58,515
SAM: Are there people in the carts?

1194
01:27:58,515 --> 01:27:59,800
MATT: She drops you.

1195
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:01,928
LAURA: Oh, are there people in the carts? Can I
see?

1196
01:28:01,928 --> 01:28:03,326
MATT: They appear to be empty.

1197
01:28:03,326 --> 01:28:04,414
LAURA: They're empty!

1198
01:28:04,414 --> 01:28:05,371
SAM: Abandoned?

1199
01:28:05,371 --> 01:28:06,452
LAURA: Maybe.

1200
01:28:06,452 --> 01:28:07,559
SAM: I'm going to start drinking.

1201
01:28:07,559 --> 01:28:08,611
MARISHA: Jester, I'm going to put you down.

1202
01:28:08,611 --> 01:28:09,810
MATT: Okay. How much do you drink?

1203
01:28:09,810 --> 01:28:12,366
SAM: I'm going to take three big swigs.

1204
01:28:12,366 --> 01:28:13,880
MATT: Okay, good to know.

1205
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:19,848
LIAM: I would like to use Frumpkin to do a
once-around from above to see if any of those

1206
01:28:19,848 --> 01:28:24,520
beasts are on the horizon anywhere for us to kill,
and also if there are any survivors or anything here.

1207
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:26,114
MATT: Perception check for Frumpkin.

1208
01:28:26,114 --> 01:28:28,820
LIAM: That is a 13.

1209
01:28:28,820 --> 01:28:30,076
MATT: 13, good to know.

1210
01:28:30,076 --> 01:28:33,926
LAURA: Should we pull the cart over and sneak up?

1211
01:28:33,926 --> 01:28:37,139
TRAVIS: Yes. By foot is how we should proceed.

1212
01:28:37,139 --> 01:28:41,165
LAURA: Okay. Let's pull the cart over and hide it
in the grass.

1213
01:28:41,165 --> 01:28:43,659
MARISHA: Yeah. I help Jester hide the cart.

1214
01:28:43,659 --> 01:28:46,808
LAURA: Oh, but our horses. What if they get
eaten?

1215
01:28:46,808 --> 01:28:54,019
SAM: (nervous) It's all right. It's fine. We don't
care about the horses. Let's just save ourselves.

1216
01:28:54,019 --> 01:28:55,601
Who cares about the horses?

1217
01:28:55,601 --> 01:28:59,422
LAURA: But how are we going to get all the people
back if we don't have horses to pull the cart?

1218
01:28:59,422 --> 01:29:00,778
SAM: That's true.

1219
01:29:00,778 --> 01:29:04,998
LIAM: From 100 feet up, I can see through
Frumpkin's eyes all of us being a bunch of dumb

1220
01:29:04,998 --> 01:29:06,404
fucks in the back of the cart.

1221
01:29:06,404 --> 01:29:08,167
MATT: It's true.

1222
01:29:08,167 --> 01:29:11,919
SAM: Should we leave someone back to protect the
horses?

1223
01:29:11,919 --> 01:29:13,622
TRAVIS: No.

1224
01:29:13,622 --> 01:29:14,941
MARISHA: Seems a waste.

1225
01:29:14,941 --> 01:29:18,317
TRAVIS: Would you want to be the one person that
got attacked with the horses by yourself?

1226
01:29:18,317 --> 01:29:20,302
SAM: No.

1227
01:29:20,302 --> 01:29:23,018
TRAVIS: Yeah, I didn't think so. We stick
together.

1228
01:29:23,018 --> 01:29:27,121
SAM: All right. I'll be part of the Fjord
expedition.

1229
01:29:27,121 --> 01:29:32,271
(laughter and groaning)

1230
01:29:32,271 --> 01:29:34,783
LIAM: The crew! The crew groaned!

1231
01:29:34,783 --> 01:29:37,668
LAURA: I heard a groan.

1232
01:29:37,668 --> 01:29:42,238
SAM: That wasn't a groan, that was like-- ugh.

1233
01:29:42,238 --> 01:29:43,742
LIAM: Disgust?

1234
01:29:43,742 --> 01:29:45,820
TALIESIN: That was nausea!

1235
01:29:45,820 --> 01:29:49,931
MATT: I feel like I passed a stone.

1236
01:29:49,931 --> 01:29:58,053
TRAVIS: Yep. Now I'm ready to die.

1237
01:29:58,053 --> 01:30:02,056
(laughter)

1238
01:30:02,056 --> 01:30:04,441
MATT: All right, what's the plan, guys?

1239
01:30:04,441 --> 01:30:08,250
LAURA: I'm going to-- does anybody have to
sneeze?

1240
01:30:08,250 --> 01:30:10,053
TRAVIS and SAM: What?

1241
01:30:10,053 --> 01:30:11,474
LAURA: Anybody feel like they need to--

1242
01:30:11,474 --> 01:30:12,356
TALIESIN: Should we?

1243
01:30:12,356 --> 01:30:13,865
SAM: Sneeze? What? Why--

1244
01:30:13,865 --> 01:30:16,044
TRAVIS: That would give away our stealthy
approach.

1245
01:30:16,044 --> 01:30:17,502
SAM: Oh. I see.

1246
01:30:17,502 --> 01:30:20,861
LAURA: Because... Bless you! I give you Blessing of
the Trickster.

1247
01:30:20,861 --> 01:30:22,716
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

1248
01:30:22,716 --> 01:30:25,252
LIAM: I was waiting for the punchline.

1249
01:30:25,252 --> 01:30:27,695
TALIESIN: What does Blessing of the Trickster do?

1250
01:30:27,695 --> 01:30:28,938
LAURA: You have advantage on stealth.

1251
01:30:28,938 --> 01:30:30,355
TALIESIN: I have advantage on "smealth," that's
great.

1252
01:30:30,355 --> 01:30:31,299
MATT: "Smealth."

1253
01:30:31,299 --> 01:30:33,522
TALIESIN: On "smealth." He who "smealth" it.

1254
01:30:33,522 --> 01:30:38,695
MATT: Mm-hmm. All right, what are you guys doing
with the cart and the horses?

1255
01:30:38,695 --> 01:30:41,458
LAURA: We're hiding it in the tall grass.

1256
01:30:41,458 --> 01:30:42,541
MATT: Okay.

1257
01:30:42,541 --> 01:30:49,355
TRAVIS: No rocks around, right? No stones or
boulders in the field?

1258
01:30:49,355 --> 01:30:55,110
MATT: Not that big. The hills themselves are--
it's just large rolling hills in this whole valley area.

1259
01:30:55,110 --> 01:30:58,237
TRAVIS: I was trying to get it in the depression
of a rolling hill and just--

1260
01:30:58,237 --> 01:31:00,212
MATT: Okay. You have to back up a bit to get it
out of view.

1261
01:31:00,212 --> 01:31:03,735
LIAM: I'd like to point out that we came up with a
loose plan, but we're not doing that plan.

1262
01:31:03,735 --> 01:31:06,994
LAURA: What was our loose plan? We didn't see any
of them?

1263
01:31:06,994 --> 01:31:09,367
TRAVIS: We haven't seen anything yet.

1264
01:31:09,367 --> 01:31:11,750
MARISHA: We're not in any tree line or anything.

1265
01:31:11,750 --> 01:31:15,238
LIAM: Also, in a pinch, we could kill the horses.

1266
01:31:15,238 --> 01:31:19,934
TRAVIS: Kill the horses? Oh, to use as-- that's
right, we could.

1267
01:31:19,934 --> 01:31:25,632
LAURA: But we won't be able to pull the cart. I'm
really strong, but I don't know if I can carry

1268
01:31:25,632 --> 01:31:26,951
that many people.

1269
01:31:26,951 --> 01:31:28,635
SAM: She's lying, she's not really strong.

1270
01:31:28,635 --> 01:31:30,400
LAURA: I am really strong, though.

1271
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:31,410
SAM: Really?

1272
01:31:31,410 --> 01:31:35,589
TALIESIN: We wouldn't have to kill the horse, we
could just send the horse--

1273
01:31:35,589 --> 01:31:38,760
TRAVIS: Let's find out what we see first, and then
we'll decide.

1274
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:40,488
TALIESIN: Sure. Recon.

1275
01:31:40,488 --> 01:31:42,045
LAURA: That's not normally how you test strength.

1276
01:31:42,045 --> 01:31:43,360
SAM: I don't know, I'm not strong.

1277
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:44,647
MARISHA: Let's flank. Around.

1278
01:31:44,647 --> 01:31:46,846
TRAVIS: Everybody fan out in a firing line, just
one straight line--

1279
01:31:46,846 --> 01:31:48,037
SAM: We're going away from each other?

1280
01:31:48,037 --> 01:31:52,122
TRAVIS: Just within eye distance, right? But keep
a line.

1281
01:31:52,122 --> 01:31:54,423
TALIESIN: Answered my question. I was curious what
flanking was.

1282
01:31:54,423 --> 01:31:57,424
TRAVIS: Keep in line. We're going to move towards
the cart. We're going to use the tall grass.

1283
01:31:57,424 --> 01:31:59,506
LAURA: Towards the three carts?

1284
01:31:59,506 --> 01:32:00,406
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1285
01:32:00,406 --> 01:32:08,501
MARISHA: Do we need to have some sort of awesome
whistle or something? To communicate with each other?

1286
01:32:08,501 --> 01:32:10,308
TRAVIS: I'm open to it, if you have any.

1287
01:32:10,308 --> 01:32:13,016
MARISHA: Oh, what was that thing you did in the
circus? That was cool.

1288
01:32:13,016 --> 01:32:15,733
(whistling)

1289
01:32:15,733 --> 01:32:17,290
LIAM: (spitting noise) I can't do that.

1290
01:32:17,290 --> 01:32:26,463
(various whistling noises)

1291
01:32:26,463 --> 01:32:28,842
LIAM: How about we don't make any noise at all,
but we just sneak in?

1292
01:32:28,842 --> 01:32:30,302
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's do that.

1293
01:32:30,302 --> 01:32:36,044
MATT: Having placed the cart where what you assume
is the best you can hide it, who is helming the

1294
01:32:36,044 --> 01:32:37,571
hiding of the cart?

1295
01:32:37,571 --> 01:32:38,766
LAURA: Me!

1296
01:32:38,766 --> 01:32:40,460
MATT: Go ahead and make a survival check.

1297
01:32:40,460 --> 01:32:42,207
LIAM: I will also help with that.

1298
01:32:42,207 --> 01:32:44,439
MATT: All right. If you're aiding, then do it with
advantage.

1299
01:32:44,439 --> 01:32:48,713
LIAM: Okay. Lift with the legs!

1300
01:32:48,713 --> 01:32:50,036
LAURA: 13.

1301
01:32:50,036 --> 01:32:53,845
MATT: Okay. I mean, sure.

1302
01:32:53,845 --> 01:32:57,494
LAURA: I get some grass and I put it on the cart.

1303
01:32:57,494 --> 01:33:02,897
SAM: Put your alarm around the cart! You do it all
the time!

1304
01:33:02,897 --> 01:33:05,183
LIAM: Do we have the time for that right now?

1305
01:33:05,183 --> 01:33:06,402
SAM: How long does it take to cast?

1306
01:33:06,402 --> 01:33:11,929
LIAM: Right now, it will take me 11 minutes to do
that.

1307
01:33:11,929 --> 01:33:13,429
LAURA: Yeah, do it, do it!

1308
01:33:13,429 --> 01:33:17,993
TRAVIS: People's lives. Urgency. Clock. Time. All
that stuff.

1309
01:33:17,993 --> 01:33:19,972
LAURA: Ten minutes. Okay.

1310
01:33:19,972 --> 01:33:23,045
SAM: All right, let's just go.

1311
01:33:23,045 --> 01:33:24,489
MATT: What is the marching order?

1312
01:33:24,489 --> 01:33:28,941
LIAM: We're coming in as a line together.

1313
01:33:28,941 --> 01:33:30,850
MATT: All right. What's the order of the line,
then?

1314
01:33:30,850 --> 01:33:33,806
TRAVIS: We're all even moving forward.

1315
01:33:33,806 --> 01:33:36,187
LAURA: But what is the order of the line?

1316
01:33:36,187 --> 01:33:38,735
SAM: I'm to the left of Caleb there on the end.

1317
01:33:38,735 --> 01:33:43,952
LIAM: I don't want to be on an end. I don't want
<i>you</i> to be on the end.

1318
01:33:43,952 --> 01:33:45,654
TRAVIS: I don't mind being on an end. How about
that?

1319
01:33:45,654 --> 01:33:50,283
MARISHA: Yeah, I imagine that the ends are going
to be where you need the most strength, right?

1320
01:33:50,283 --> 01:33:54,348
LIAM: I would grab Nott by the shoulder and pull
us into the middle somehow.

1321
01:33:54,348 --> 01:33:56,141
TRAVIS: You want to be in the middle?

1322
01:33:56,141 --> 01:33:57,136
LIAM: Yes.

1323
01:33:57,136 --> 01:33:59,392
SAM: Let's walk with Molly. There. Boom. Got it.

1324
01:33:59,392 --> 01:34:00,669
MARISHA: Great.

1325
01:34:00,669 --> 01:34:11,170
MATT: All right. We have: Molly, Nott, Caleb,
Jester, Beau, then Fjord. Okay. I would like you

1326
01:34:11,170 --> 01:34:13,944
all to make a stealth check, please. As you make
your way through the grass.

1327
01:34:13,944 --> 01:34:19,851
TALIESIN: That helps.

1328
01:34:19,851 --> 01:34:21,384
SAM: 21.

1329
01:34:21,384 --> 01:34:23,348
TRAVIS: 15.

1330
01:34:23,348 --> 01:34:24,441
MARISHA: 16.

1331
01:34:24,441 --> 01:34:25,352
LIAM: 12.

1332
01:34:25,352 --> 01:34:26,565
TALIESIN: 16.

1333
01:34:26,565 --> 01:34:27,505
LAURA: Ten.

1334
01:34:27,505 --> 01:34:30,108
LIAM: Those monster calves.

1335
01:34:30,108 --> 01:34:36,726
MATT: As you guys stay low to the grass, pushing
through with your hands carefully as you go,

1336
01:34:36,726 --> 01:34:43,769
hearing the wind occasionally rise and fall with a
distant (shh), the various waves of grass beating

1337
01:34:43,769 --> 01:34:49,477
against itself, you come upon where the grass
begins to fall off. You stay low as best you can

1338
01:34:49,477 --> 01:34:54,293
before the grass itself comes to an end right on
the outskirts of where the central area between

1339
01:34:54,293 --> 01:35:00,300
these hills begins. There, as you poke your head
through, you can see three carts that are

1340
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:14,084
scattered a bit amongst a mineshaft yard. The
exterior of a mine. You can see large, wooden pan

1341
01:35:14,084 --> 01:35:23,151
tables; some pickaxes that are leaning against the
side, the remnants of some lanterns that have

1342
01:35:23,151 --> 01:35:31,284
rusted. There are the three carts. The carts
themselves are spattered with blood. You notice

1343
01:35:31,284 --> 01:35:38,572
three creatures, similar to the gnolls that you
saw the night before, but smaller and dog-like.

1344
01:35:38,572 --> 01:35:46,308
These are just basic hyenas that are gathered
around and are licking the blood that's soaked

1345
01:35:46,308 --> 01:35:51,600
into the wood. One of them ends up finding a piece
of meat, or something that was hanging from one

1346
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:57,352
side, and tears it off. Another one comes over
(whines) and bites onto it, and they begin tearing

1347
01:35:57,352 --> 01:36:03,985
and fighting over it before one of them pushes the
other over and it (yelps). It goes back and begins

1348
01:36:03,985 --> 01:36:09,112
licking the blood off the side of the wood. These
three hyenas are just scavenging on the outskirt

1349
01:36:09,112 --> 01:36:10,197
of these carts.

1350
01:36:10,197 --> 01:36:14,925
SAM: They're just hyenas? They're not magical,
undead hyenas?

1351
01:36:14,925 --> 01:36:16,594
MATT: Not from what you can tell.

1352
01:36:16,594 --> 01:36:21,333
TRAVIS: Can we see how many entrances there are to
this mine yard?

1353
01:36:21,333 --> 01:36:23,528
MATT: From this distance, you can't see any
entrances.

1354
01:36:23,528 --> 01:36:25,901
MARISHA: Do you think they're centurions?

1355
01:36:25,901 --> 01:36:30,630
LIAM: I think they're going to make a big fucking
stink if we--

1356
01:36:30,630 --> 01:36:33,599
MARISHA: If they see us? I'll bet they're the alert
system.

1357
01:36:33,599 --> 01:36:35,729
LAURA: (whispers) We should kill them!

1358
01:36:35,729 --> 01:36:38,729
MARISHA: But we have to kill them all at once.

1359
01:36:38,729 --> 01:36:40,127
LIAM: That is correct.

1360
01:36:40,127 --> 01:36:47,590
TRAVIS: I could make a distraction. Nott, Beau,
are y'all fast, quick, and quiet?

1361
01:36:47,590 --> 01:36:49,071
SAM: Yes.

1362
01:36:49,071 --> 01:36:50,201
LAURA: Sure.

1363
01:36:50,201 --> 01:36:51,417
TRAVIS: Who else?

1364
01:36:51,417 --> 01:36:53,367
SAM: No, just us.

1365
01:36:53,367 --> 01:36:55,181
TALIESIN: I'm quietish.

1366
01:36:55,181 --> 01:36:56,282
TRAVIS: There's three of them, right?

1367
01:36:56,282 --> 01:36:58,046
MARISHA: Yeah.

1368
01:36:58,046 --> 01:36:59,110
TRAVIS: All right.

1369
01:36:59,110 --> 01:37:05,833
MARISHA: You want to try and make a distraction
and bring them closer? To us? Then we can jump out

1370
01:37:05,833 --> 01:37:11,456
of the grass? Do the old "jump out of the
grass--"

1371
01:37:11,456 --> 01:37:14,571
TRAVIS: About how far from the edge of the grass,
where we are, to them?

1372
01:37:14,571 --> 01:37:16,857
MATT: About 50 or so feet. 60 feet.

1373
01:37:16,857 --> 01:37:29,631
TRAVIS: Can I use Minor Illusion to create a plump
little bunny and have it hop out of the grass? But

1374
01:37:29,631 --> 01:37:32,500
its front leg looks a little lame.

1375
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:34,859
MARISHA: Oh, buddy.

1376
01:37:34,859 --> 01:37:43,123
MATT: Quietly, this plump, wounded, with a hint of
pink to the fur around the arm where it looks like

1377
01:37:43,123 --> 01:37:48,247
it may have been bleeding a bit, begins to hobble
its way silently out of the grass, just beyond the edge.

1378
01:37:48,247 --> 01:37:50,916
SAM: I'm going to hide.

1379
01:37:50,916 --> 01:37:52,679
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to hide.

1380
01:37:52,679 --> 01:37:54,003
MATT: You guys are still hidden.

1381
01:37:54,003 --> 01:37:59,592
TALIESIN: I'm going to draw one of my swords and,
just out of experiment, try and get it to do that

1382
01:37:59,592 --> 01:38:04,274
weird thing it did yesterday. With my hand.

1383
01:38:04,274 --> 01:38:11,787
MATT: You initiate the Rite, and as you do, the
blade begins to give a faint, radiant glow, a

1384
01:38:11,787 --> 01:38:15,280
whitish-yellow light that you will almost
instinctually hold low in the grass to make sure

1385
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:26,838
you don't become a beacon amongst your hiding. You
watch as one of the hyenas (sniffing) and begins

1386
01:38:26,838 --> 01:38:33,584
making its way. The others look over (snarl)--
they begin to gather up, and the three almost go

1387
01:38:33,584 --> 01:38:39,972
into this pack swoop formation in the direction of
the rabbit, closing in. 40 feet, 30 feet, 20 feet.

1388
01:38:39,972 --> 01:38:49,654
With a rapid bolt, one of them runs forward and
leaps out towards the rabbit and skids into the

1389
01:38:49,654 --> 01:38:52,886
dirt past it, right to the front of the grassline
where you are, Beau.

1390
01:38:52,886 --> 01:38:54,100
TRAVIS: Now!

1391
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:55,775
MARISHA: (slamming)

1392
01:38:55,775 --> 01:38:59,779
LAURA: I use Sacred Flame on the one next it.

1393
01:38:59,779 --> 01:39:01,463
MATT: Okay, and who is doing what else?

1394
01:39:01,463 --> 01:39:02,966
TALIESIN: I'm going to stab the third one.

1395
01:39:02,966 --> 01:39:07,759
MATT: The three of you rush out and attack, three
individual ones. What are you guys doing?

1396
01:39:07,759 --> 01:39:13,263
LIAM: I will send Frumpkin down to the one that
Jester's attacking, right up against it to

1397
01:39:13,297 --> 01:39:14,893
distract and chirp in its face.

1398
01:39:14,893 --> 01:39:18,134
MATT: All right. Beau, go ahead and attack first.

1399
01:39:18,134 --> 01:39:22,661
MARISHA: I'm going to take the blunt end of the
staff and go right for it as it skids by, I'm

1400
01:39:22,661 --> 01:39:31,139
going to take right in its neck. Ooh, not great.
Ten.

1401
01:39:31,139 --> 01:39:37,955
MATT: Ten? You go to swing, and as it sees you
suddenly, it backs away, and your staff hits the

1402
01:39:37,955 --> 01:39:44,258
dirt right next to it. (snarls) It just barely
misses it. Caleb, you following up?

1403
01:39:44,258 --> 01:39:50,528
LIAM: Caleb sends Frumpkin right down to the
one that Jester was attacking and I will send out

1404
01:39:50,528 --> 01:39:53,069
a Fire Bolt at the same time.

1405
01:39:53,069 --> 01:39:56,222
MATT: Go for it. Roll your attack roll for the
Fire Bolt.

1406
01:39:56,222 --> 01:39:59,526
LIAM: That's at advantage if my birdie is
bothering him up close.

1407
01:39:59,526 --> 01:40:03,730
MATT: Right. Okay. Wait, you're going for the one
that Jester is attacking?

1408
01:40:03,730 --> 01:40:05,082
LIAM: Yeah, the one that Jester is attacking.

1409
01:40:05,082 --> 01:40:06,259
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

1410
01:40:06,259 --> 01:40:10,630
LIAM: That is-- oh, that's good. That is 21.

1411
01:40:10,630 --> 01:40:12,133
MATT: 21 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

1412
01:40:12,133 --> 01:40:20,430
LIAM: These spells are all still new to me. Oh, that's a
big one.

1413
01:40:20,430 --> 01:40:22,081
MATT: One point of damage.

1414
01:40:22,081 --> 01:40:23,410
LIAM: Big one point of damage.

1415
01:40:23,410 --> 01:40:30,065
MATT: It begins to burn this small circular image
on the hyena's body. (yelping)

1416
01:40:30,065 --> 01:40:31,265
Go ahead and--

1417
01:40:31,265 --> 01:40:33,402
LAURA: It just has to make a dex save of over 13.

1418
01:40:33,402 --> 01:40:34,699
MATT: With a natural one, he does not.

1419
01:40:34,699 --> 01:40:38,319
LAURA: Yay. Then he gets four more damage,
radiant.

1420
01:40:38,319 --> 01:40:43,371
MATT: That's enough. With the blast of the Fire
Bolt, and the incineration of the Sacred Flame,

1421
01:40:43,371 --> 01:40:48,962
you watch as that hyena bursts into fire and flops
to the ground while it burns, smouldering, its

1422
01:40:48,962 --> 01:40:53,753
flesh becoming the meals it had previously feasted
upon. Molly and Nott?

1423
01:40:53,753 --> 01:41:05,772
TALIESIN: I'll take my run first? That's a-- wow.
17. My brain.

1424
01:41:05,772 --> 01:41:07,864
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

1425
01:41:07,864 --> 01:41:12,522
TALIESIN: That's seven points, plus three radiant.

1426
01:41:12,522 --> 01:41:17,686
MATT: The first strike just completely cleaves it
in half, like its momentum, running, almost like

1427
01:41:17,686 --> 01:41:22,535
it hits the blade, and you hold it out and the
momentum just carries it over, seamlessly carving

1428
01:41:22,535 --> 01:41:23,817
through it.

1429
01:41:23,817 --> 01:41:26,325
TALIESIN: Am I close enough to hit the third one
that's still left with my second attack?

1430
01:41:26,325 --> 01:41:29,106
MATT: You can have movement to close it. There's
one right in front of Beau, so you're a little

1431
01:41:29,106 --> 01:41:31,364
ways away, but you can close the gap, while Nott
and--

1432
01:41:31,364 --> 01:41:34,330
MARISHA: I didn't get my bonus attack on that guy.
Can I get my bonus attack?

1433
01:41:34,330 --> 01:41:35,481
MATT: Yep!

1434
01:41:35,481 --> 01:41:40,044
MARISHA: Okay. I want to try and bring my heel
down on top of it as it tries to scooch away.

1435
01:41:40,044 --> 01:41:42,321
Fucking-- did you see that?

1436
01:41:42,321 --> 01:41:43,260
TRAVIS: I did.

1437
01:41:43,260 --> 01:41:44,399
LIAM: Yep. 17 to a three.

1438
01:41:44,399 --> 01:41:47,485
LAURA: You need to not use that dice for the rest
of the night.

1439
01:41:47,485 --> 01:41:48,594
MARISHA: Nine.

1440
01:41:48,594 --> 01:41:49,417
MATT: Nine.

1441
01:41:49,417 --> 01:41:50,308
MARISHA: Nine.

1442
01:41:50,308 --> 01:41:51,168
MATT: Nine, again!

1443
01:41:51,168 --> 01:41:52,316
SAM and TALIESIN: Nein!

1444
01:41:52,316 --> 01:41:56,208
MATT: At first it hits the dirt, and it backs up.
You move out with your heel to go ahead and swing,

1445
01:41:56,277 --> 01:42:01,923
and it actually ducks underneath and tries to snap
at your heel, as Molly closes the gap, and--

1446
01:42:01,923 --> 01:42:03,654
TRAVIS: Would you like to go?

1447
01:42:03,654 --> 01:42:07,929
SAM: I release my bolt at that same one.

1448
01:42:07,929 --> 01:42:09,166
MATT: All right.

1449
01:42:09,166 --> 01:42:10,176
SAM: 20.

1450
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:12,147
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll damage. With
sneak attack.

1451
01:42:12,147 --> 01:42:17,654
SAM: 13.

1452
01:42:17,654 --> 01:42:21,433
MATT: Yeah, Molly, as you rush up, you watch as a
bolt just goes right through the side of the

1453
01:42:21,433 --> 01:42:26,843
hyena's head, and it just falls lifeless to the
ground. All three of them out in a split second.

1454
01:42:26,843 --> 01:42:31,828
TRAVIS: I don't want to, like, make y'all alarmed
or anything, but that was kind of fucking efficient.

1455
01:42:31,828 --> 01:42:35,955
LAURA: Everybody but Beau, you were missing like
crazy on that one.

1456
01:42:35,955 --> 01:42:38,164
MARISHA: You know, I had a long day yesterday,
okay?

1457
01:42:38,164 --> 01:42:39,355
TRAVIS: Hands are sweaty?

1458
01:42:39,355 --> 01:42:41,858
MARISHA: Just was faster than I thought.

1459
01:42:41,858 --> 01:42:45,580
LAURA: Hey, look! We can use this hyena meat as
bait!

1460
01:42:45,580 --> 01:42:46,783
TRAVIS: You're right.

1461
01:42:46,783 --> 01:42:54,162
SAM: I'm going to go pull my bolt out of the
thing. Is it recoverable?

1462
01:42:54,162 --> 01:42:55,224
TALIESIN: Good shot.

1463
01:42:55,224 --> 01:42:58,071
MATT: Yeah, thankfully it was a clean enough shot,
didn't seem to get caught or shatter against any

1464
01:42:58,071 --> 01:42:59,284
of the bones.

1465
01:42:59,284 --> 01:43:01,803
TRAVIS: Quick perimeter check to see if we alerted
anything, anything's looking at us.

1466
01:43:01,803 --> 01:43:03,470
MATT: Perception check.

1467
01:43:03,470 --> 01:43:05,261
TRAVIS: Natural 19.

1468
01:43:05,261 --> 01:43:10,295
MATT: Glancing about the vicinity, does not look
like anything else is moving or near or has

1469
01:43:10,295 --> 01:43:11,547
noticed your presence.

1470
01:43:11,547 --> 01:43:15,575
TRAVIS: Move to the cart, quick check of anything
left behind, clues.

1471
01:43:15,575 --> 01:43:17,581
SAM: Do we need to drag these bodies?

1472
01:43:17,581 --> 01:43:20,687
TRAVIS: There's no bodies, just blood spatter.

1473
01:43:20,687 --> 01:43:21,776
MARISHA: Do you mean the hyenas?

1474
01:43:21,776 --> 01:43:22,652
SAM: The hyenas.

1475
01:43:22,652 --> 01:43:27,128
TRAVIS: Oh. We've got to figure out where we're
going first.

1476
01:43:27,128 --> 01:43:31,464
TALIESIN: I'm also going to point out, they hadn't
been eating the hyenas anyway, so maybe leaving

1477
01:43:31,464 --> 01:43:33,974
bodies of their pets is not the greatest idea?

1478
01:43:33,974 --> 01:43:35,886
LAURA: Toss them into the grass, then, to get them
out of view?

1479
01:43:35,886 --> 01:43:37,387
TALIESIN: That might be a smarter way to go.

1480
01:43:37,387 --> 01:43:38,359
TRAVIS: Do it.

1481
01:43:38,359 --> 01:43:42,369
LAURA: Okay, I'll pick them up and throw them as
far as I can into the grass.

1482
01:43:42,369 --> 01:43:50,326
MATT: Okay. Like a massive shotput, you watch as
tiny Jester, with a double spin each, chucks these

1483
01:43:50,326 --> 01:43:57,264
relatively heavy beasts deep into the grass field,
where they vanish with a heavy thud into the field.

1484
01:43:57,264 --> 01:43:59,869
LIAM: She's like Miss Trunchbull from Matilda.

1485
01:43:59,869 --> 01:44:01,874
TRAVIS: You're a lot stronger than you look.

1486
01:44:01,874 --> 01:44:06,963
LAURA: Thank you! Hey, what happened to the little
bunny, though? I'm going to look for the little

1487
01:44:06,963 --> 01:44:08,090
white rabbit.

1488
01:44:08,090 --> 01:44:09,184
TALIESIN: Oh dear.

1489
01:44:09,184 --> 01:44:13,204
MATT: Bunny appears to no longer be around.

1490
01:44:13,204 --> 01:44:16,064
LAURA: That's really sad, they ate it.

1491
01:44:16,064 --> 01:44:18,160
TRAVIS: Yeah, boy, sure did.

1492
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:19,860
SAM: We'll have a funeral later.

1493
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:23,647
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep a hold of my sword,
but I'm going to wrap it in the coat so it's not

1494
01:44:23,647 --> 01:44:25,656
glowing ridiculously.

1495
01:44:25,656 --> 01:44:29,670
LIAM: There's just the carts, there's the one mine
entrance?

1496
01:44:29,670 --> 01:44:33,845
MATT: You don't see an entrance to the mine, you
just see mining equipment.

1497
01:44:33,845 --> 01:44:38,128
MARISHA: Oh, mining. I misunderstood that, too.

1498
01:44:38,128 --> 01:44:46,020
MATT: You see pieces of equipment, and the
interior of this hill valley, this short little

1499
01:44:46,020 --> 01:44:50,397
valley, seems to have been prepped for some sort
of mining expedition.

1500
01:44:50,397 --> 01:44:51,991
SAM: There's no mine hole?

1501
01:44:51,991 --> 01:44:53,779
MATT: You don't see one at the moment.

1502
01:44:53,779 --> 01:44:57,799
LIAM: I'll take a look around to see if there's
anything, where they started or anything like that?

1503
01:44:57,799 --> 01:44:59,815
MARISHA: I'll take the opposite side that he's
doing.

1504
01:44:59,815 --> 01:45:02,129
SAM: I'm going to look in the carts.

1505
01:45:02,129 --> 01:45:09,058
MATT: Okay. You look in the carts, and they are
empty. You see a few wayward pieces of cloth,

1506
01:45:09,058 --> 01:45:13,453
everything in there is bloodied and caked, and has
streaks of it being licked up. It looks like the

1507
01:45:13,453 --> 01:45:18,325
hyenas had been at it for a while, trying to clear
off what was left behind from wherever the bodies

1508
01:45:18,325 --> 01:45:25,817
that were within were taken. I would like you both
to make investigation checks, please. And you're

1509
01:45:25,817 --> 01:45:27,221
following the tracks?

1510
01:45:27,221 --> 01:45:28,125
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

1511
01:45:28,125 --> 01:45:29,261
MATT: Make a survival check.

1512
01:45:29,261 --> 01:45:30,319
TALIESIN: With advantage?

1513
01:45:30,319 --> 01:45:32,373
MATT: Because there are undead as a part of this,
I will let you.

1514
01:45:32,373 --> 01:45:33,931
TALIESIN: Survival check.

1515
01:45:33,931 --> 01:45:36,681
MARISHA and TALIESIN: 14.

1516
01:45:36,681 --> 01:45:38,286
LIAM: 20.

1517
01:45:38,286 --> 01:45:47,795
MATT: It looks like the dust and the dirt in this
vicinity has been freshly swept or dispersed

1518
01:45:47,795 --> 01:45:53,127
intentionally, meaning that once this little
valley had been entered, and the carts had been

1519
01:45:53,127 --> 01:45:58,996
emptied, something was smart enough to
intentionally cover their tracks. You, however--

1520
01:45:58,996 --> 01:46:06,469
you rolled a 20, you said? As you begin to look
about the base of the closest hill, facing away

1521
01:46:06,469 --> 01:46:18,921
from where you guys had entered, in an eastern
direction, you see a pattern of grasses that seem

1522
01:46:18,921 --> 01:46:27,528
to be interwoven, as opposed to a natural pattern,
there is a consistent mesh to the way they've been laid.

1523
01:46:27,528 --> 01:46:28,656
SAM: It's a comb-over.

1524
01:46:28,656 --> 01:46:30,575
LAURA: It looks like how we put the stuff over the
cart.

1525
01:46:30,575 --> 01:46:35,424
MATT: As you glance over, you can see a net of
grasses that has been woven and thrown over,

1526
01:46:35,424 --> 01:46:41,058
leaving a small gap on the edge, where you can see
the dark exterior of what was a mine shaft

1527
01:46:41,058 --> 01:46:42,510
structure entrance.

1528
01:46:42,510 --> 01:46:44,829
LAURA: That's way smarter that what we did.

1529
01:46:44,829 --> 01:46:48,990
MARISHA: A ghillie net.

1530
01:46:48,990 --> 01:46:53,211
LIAM: But we'll remember it for the future.

1531
01:46:53,211 --> 01:46:55,066
TALIESIN: Yours was hand-crafted.

1532
01:46:55,066 --> 01:46:56,489
SAM: Why don't we just take this one?

1533
01:46:56,489 --> 01:46:59,431
MARISHA: That's what I was going to say, is it
heavy? How big is this thing? Can we fold it up

1534
01:46:59,431 --> 01:47:00,499
and stuff it in a bag?

1535
01:47:00,499 --> 01:47:03,118
MATT: It's about 12 foot by 12 foot.

1536
01:47:03,118 --> 01:47:04,290
MARISHA: Oh, that's big.

1537
01:47:04,290 --> 01:47:06,165
LAURA: It could fit in a backpack. Maybe roll up.

1538
01:47:06,165 --> 01:47:07,864
MATT: It's pretty thick.

1539
01:47:07,864 --> 01:47:09,111
SAM: It's got sticks.

1540
01:47:09,111 --> 01:47:15,102
MATT: Well, it's thrown on and put against the
grass, it doesn't have sticks in its sides.

1541
01:47:15,102 --> 01:47:16,836
SAM: Does it have a frame of any sort?

1542
01:47:16,836 --> 01:47:18,320
MATT: No, it's laid on the side of the hill.

1543
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:22,252
SAM: Oh, it's a blanket! Oh, okay. We can take
that.

1544
01:47:22,252 --> 01:47:23,967
MARISHA: We can grab it on our way back and throw
it on the cart.

1545
01:47:23,967 --> 01:47:26,172
LAURA: Throw it on the cart as we're leaving.

1546
01:47:26,172 --> 01:47:30,967
TALIESIN: I miss being low enough level that we
just take everything we find, no matter how useful.

1547
01:47:30,967 --> 01:47:34,427
LAURA: Like in Skyrim, just wheels of cheese. All
the cheese.

1548
01:47:34,427 --> 01:47:36,139
TALIESIN: We're going to be cracking open clay
pots.

1549
01:47:36,139 --> 01:47:44,367
MATT: The scavenger levels, man. All righty. It is
too big for you to carry with you, but it can

1550
01:47:44,367 --> 01:47:47,904
definitely be taken with you should you exit.

1551
01:47:47,904 --> 01:47:51,002
LIAM: How about what's behind the grass, let's
discuss this instead.

1552
01:47:51,002 --> 01:47:57,125
MATT: All right. As you pull it back, you do see
the wooden support structure of the interior of a

1553
01:47:57,125 --> 01:48:05,470
mine shaft. As soon as you pull it back and look
inside, it looks like a barricade has been

1554
01:48:05,470 --> 01:48:11,508
partially placed up on each side. You see piles of
broken furniture, stools and chairs that are

1555
01:48:11,508 --> 01:48:16,976
shattered and jammed into each other to form some
sort of a barricade on each side. You can see

1556
01:48:16,976 --> 01:48:24,568
dry-rotted pickaxe handles, and other pieces of
general wooden beams used for construction that

1557
01:48:24,568 --> 01:48:30,875
are all pushed up against the sides, with a small
path, maybe about three feet wide, that you could

1558
01:48:30,875 --> 01:48:35,130
walk through to enter. It looks pitch black on the
inside. There is no light source outside of what

1559
01:48:35,130 --> 01:48:37,744
little bit of daylight is coming through from the
entrance.

1560
01:48:37,744 --> 01:48:41,676
LIAM: Sorry, I was thinking about a thing you were
saying, there is a way through for us?

1561
01:48:41,676 --> 01:48:46,169
MATT: There is a way, there's about a two, three
foot gap between this barricade where it made its

1562
01:48:46,169 --> 01:48:52,006
way in, and once you enter through, you can now
see, since there has not been dust put, there is a

1563
01:48:52,006 --> 01:48:58,049
definitive trail of blood that has dragged through
and caked in the loose dirt and dust.

1564
01:48:58,049 --> 01:49:00,121
TALIESIN: Should I give it a little light, or no?

1565
01:49:00,121 --> 01:49:02,140
SAM: Wait, before we go in--

1566
01:49:02,140 --> 01:49:05,315
TRAVIS: You're anxious to go. You want to go
first?

1567
01:49:05,315 --> 01:49:14,530
SAM: No! Jesus, no. No, please. There were hyenas
out here, right, posted as guards? If one of the

1568
01:49:14,530 --> 01:49:20,522
hyenas had gone (hyena howl), would something have
come out of this hole to come get us?

1569
01:49:20,522 --> 01:49:23,650
LIAM: I mean, that is a fair assumption, yeah.

1570
01:49:23,650 --> 01:49:28,521
SAM: Then why don't we make that sound, and wait
for something to come out, and kill it.

1571
01:49:28,521 --> 01:49:35,988
LAURA: Well, but what if it alerts a lot of the
gnolls, and then we don't have the element of

1572
01:49:35,988 --> 01:49:37,836
surprise at all anymore?

1573
01:49:37,836 --> 01:49:39,219
LIAM: Well, we're talking--

1574
01:49:39,219 --> 01:49:41,377
SAM: You want to go into that dark, scary cave?

1575
01:49:41,377 --> 01:49:43,234
LAURA: It doesn't look that bad to me.

1576
01:49:43,234 --> 01:49:44,826
SAM: It is a dark, scary cave!

1577
01:49:44,826 --> 01:49:49,334
TRAVIS: Frumpkin is still just a sweet little
bird, so I thought maybe a little quick flight in--

1578
01:49:49,334 --> 01:49:51,953
MARISHA: Canary in a gnoll mine!

1579
01:49:51,953 --> 01:49:54,247
(laughter)

1580
01:49:54,247 --> 01:49:56,285
TRAVIS: Oh! Oh, smash!

1581
01:49:56,285 --> 01:49:58,505
LIAM: Jesus.

1582
01:49:58,505 --> 01:50:01,435
MARISHA: We have to do it, it's too perfect.

1583
01:50:01,435 --> 01:50:04,520
TRAVIS: Canary in a gnoll mine.

1584
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:08,096
LIAM: That was good.

1585
01:50:08,096 --> 01:50:10,076
TALIESIN: That was so painful.

1586
01:50:10,076 --> 01:50:11,278
MARISHA: Sorry.

1587
01:50:11,278 --> 01:50:12,681
LIAM: Do not be sorry.

1588
01:50:12,681 --> 01:50:13,954
TALIESIN: There's limits.

1589
01:50:13,954 --> 01:50:22,445
TRAVIS: I don't know if that's something Frumpkin
can do, unless, Nott, you just wanna go in there

1590
01:50:22,445 --> 01:50:23,450
and go kamikaze.

1591
01:50:23,450 --> 01:50:24,799
SAM: No! I'm drinking again.

1592
01:50:24,799 --> 01:50:28,394
MATT: Okay. You are now officially intoxicated.

1593
01:50:28,394 --> 01:50:30,789
SAM: I don't have to roll, it just happens?

1594
01:50:30,789 --> 01:50:33,416
MATT: Yep.

1595
01:50:33,416 --> 01:50:34,381
SAM: Great.

1596
01:50:34,381 --> 01:50:35,634
MATT: For the next hour.

1597
01:50:35,634 --> 01:50:36,827
LAURA: What does that mean?

1598
01:50:36,827 --> 01:50:38,142
SAM: I'll go in if you need me to.

1599
01:50:38,142 --> 01:50:41,166
TRAVIS: Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, yes!

1600
01:50:41,166 --> 01:50:43,066
TALIESIN: No! Oh, wow!

1601
01:50:43,066 --> 01:50:46,532
LAURA: Is that where "the Brave" comes from?

1602
01:50:46,532 --> 01:50:48,289
MARISHA: That was going to be my question!

1603
01:50:48,289 --> 01:50:55,943
TRAVIS: We get her hammered, and she's the most
fucking badass.

1604
01:50:55,943 --> 01:50:57,843
LAURA: Oh my god, this is awesome.

1605
01:50:57,843 --> 01:51:01,672
TRAVIS: Oh no.

1606
01:51:01,672 --> 01:51:05,850
LIAM: Frumpkin has been a sparrow before. Sparrows
don't have darkvision, do they?

1607
01:51:05,850 --> 01:51:06,859
MATT: No.

1608
01:51:06,859 --> 01:51:08,371
SAM: It's a night sparrow, he should have said.

1609
01:51:08,371 --> 01:51:10,776
LIAM: No, it is a regular sparrow.

1610
01:51:10,776 --> 01:51:18,206
TRAVIS: My only concern is if we draw them out,
there could be more than us, right? I just want to

1611
01:51:18,206 --> 01:51:20,014
get a quick peek, if we can.

1612
01:51:20,014 --> 01:51:24,029
LIAM: Well, I mean, I can send him in there, he'll
probably hit the wall a few times, but if there's

1613
01:51:24,029 --> 01:51:26,883
any fire or anything--

1614
01:51:26,883 --> 01:51:28,006
TRAVIS: You wouldn't mind?

1615
01:51:28,006 --> 01:51:33,271
LIAM: No, you know, I can always bring him back,
but be careful, all right? But there he goes.

1616
01:51:33,271 --> 01:51:42,296
MATT: Yeah, there's no light in there. About 25
feet in, go ahead and make a perception check.

1617
01:51:42,296 --> 01:51:45,397
LAURA: Yeah, you won't be able to see anything
through it.

1618
01:51:45,397 --> 01:51:47,067
LIAM: 21.

1619
01:51:47,067 --> 01:51:52,631
MATT: 21. What faint light is coming in from the
interior-- are you looking through?

1620
01:51:52,631 --> 01:51:53,847
LIAM: Yeah, I am.

1621
01:51:53,847 --> 01:52:03,738
MATT: Yeah. As soon as you come inside, about 40
feet in, the shaft widens into a common area. You

1622
01:52:03,738 --> 01:52:12,124
see a handful of tables, some chairs, similar to
what was placed within the barricade, some sacks

1623
01:52:12,124 --> 01:52:17,963
strewn about, some torn open and scattered across
the ground, some that are still lobbed in the corner.

1624
01:52:17,963 --> 01:52:21,281
LIAM: Is that from a light source inside, or from
sunlight coming in?

1625
01:52:21,281 --> 01:52:25,352
MATT: This is just a very high perception roll
with what little light is making its way in there.

1626
01:52:25,352 --> 01:52:33,861
And that's where it goes dark, and there's a
(thud) as Frumpkin hits a sloping ceiling.

1627
01:52:33,861 --> 01:52:36,496
MARISHA: And dies?

1628
01:52:36,496 --> 01:52:39,151
MATT: No, just hits the ground.

1629
01:52:39,151 --> 01:52:40,449
LIAM: Please, no!

1630
01:52:40,449 --> 01:52:41,993
MATT: Hits the ground, stunned.

1631
01:52:41,993 --> 01:52:44,296
LAURA: It's like those birds that hit our windows
at home.

1632
01:52:44,296 --> 01:52:46,143
MARISHA: That's right, yeah.

1633
01:52:46,143 --> 01:52:52,707
LIAM: Okay, well, I think I have seen all I am
going to see for the moment, but I didn't see

1634
01:52:52,707 --> 01:52:53,994
anything in there.

1635
01:52:53,994 --> 01:52:55,095
MATT: Not in that main area.

1636
01:52:55,095 --> 01:52:56,906
LIAM: Nothing living in there that I saw?

1637
01:52:56,906 --> 01:53:02,201
MATT: Not with what little bit Frumpkin saw with a
quick glance before it got too dark and then he

1638
01:53:02,201 --> 01:53:03,278
hit the ceiling.

1639
01:53:03,278 --> 01:53:09,061
LIAM: Okay. Nott, my friend, I think maybe this is
a time where you could-- please don't go crazy,

1640
01:53:09,061 --> 01:53:13,663
but maybe go in 30 or 40 feet, there's a room in
there, and I don't think there's anything in

1641
01:53:13,663 --> 01:53:15,544
there, but you would see.

1642
01:53:15,544 --> 01:53:18,854
SAM: (drunkenly) I'm just going to go in there and
get the gnolls.

1643
01:53:18,854 --> 01:53:22,769
LAURA: I'm gonna bless you before you go. So you
can be sneakier.

1644
01:53:22,769 --> 01:53:25,255
SAM: Great.

1645
01:53:25,255 --> 01:53:27,376
TRAVIS: Consonants are gone!

1646
01:53:27,376 --> 01:53:30,872
SAM: Can sparrows hear?

1647
01:53:30,872 --> 01:53:33,341
LIAM: I can hear through my sparrow.

1648
01:53:33,341 --> 01:53:39,335
SAM: I could bring the sparrow, you could at least
hear what's going on, like a walkie talkie.

1649
01:53:39,335 --> 01:53:40,916
MARISHA: Like a walkie talkie!

1650
01:53:40,916 --> 01:53:45,102
LIAM: That's correct. Richtig. Go.

1651
01:53:45,102 --> 01:53:49,108
SAM: Okay. I'll take the sparrow, jam it in
there.

1652
01:53:49,108 --> 01:53:56,575
LIAM: Wait, I don't want to get punched in the
face while I'm blind. Somebody please put a hand

1653
01:53:56,575 --> 01:53:57,836
on my shoulder--

1654
01:53:57,836 --> 01:53:59,047
SAM: Oh, you got to hold his hand.

1655
01:53:59,047 --> 01:54:00,071
LAURA: Are we going in?

1656
01:54:00,071 --> 01:54:02,372
SAM: No, he's going to go into that other place.

1657
01:54:02,372 --> 01:54:03,581
LAURA: Oh, okay.

1658
01:54:03,581 --> 01:54:07,183
LIAM: If something bad is going to happen, just
shake me.

1659
01:54:07,183 --> 01:54:08,728
MARISHA: I'll punch you in the face.

1660
01:54:08,728 --> 01:54:10,841
LIAM: No, don't do that, just shake me.

1661
01:54:10,841 --> 01:54:12,436
LAURA: Just tickle his balls.

1662
01:54:12,436 --> 01:54:13,714
LIAM: Don't do that, just--

1663
01:54:13,714 --> 01:54:14,974
SAM: I'm going to go in.

1664
01:54:14,974 --> 01:54:16,007
MATT: Okay.

1665
01:54:16,007 --> 01:54:18,146
TALIESIN: Punch him in the balls.

1666
01:54:18,146 --> 01:54:22,035
MATT: You move past the barricades, heading
towards the shaft-- the barricade, there's a lot

1667
01:54:22,035 --> 01:54:27,091
of stuff jammed up here at the front, almost like
it was barricaded from the inside long ago, and

1668
01:54:27,091 --> 01:54:33,859
then was cleared out partially, going through. You
make it through the 35 or so feet of the shaft, in

1669
01:54:33,859 --> 01:54:43,552
towards where it opens up, and you almost trip,
because your toe catches something, and you catch

1670
01:54:43,552 --> 01:54:49,803
yourself, and you look down to see a long piece of
rope that was stretched across that just got

1671
01:54:49,803 --> 01:54:51,634
tugged, and falls slack.

1672
01:54:51,634 --> 01:54:53,025
LAURA: Oh no, you didn't see that?

1673
01:54:53,025 --> 01:54:58,520
MATT: You hear a (creak) and with your darkvision
glance up and see what appears to be a large log

1674
01:54:58,520 --> 01:55:03,184
that had been affixed to the ceiling. (whoosh)
Comes rushing towards you. Make a dexterity saving throw.

1675
01:55:03,184 --> 01:55:05,246
LIAM: You are a wee baby rogue!

1676
01:55:05,246 --> 01:55:10,944
SAM: Great check! Disadvantage. Great check!

1677
01:55:10,944 --> 01:55:12,606
LAURA: Good! Phew!

1678
01:55:12,606 --> 01:55:14,456
SAM: What is this, dex save?

1679
01:55:14,456 --> 01:55:15,737
MATT: Dex saving throw, yeah.

1680
01:55:15,737 --> 01:55:16,810
SAM: 24!

1681
01:55:16,810 --> 01:55:28,348
MATT: With disadvantage! You, even in your
somewhat hazy drunken stupor, see it just in time

1682
01:55:28,348 --> 01:55:34,218
and back up as it (whoosh) right past your nose
and slams into the wall to the left of you. It

1683
01:55:34,218 --> 01:55:36,667
hits, and you see the dust settle from the
ceiling.

1684
01:55:36,667 --> 01:55:39,359
TRAVIS: That, my lads, was a dragon.

1685
01:55:39,359 --> 01:55:44,249
MATT: You guys all hear this (slamming) from the
inside.

1686
01:55:44,249 --> 01:55:45,872
LIAM: Oh shit.

1687
01:55:45,872 --> 01:55:47,929
SAM: I'm okay, it was just wood.

1688
01:55:47,929 --> 01:55:51,788
MARISHA: What's going on?

1689
01:55:51,788 --> 01:55:55,006
LIAM: I've heard a confusing thing. Something fell
down, but okay, we're good.

1690
01:55:55,006 --> 01:55:57,322
TALIESIN: I think we might have lost the element
of surprise.

1691
01:55:57,322 --> 01:55:59,644
SAM: Is it a bigger space in here?

1692
01:55:59,644 --> 01:56:09,567
MATT: It is, actually. It opens up to be about 35
feet across from side to side, about 45 or 50

1693
01:56:09,567 --> 01:56:13,600
towards the end and then it seems to descend into
two different pathways.

1694
01:56:13,600 --> 01:56:16,782
SAM: Any signs of life? Anything?

1695
01:56:16,782 --> 01:56:19,579
MATT: Make a perception check.

1696
01:56:19,579 --> 01:56:21,291
SAM: Eight.

1697
01:56:21,291 --> 01:56:28,242
MATT: At the moment, no. But as you're glancing
about, you can see that there are bags of supplies

1698
01:56:28,242 --> 01:56:34,701
that are partially sundered and torn open. You can
see tools, some that look pretty interesting,

1699
01:56:34,701 --> 01:56:38,941
there's a crowbar on the ground across the way,
there's other sacks that haven't been spoiled yet.

1700
01:56:38,941 --> 01:56:43,604
You see some of the burlap is dry rotted and pulls
right apart, and it looks like there might be some

1701
01:56:43,604 --> 01:56:45,146
useful things in this chamber.

1702
01:56:45,146 --> 01:56:48,547
SAM: Okay. Real quick, I'll just poke through one
of the bags.

1703
01:56:48,547 --> 01:56:53,414
MATT: Make an investigation check with
disadvantage.

1704
01:56:53,414 --> 01:56:57,686
SAM: Oh, well then, okay, eight!

1705
01:56:57,686 --> 01:57:09,846
MATT: You glance through and find a bunch of
mildewed rice grain. Right as you hear a (snort).

1706
01:57:09,846 --> 01:57:15,740
SAM: I will freeze and slowly turn to the sound.

1707
01:57:15,740 --> 01:57:22,178
MATT: You glance over, and from the right chamber
you see as two gnolls have appeared in the

1708
01:57:22,178 --> 01:57:27,836
entranceway and have entered up, called from the
sound of the heavy impacting thud on the wall but

1709
01:57:27,836 --> 01:57:28,844
a few moments ago.

1710
01:57:28,844 --> 01:57:29,916
LAURA: Are you stealthed?

1711
01:57:29,916 --> 01:57:34,944
MATT: They both-- no, he's not. She is not, sorry.
They both arrive to the top of the-- (sniffing and

1712
01:57:34,944 --> 01:57:41,117
growling). They both grab their spears.

1713
01:57:41,117 --> 01:57:46,696
SAM: I'm going to say, "Help me! Help me now,
please come in, save me, save my life!"

1714
01:57:46,696 --> 01:57:50,158
LIAM: Help me, help me now, save my life. We have
to go in! Here we go!

1715
01:57:50,158 --> 01:57:51,688
MATT: What are you doing?

1716
01:57:51,688 --> 01:57:53,898
SAM: I am going to draw and fire at one.

1717
01:57:53,898 --> 01:57:59,199
MATT: As they're both right there, rushing towards
you, you say this and you're going to pull out and

1718
01:57:59,199 --> 01:58:01,401
fire at one. The one to the right or the left?

1719
01:58:01,401 --> 01:58:03,516
SAM: The first one who spotted me.

1720
01:58:03,516 --> 01:58:06,681
MATT: The one that first spotted you would be the
one on the left, so as it's rushing towards you, go

1721
01:58:06,681 --> 01:58:07,791
ahead and fire.

1722
01:58:07,791 --> 01:58:09,366
SAM: Okay, 18.

1723
01:58:09,366 --> 01:58:10,756
MATT: 18 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

1724
01:58:10,756 --> 01:58:13,875
SAM: Eight.

1725
01:58:13,875 --> 01:58:15,880
MATT: Eight points of damage, not--

1726
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:20,177
SAM: Ten, 11 points of damage, because I'm going to
use Fury of the Small.

1727
01:58:20,177 --> 01:58:27,222
MATT: Okay, 11 points of damage. It hurts, but
it's still rushing forward. They both begin to

1728
01:58:27,222 --> 01:58:31,278
rush in to close the gap. The rest of you guys rush in;
to get to him, it will take the full round to get

1729
01:58:31,278 --> 01:58:37,369
there. You guys use your movement and dash in.
Those of you who don't have darkvision, you can't

1730
01:58:37,369 --> 01:58:38,520
see anything.

1731
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:41,275
TALIESIN: I also uncover my sword at this point,
which gives off a little bit of light.

1732
01:58:41,275 --> 01:58:49,330
MATT: A faint bit of light. At this point, any of
you with ranged abilities right now would be able

1733
01:58:49,330 --> 01:58:53,881
to strike. But before you do, two of the gnolls
rush in and are attempting to attack the small

1734
01:58:53,881 --> 01:59:00,382
goblinoid female who has walked into their lair.
The first strike, that is going to be a 21 to hit.

1735
01:59:00,382 --> 01:59:02,513
SAM: Definitely hits. Any of us.

1736
01:59:02,513 --> 01:59:10,381
MATT: That is six points of piercing damage as the
spear jams into your shoulder and scrapes down the

1737
01:59:10,381 --> 01:59:16,478
front of your chest, glances off the rest of your
armor and it hurts, but you're fine. You're still

1738
01:59:16,478 --> 01:59:20,764
feeling a little fuzzy anyway. The other one
attacks, that is going to be a 15 to hit.

1739
01:59:20,764 --> 01:59:21,875
SAM: No.

1740
01:59:21,875 --> 01:59:24,921
MATT: No. This one you do see coming, and you
dodge out of the way. But they're both right up in

1741
01:59:24,921 --> 01:59:30,447
your face right now, snarling and (growling). With
that, the guys who have ranged attacks, go for it.

1742
01:59:30,447 --> 01:59:31,745
LIAM: Wait, so the whole party ran in?

1743
01:59:31,745 --> 01:59:32,627
MATT: Yes.

1744
01:59:32,627 --> 01:59:36,327
LIAM: As that was happening, the two humans in
tandem said, "Wait, let them draw out their-- fuck!"

1745
01:59:36,327 --> 01:59:37,748
MARISHA: It's so dark!

1746
01:59:37,748 --> 01:59:43,923
MATT: So you guys have disadvantage on any of your
attacks rolls because you cannot see. You are

1747
01:59:43,923 --> 01:59:45,314
blind in the chamber.

1748
01:59:45,314 --> 01:59:46,712
LIAM: Are we doing initiative or are we just
going?

1749
01:59:46,712 --> 01:59:48,835
MATT: For this round, because there's just two
gnolls at the moment, I'm just going through

1750
01:59:48,835 --> 01:59:50,523
actions here to keep going.

1751
01:59:50,523 --> 01:59:52,160
LIAM: Dancing Lights!

1752
01:59:52,160 --> 01:59:53,648
LAURA: Guiding Bolt on the one closest to me.

1753
01:59:53,648 --> 01:59:54,906
TRAVIS: Eldritch Blast on the other one.

1754
01:59:54,906 --> 01:59:58,316
MATT: Okay, so the one that's closest to you will
be the one that already took damage from the bolt

1755
01:59:58,316 --> 02:00:01,134
so roll for attack for the Guiding Bolt.

1756
02:00:01,134 --> 02:00:04,934
LAURA: 21.

1757
02:00:04,934 --> 02:00:07,152
MATT: 21 hits. Roll damage.

1758
02:00:07,152 --> 02:00:11,368
SAM: Jesus.

1759
02:00:11,368 --> 02:00:14,038
LAURA: Six, nine, ten.

1760
02:00:14,038 --> 02:00:15,506
MATT: Ten points?

1761
02:00:15,506 --> 02:00:16,358
LAURA: Ten points.

1762
02:00:16,358 --> 02:00:21,288
MATT: The one that's now taken a crossbow bolt to
the throat and has taken a Guiding Bolt, this giant

1763
02:00:21,288 --> 02:00:29,055
blast of light explodes around this gnoll as it
yelps and it encompasses its torso with this

1764
02:00:29,055 --> 02:00:32,875
glittering light. Now the next attack against it
has advantage. It is super hurt, but still

1765
02:00:32,875 --> 02:00:34,715
standing. You're making your attack.

1766
02:00:34,715 --> 02:00:39,498
TRAVIS: Yeah, I rolled the first one, which was a
24, but with advantage. That's less, so 24.

1767
02:00:39,498 --> 02:00:41,765
MATT: You were attacking the other one, so you do
not get the benefit.

1768
02:00:41,765 --> 02:00:43,510
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, I'm sorry. 24 for the first
roll.

1769
02:00:43,510 --> 02:00:44,672
MATT: Still hits, go ahead and roll damage on that
one.

1770
02:00:44,672 --> 02:00:46,850
TRAVIS: Oh balls, that's--

1771
02:00:46,850 --> 02:00:48,554
MATT: What are you using?

1772
02:00:48,554 --> 02:00:49,702
TRAVIS: Eldritch Blast.

1773
02:00:49,702 --> 02:00:52,713
MATT: It's a d10 for damage. That's a d12.

1774
02:00:52,713 --> 02:00:54,814
TRAVIS: Oh, that is a 12. Sorry, my bad.

1775
02:00:54,814 --> 02:00:56,150
SAM: That's the other character.

1776
02:00:56,150 --> 02:01:01,660
TRAVIS: Old habits, they die hard. Nine points of
damage.

1777
02:01:01,660 --> 02:01:06,274
MATT: Nine points of damage on that one. It gets
blasted by the bolt of eldritch energy; however,

1778
02:01:06,274 --> 02:01:11,708
it's still snarling. Currently they're both
looking over at the sudden surge of newcomers.

1779
02:01:11,708 --> 02:01:15,113
TALIESIN: I've also got a distance attack. I'm
going to use Devil's Tongue on the one that just

1780
02:01:15,113 --> 02:01:16,992
survived your hit.

1781
02:01:16,992 --> 02:01:18,217
MATT: Okay, what does that do?

1782
02:01:18,217 --> 02:01:26,252
TALIESIN: I'm going to use Vicious Mockery. In
Infernal: You will feed the dogs in hell.

1783
02:01:26,252 --> 02:01:29,216
LAURA: Oh, wow, I understood that. It was scary.

1784
02:01:29,216 --> 02:01:34,928
MATT: They rolled an eight, minus-- yeah, it does
not make the save.

1785
02:01:34,928 --> 02:01:42,887
TALIESIN: It takes 1d4 psychic, which is three
points of psychic damage and has disadvantage on

1786
02:01:42,887 --> 02:01:44,071
its next attack.

1787
02:01:44,071 --> 02:01:45,248
MATT: Got it, great.

1788
02:01:45,248 --> 02:01:48,789
LIAM: Four globules of light, Dancing Lights. The
room is lit up.

1789
02:01:48,789 --> 02:01:55,031
MATT: All right. The room fills with light at this
point. The chamber fills, you can now see the

1790
02:01:55,031 --> 02:02:03,368
scenery around you. Nott, you're up first. Since
you're the first one to get a shot. There's one

1791
02:02:03,368 --> 02:02:05,202
that's super hurt and one that's kind of hurt.

1792
02:02:05,202 --> 02:02:09,133
SAM: I'll go for the super hurt one. Who's right
in front of me, right?

1793
02:02:09,133 --> 02:02:10,264
MATT: Correct.

1794
02:02:10,264 --> 02:02:11,424
SAM: What's wrong?

1795
02:02:11,424 --> 02:02:12,440
MARISHA: It fits in there!

1796
02:02:12,440 --> 02:02:13,949
LAURA: Oh yeah, that's the thing!

1797
02:02:13,949 --> 02:02:15,769
SAM: That's what I'm doing. Laura discovered this
last week.

1798
02:02:15,769 --> 02:02:19,293
LAURA: It stays up super good.

1799
02:02:19,293 --> 02:02:23,439
MATT: Nott, they're both right up in your face
snarling.

1800
02:02:23,439 --> 02:02:30,754
SAM: I'm going to go to the super hurt one and be
like (scream), grab it and I'll do Shocking Grasp.

1801
02:02:30,754 --> 02:02:38,088
MATT: Okay, so go ahead and make your melee spell
attack, I believe it is, right?

1802
02:02:38,088 --> 02:02:39,294
SAM: Yep, that's a 19.

1803
02:02:39,294 --> 02:02:40,512
MATT: 19 hits.

1804
02:02:40,512 --> 02:02:50,151
SAM: Okay, I don't know how to do this. Hold on,
is this a ten? No, that's a ten, this is an eight. Seven.

1805
02:02:50,151 --> 02:02:56,186
MATT: Seven it is. As you reach up and grab it
with your hand, you watch as a burst of electrical

1806
02:02:56,186 --> 02:03:01,919
arcane energy surges through its body. You watch
as veins pop up its torso to its neck before it

1807
02:03:01,919 --> 02:03:06,676
collapses into the ground. You have to duck out of
the way before it slams. It would have crushed you

1808
02:03:06,676 --> 02:03:10,574
if you'd stayed in the space you were, but you
sidestep in time as the gnoll falls to the ground, lifeless.

1809
02:03:10,574 --> 02:03:13,125
SAM: Am I in range-- where's the other gnoll, is
it right on me?

1810
02:03:13,125 --> 02:03:14,065
MATT: Yeah.

1811
02:03:14,065 --> 02:03:20,898
SAM: Okay, I will bonus action disengage and run
all the way around to the other side of the room.

1812
02:03:20,898 --> 02:03:25,604
MATT: Okay. On the other side. As you're doing
that, the gnoll that's right there sees you rushing

1813
02:03:25,604 --> 02:03:34,011
off, but now it's more attentive to the one who
blasted it there. I'd say, for the sake of

1814
02:03:34,011 --> 02:03:38,070
distance, since the moment you saw you fired, it
probably couldn't close the gap, so it's going to

1815
02:03:38,070 --> 02:03:41,778
drop the spear, pull out its longbow, and take a
shot at you from here.

1816
02:03:41,778 --> 02:03:43,074
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

1817
02:03:43,074 --> 02:03:45,609
MATT: It's going to be a 14 to hit, what's your
armor class?

1818
02:03:45,609 --> 02:03:46,589
TRAVIS: 14.

1819
02:03:46,589 --> 02:03:51,310
MATT: 14, all right. Not a great roll, you take
four points of piercing damage.

1820
02:03:51,310 --> 02:03:52,531
TRAVIS: Four points.

1821
02:03:52,531 --> 02:03:56,468
MATT: It catches you right in the middle of the
sternum. The armor takes the brunt of it and it

1822
02:03:56,468 --> 02:04:02,347
mostly just snaps at the impact, but it hurt.
It'll bruise. That ends the remaining gnoll's

1823
02:04:02,347 --> 02:04:06,663
turn. Next up would be Beau.

1824
02:04:06,663 --> 02:04:10,653
MARISHA: Oh, are there any close to me?

1825
02:04:10,653 --> 02:04:13,851
MATT: There's one you can close the gap with.
There's only one that's currently standing in the

1826
02:04:13,851 --> 02:04:15,797
room, the other one's been killed. It was shocked to
death by Nott.

1827
02:04:15,797 --> 02:04:22,822
MARISHA: Okay, I'll close the gap and come at it
with a big double swing from my staff.

1828
02:04:22,822 --> 02:04:24,327
MATT: Go for it.

1829
02:04:24,327 --> 02:04:26,523
MARISHA: Finally a decent roll. 19.

1830
02:04:26,523 --> 02:04:27,977
MATT: 19 hits, go ahead and roll damage.

1831
02:04:27,977 --> 02:04:34,696
MARISHA: Six plus four. That's ten points of
damage.

1832
02:04:34,696 --> 02:04:37,985
MATT: Ten points of damage, that's enough to do
it. It had already been damaged previously by

1833
02:04:37,985 --> 02:04:44,265
Fjord's Eldritch Blast and you watch as it snarls
and pulls out its bow, pulls back, notches and

1834
02:04:44,265 --> 02:04:53,709
releases the arrow. Moments after it's released,
with a quick burst of action you saunter up to its

1835
02:04:53,709 --> 02:05:00,341
side and hit it across the torso with the stick.
You feel seven different ribs break as it doubles

1836
02:05:00,341 --> 02:05:06,331
forward. As it looks at you for a second, you take
where the staff has broken in and jam upward

1837
02:05:06,331 --> 02:05:10,532
to where its lungs would be and it (chokes)
and falls to the ground, dead.

1838
02:05:10,532 --> 02:05:13,095
MARISHA: I shake it off my staff a little bit.

1839
02:05:13,095 --> 02:05:16,969
TRAVIS: Damn, you broke its ribs to get to its
organs.

1840
02:05:16,969 --> 02:05:18,821
MARISHA: It's effective.

1841
02:05:18,821 --> 02:05:20,564
LAURA: (singsong) I cut off the ears.

1842
02:05:20,564 --> 02:05:23,666
MATT: You guys take a moment here--

1843
02:05:23,666 --> 02:05:25,251
TALIESIN: Put them in the jar?

1844
02:05:25,251 --> 02:05:26,568
LAURA and TALIESIN: It's an ear jar!

1845
02:05:26,568 --> 02:05:30,518
LAURA: Our pickle jar--

1846
02:05:30,518 --> 02:05:32,486
MATT and TALIESIN: --Is now an ear jar.

1847
02:05:32,486 --> 02:05:34,168
TRAVIS: What happened? How'd they find you?

1848
02:05:34,168 --> 02:05:40,842
SAM: I don't know. They're very clever. I was
sneaking all the way down and they still

1849
02:05:40,842 --> 02:05:43,900
discovered me. I don't know how.

1850
02:05:43,900 --> 02:05:46,493
TALIESIN: We look at the rope connected to the
log.

1851
02:05:46,493 --> 02:05:52,139
MATT: Yeah, as Nott's saying this, your eyes wander
off of her over to the right where you see this

1852
02:05:52,139 --> 02:05:57,987
heavy tree covered in jagged bark that's
(creaking).

1853
02:05:57,987 --> 02:06:00,523
SAM: That happened after they discovered me.

1854
02:06:00,523 --> 02:06:01,543
TRAVIS: Right.

1855
02:06:01,543 --> 02:06:04,496
LAURA: Ooh, what are all these bags in here?

1856
02:06:04,496 --> 02:06:06,534
SAM: I was about to go through them, do you want
to help?

1857
02:06:06,534 --> 02:06:07,347
LAURA: Yeah!

1858
02:06:07,347 --> 02:06:13,475
TRAVIS: I will keep an eye down the tunnel that
they came from while they pillage.

1859
02:06:13,475 --> 02:06:15,813
MARISHA: I'll look around. Are there any other
entrances?

1860
02:06:15,813 --> 02:06:21,766
LIAM: As you're looking, I'm going to pull all the
Dancing Lights down to one and put the rag over it

1861
02:06:21,766 --> 02:06:24,057
and walk beside Beau so that she can see.

1862
02:06:24,057 --> 02:06:29,524
MATT: Okay. There are two shafts. Both seem to
descend. Both curving off in opposite directions.

1863
02:06:29,524 --> 02:06:33,247
They both have the wooden frame for support.

1864
02:06:33,247 --> 02:06:35,232
SAM: Wooden <i>shafts</i>.

1865
02:06:35,232 --> 02:06:44,705
LIAM: Come on, you people. We need a corner, and a
camera for the corner, and a long paper hat for

1866
02:06:44,705 --> 02:06:46,423
you to put you in the corner.

1867
02:06:46,423 --> 02:06:48,875
LAURA: I didn't even react to it, he had to point
it out.

1868
02:06:48,875 --> 02:06:56,036
MATT: Looking around, it looks like this was a
common area. This is the closest chamber to the

1869
02:06:56,036 --> 02:07:01,708
exterior of the mine. It looks like there were a
number of tables here, that a lot of them have

1870
02:07:01,708 --> 02:07:05,058
been knocked over and broken. A lot of what would
have filled this chamber has been pushed into the

1871
02:07:05,058 --> 02:07:11,576
barricade you saw up front. You're helming the
investigation? Go ahead and make an investigation check.

1872
02:07:11,576 --> 02:07:13,557
MARISHA: That was me. Me and Caleb.

1873
02:07:13,557 --> 02:07:16,225
MATT: You guys are looking down the shafts.
They're looking in the sacks.

1874
02:07:16,225 --> 02:07:17,487
MARISHA: Oh, sorry. For the bags, yeah.

1875
02:07:17,487 --> 02:07:21,672
MATT: Both of the shafts just descend and curve
out of view. They go to a steady 45-degree decline.

1876
02:07:21,672 --> 02:07:23,797
SAM: I'm helping, no? No.

1877
02:07:23,797 --> 02:07:25,182
LAURA: Do I get advantage because they're
helping?

1878
02:07:25,182 --> 02:07:26,334
MATT: You're too drunk to help.

1879
02:07:26,334 --> 02:07:27,518
TALIESIN: I was helping.

1880
02:07:27,518 --> 02:07:30,213
MATT: You're looking as well? Sure, take advantage
then.

1881
02:07:30,213 --> 02:07:36,311
LAURA: That is not as good. Investigation. 11.

1882
02:07:36,311 --> 02:07:44,014
MATT: 11? Okay. You glance around. You find
there's an untapped ale barrel, there's an

1883
02:07:44,014 --> 02:07:49,019
untapped water barrel, there's a hooded lantern
that still has a functional bit of oil in it,

1884
02:07:49,019 --> 02:07:54,958
though it's only about half-full and very rusted
over, but you clear off the glass on the outside

1885
02:07:54,958 --> 02:08:00,160
and it'll work fine. You find a sledgehammer that
the handle is not so rotted to the point where it

1886
02:08:00,160 --> 02:08:05,553
wouldn't be functional, but a fair sledgehammer if
you wanted to break any rock or stone. The crowbar

1887
02:08:05,553 --> 02:08:08,204
that you had seen earlier, that can be acquired.

1888
02:08:08,204 --> 02:08:09,963
LAURA: We should write this stuff down.

1889
02:08:09,963 --> 02:08:17,921
MATT: You find a small lightweight rod about that
long that has a short piece of waxed twine

1890
02:08:17,921 --> 02:08:19,564
hanging from one end.

1891
02:08:19,564 --> 02:08:25,329
LAURA: Is it metal, did you say?

1892
02:08:25,329 --> 02:08:28,388
MATT: No, it's not metal. It feels almost like a
hard clay.

1893
02:08:28,388 --> 02:08:30,728
LAURA: With wax?

1894
02:08:30,728 --> 02:08:33,125
MATT: With a waxed piece of twine on one end.

1895
02:08:33,125 --> 02:08:38,028
TALIESIN: Can I make a knowledge test to see if I
would know what this is?

1896
02:08:38,028 --> 02:08:40,534
SAM: A knowledge test? You mean an intelligence
check?

1897
02:08:40,534 --> 02:08:46,735
TALIESIN: Well, is this intelligence, or what
would this be? I'm trying to think-- I might have

1898
02:08:46,735 --> 02:08:48,393
come across this?

1899
02:08:48,393 --> 02:08:51,512
MATT: You had as good a chance as anybody to have
come across this, so if you want to make an

1900
02:08:51,512 --> 02:08:52,491
intelligence check.

1901
02:08:52,491 --> 02:08:57,919
TALIESIN: Just an intelligence check? I'm trying
to remember. 11?

1902
02:08:57,919 --> 02:08:59,950
MATT: You haven't come across one of these.

1903
02:08:59,950 --> 02:09:05,878
LAURA: Well, I have it. Then the water--

1904
02:09:05,878 --> 02:09:08,406
SAM: A water jug and an ale.

1905
02:09:08,406 --> 02:09:09,710
LAURA: A water jug and an ale jug.

1906
02:09:09,710 --> 02:09:11,193
SAM: Not jug, it was a barrel.

1907
02:09:11,193 --> 02:09:12,275
TRAVIS: Casks.

1908
02:09:12,275 --> 02:09:15,357
LAURA: Oh, so I can't carry that with me? They're
big?

1909
02:09:15,357 --> 02:09:16,867
MATT: No, they're big, heavy, filled things.

1910
02:09:16,867 --> 02:09:20,913
TALIESIN: We can put them aside. We will be
bringing them out of here.

1911
02:09:20,913 --> 02:09:22,886
MATT: You, make an intelligence check.

1912
02:09:22,886 --> 02:09:32,536
LIAM: Okay, that's okay. That's, Scheiße, where did it
go? Over here, D&amp;D Beyond. It is ten. Yeah, I

1913
02:09:32,536 --> 02:09:33,594
rolled very low.

1914
02:09:33,594 --> 02:09:34,939
MATT: Ten, okay.

1915
02:09:34,939 --> 02:09:37,813
TALIESIN: (whispering) Human, want a lantern?

1916
02:09:37,813 --> 02:09:44,846
MARISHA: Oh, yes. Did you light it? Is it a lit
lantern?

1917
02:09:44,846 --> 02:09:46,664
TALIESIN: I haven't lit it yet. You can light it,
I'll help.

1918
02:09:46,664 --> 02:09:48,507
LAURA: It's hooded, so you can close off the
light.

1919
02:09:48,507 --> 02:09:51,779
MARISHA: Oh, I can close it on and off, right?
Like one of those things?

1920
02:09:51,779 --> 02:09:55,367
MATT: Once it's ignited and the oil's lit, yeah,
you can open and close the hood.

1921
02:09:55,367 --> 02:09:57,094
TALIESIN: I'm one-handed, so I can't really help
you light it.

1922
02:09:57,094 --> 02:09:58,818
TRAVIS: Well, what've we got, are we happy?

1923
02:09:58,818 --> 02:10:04,375
LAURA: Yeah, I found a small rod and a crowbar and
a sledgehammer.

1924
02:10:04,375 --> 02:10:07,494
TRAVIS: Are you going to carry the sledgehammer?

1925
02:10:07,494 --> 02:10:08,849
LAURA: Is it heavy?

1926
02:10:08,849 --> 02:10:10,870
TRAVIS: Not for you, Beast Mode.

1927
02:10:10,870 --> 02:10:14,182
MATT: Nott, you're an alchemist.

1928
02:10:14,182 --> 02:10:18,955
LIAM: Does the rod look like crudely made or
prettily designed?

1929
02:10:18,955 --> 02:10:20,392
SAM: Apparently I'm looking it over.

1930
02:10:20,392 --> 02:10:26,062
MATT: Yeah, as you're looking over it, it's not
beautifully made, it looks functional like a lot

1931
02:10:26,062 --> 02:10:30,831
of the tools here, there isn't a lot of
presentation more than function as what you bring

1932
02:10:30,831 --> 02:10:32,160
into a mine.

1933
02:10:32,160 --> 02:10:35,292
LIAM: Okay, no carving, no glyphs, no nothing like
that, just caked in shit?

1934
02:10:35,292 --> 02:10:36,314
MATT: Yeah.

1935
02:10:36,314 --> 02:10:37,246
LIAM: Okay.

1936
02:10:37,246 --> 02:10:44,287
MATT: You take the rod and smell it and a familiar
scent hits your nose. You've worked in your

1937
02:10:44,287 --> 02:10:50,415
alchemical time with small-level explosives. As
part of the elements of the alchemist's fire,

1938
02:10:50,415 --> 02:10:56,226
there is a reagent catalyst that when the
chemicals mix it causes a minor explosion and then

1939
02:10:56,226 --> 02:11:01,329
burns heavily, there is an element of that, but
it's very, very strong and a very intense scent to

1940
02:11:01,329 --> 02:11:07,809
it. As soon as you smell it, it brings back
memories of accidents that have happened in the

1941
02:11:07,809 --> 02:11:16,266
past on a very small scale. You immediately get
this wave of cold shiver down your neck, that this

1942
02:11:16,266 --> 02:11:19,705
is a very dangerous object if used improperly.

1943
02:11:19,705 --> 02:11:30,657
SAM: Yeah, careful with that. I think maybe none
of us should hold that. Maybe Fjord, he seems sort

1944
02:11:30,657 --> 02:11:33,203
of responsible. No, don't make it a mustache.

1945
02:11:33,203 --> 02:11:34,858
(laughter)

1946
02:11:34,858 --> 02:11:42,821
SAM: It could blow up your face. It could blow up
your face. Yeah, it's a boom-boom stick. That's

1947
02:11:42,821 --> 02:11:44,725
the alchemical term.

1948
02:11:44,725 --> 02:11:46,348
LAURA: Oh shit.

1949
02:11:46,348 --> 02:11:55,456
SAM: I think if you put it near fire it could go
explode. Who wants to hold it... who is not Jester?

1950
02:11:55,456 --> 02:11:56,984
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll take it.

1951
02:11:56,984 --> 02:12:01,212
LAURA: Give me my pencil, though. No!

1952
02:12:01,212 --> 02:12:03,935
SAM: Oh great, throw a sharp object.

1953
02:12:03,935 --> 02:12:10,950
TALIESIN: Anyone watching at home, the physics was
really demanding on that one.

1954
02:12:10,950 --> 02:12:18,437
LAURA: Can I put the sledgehammer on my back?

1955
02:12:18,437 --> 02:12:20,940
MATT: Yeah. You can sling it in with your--

1956
02:12:20,940 --> 02:12:21,999
LAURA: My shield?

1957
02:12:21,999 --> 02:12:25,314
MARISHA: All right, guys, left tunnel or right
tunnel?

1958
02:12:25,314 --> 02:12:27,230
TRAVIS: I'll tuck the rod into my belt.

1959
02:12:27,230 --> 02:12:31,645
SAM: It's fine, I'll go down the tunnel and scope
it out for us.

1960
02:12:31,645 --> 02:12:36,641
TALIESIN: Well, before we do that, we should
remember to check for traps maybe.

1961
02:12:36,641 --> 02:12:37,648
SAM: Oh.

1962
02:12:37,648 --> 02:12:39,696
LAURA: Oh, can you do that?

1963
02:12:39,696 --> 02:12:40,920
SAM: I don't know.

1964
02:12:40,920 --> 02:12:42,148
TALIESIN: I certainly can't.

1965
02:12:42,148 --> 02:12:43,526
TRAVIS: You can?

1966
02:12:43,526 --> 02:12:45,637
TALIESIN: No, I can't. I can't do any of that.

1967
02:12:45,637 --> 02:12:46,765
LAURA: I can look for them.

1968
02:12:46,765 --> 02:12:47,907
TALIESIN: I won't be able to find them.

1969
02:12:47,907 --> 02:12:50,112
SAM: I can look for them too, I don't know what a
trap looks like.

1970
02:12:50,112 --> 02:12:52,983
LAURA: Well, what did that one look like that you got
hit with before?

1971
02:12:52,983 --> 02:12:55,262
SAM: Big piece of rope, probably should have seen
it.

1972
02:12:55,262 --> 02:12:57,949
LAURA: Maybe look for ropes crossing the ground.

1973
02:12:57,949 --> 02:12:59,344
SAM: All right.

1974
02:12:59,344 --> 02:13:07,096
TRAVIS: Maybe we view this an opportunity to grow and
we look for those now.

1975
02:13:07,096 --> 02:13:09,285
SAM: I will make a mental note.

1976
02:13:09,285 --> 02:13:10,132
TRAVIS: Great.

1977
02:13:10,132 --> 02:13:11,504
SAM: Look for big pieces of rope.

1978
02:13:11,504 --> 02:13:15,313
TRAVIS: Yeah. Anything that looks out of the
ordinary, out of place. On the wall, on the floors--

1979
02:13:15,313 --> 02:13:18,817
LIAM: Have a peeky-poo around as you go.

1980
02:13:18,817 --> 02:13:21,882
TRAVIS: Are you still shithoused? Are you fucking
hammered still?

1981
02:13:21,882 --> 02:13:23,872
SAM: Don't tell me what I can and can't drink.

1982
02:13:23,872 --> 02:13:26,935
(laughter)

1983
02:13:26,935 --> 02:13:31,752
LIAM: You know, she does this from time to time,
she becomes a little unpredictable, but you can't

1984
02:13:31,752 --> 02:13:33,846
argue with the results, you really cannot.

1985
02:13:33,846 --> 02:13:36,527
MARISHA: I kind of like her when she's like this.
It's good.

1986
02:13:36,527 --> 02:13:39,225
TRAVIS: Okay, she needs another shot.

1987
02:13:39,225 --> 02:13:41,470
SAM: You want me to go ahead again?

1988
02:13:41,470 --> 02:13:42,440
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1989
02:13:42,440 --> 02:13:43,390
SAM: Oh boy.

1990
02:13:43,390 --> 02:13:45,434
LAURA: Which one are we going down, though? There's
two entrances, aren't there?

1991
02:13:45,434 --> 02:13:46,802
MATT: There are two paths, yes.

1992
02:13:46,849 --> 02:13:50,457
SAM: I'll go down one, just a little ways, and then
I'll come back.

1993
02:13:50,457 --> 02:13:53,247
LAURA: You should actually stealth, though, this
time, okay?

1994
02:13:53,309 --> 02:13:54,867
SAM: I will stealth. I'm going to stealth.

1995
02:13:54,867 --> 02:13:56,015
LAURA: You have a blessing.

1996
02:13:56,015 --> 02:13:57,284
SAM: And search for traps.

1997
02:13:57,284 --> 02:13:58,991
MATT: Okay, so make a stealth check first.

1998
02:13:58,991 --> 02:14:00,078
LAURA: With advantage.

1999
02:14:00,078 --> 02:14:04,103
SAM: Oh good. Okay, 20-something.

2000
02:14:04,103 --> 02:14:06,976
MATT: Well, with advantage, but then disadvantage
from the drunk, so it's just a straight roll.

2001
02:14:07,041 --> 02:14:08,067
SAM: The first roll?

2002
02:14:08,067 --> 02:14:08,938
MATT: Yes.

2003
02:14:08,938 --> 02:14:09,735
SAM: 13.

2004
02:14:09,735 --> 02:14:11,863
MATT: Okay, good to know. Then you're going to
check for traps?

2005
02:14:11,863 --> 02:14:12,753
SAM: Yes.

2006
02:14:12,753 --> 02:14:16,394
MATT: Make an investigation check with
disadvantage.

2007
02:14:16,394 --> 02:14:18,094
SAM: With disadvantage?

2008
02:14:18,094 --> 02:14:19,632
MATT, LAURA, and LIAM: Because you're drunk.

2009
02:14:19,632 --> 02:14:22,012
SAM: That affects-- yeah.

2010
02:14:22,012 --> 02:14:27,296
LIAM: You can't tell me what I can do, Matthew.

2011
02:14:27,296 --> 02:14:30,745
MATT: Dexterity-based and intelligence-based
checks.

2012
02:14:30,745 --> 02:14:34,444
SAM: That's all of the checks. So zero.

2013
02:14:34,444 --> 02:14:36,076
MATT: Okay.

2014
02:14:36,076 --> 02:14:42,748
SAM: Oh wait, no! No, I did the math wrong, it's
ten. I'm drunk, guys!

2015
02:14:42,748 --> 02:14:45,436
TRAVIS: I know the feeling.

2016
02:14:45,436 --> 02:14:48,518
MATT: Okay, and which path is this you're
checking?

2017
02:14:48,518 --> 02:14:49,788
SAM: Left.

2018
02:14:49,788 --> 02:14:51,968
LAURA: I was going to say left. I knew.

2019
02:14:51,968 --> 02:14:53,159
SAM: I love you.

2020
02:14:53,159 --> 02:14:55,878
TRAVIS: Do you want to check air current
temperature? Nothing? Anything?

2021
02:14:55,878 --> 02:14:58,142
MARISHA: Yeah, little drafts, anything like that?

2022
02:14:58,142 --> 02:15:02,679
MATT: You don't sense any draft, the air is pretty
stagnant, actually.

2023
02:15:02,679 --> 02:15:04,416
TRAVIS: Temperature equal on both sides?

2024
02:15:04,416 --> 02:15:12,484
MATT: Seems to be. On the left path, you do not
notice any traps, anything akin to what you

2025
02:15:12,484 --> 02:15:20,531
stumbled across as you entered. It does seem to
descend and curve out of the way, but begin to

2026
02:15:20,531 --> 02:15:26,190
snake a bit. You get about 15 to 20 feet down
before it begins to rapidly curve left and right,

2027
02:15:26,190 --> 02:15:30,379
it's only about ten feet wide. You can continue if
you want.

2028
02:15:30,379 --> 02:15:34,825
SAM: No thanks. Okay, I'll go back and report what
I've heard, or what I've learned.

2029
02:15:34,825 --> 02:15:39,146
LAURA: Do either of the two paths have more tracks
coming in and out of them?

2030
02:15:39,146 --> 02:15:45,605
MATT: They both seem fairly equal. You've been
keeping tabs on footfalls in here. There's traffic

2031
02:15:45,605 --> 02:15:46,799
both ways.

2032
02:15:46,799 --> 02:15:50,858
TRAVIS: You know what could be really handy in
this situation is some of that fancy fucking

2033
02:15:50,858 --> 02:15:52,209
thread of yours.

2034
02:15:52,209 --> 02:15:56,774
LIAM: For keeping things-- alerting us of things
coming here or--

2035
02:15:56,774 --> 02:15:59,820
TRAVIS: Yeah, I don't mind commiting to one of
these tunnels, I just want to make sure nothing

2036
02:15:59,820 --> 02:16:01,978
comes behind us or comes up from the other way.

2037
02:16:01,978 --> 02:16:07,248
LIAM: Yeah, that's a good suggestion. First, what
are we doing? What did you find out down that way?

2038
02:16:07,248 --> 02:16:11,606
SAM: It just keeps going and starts snaking, and
there's no traps, though.

2039
02:16:11,606 --> 02:16:14,675
LAURA: Let's go down the right one.

2040
02:16:14,797 --> 02:16:15,498
SAM: Why?

2041
02:16:15,498 --> 02:16:18,513
LIAM: I think we should also send you down that
one as well to have a look around.

2042
02:16:18,513 --> 02:16:21,561
SAM: All right. Here I go.

2043
02:16:21,561 --> 02:16:23,310
(laughter)

2044
02:16:23,310 --> 02:16:27,527
MATT: Make a stealth check, please.

2045
02:16:27,527 --> 02:16:29,825
SAM: Okay, and looking for traps. Stealth with--

2046
02:16:29,825 --> 02:16:30,913
MATT: Disadvantage.

2047
02:16:30,913 --> 02:16:31,640
LAURA: No.

2048
02:16:31,640 --> 02:16:32,919
MATT: Oh, it's straight roll because--

2049
02:16:32,919 --> 02:16:35,305
SAM: Okay, 25. 24. Something. It's a lot.

2050
02:16:35,305 --> 02:16:36,827
MATT: All right, and investigation check with
disadvantage.

2051
02:16:36,827 --> 02:16:38,427
SAM: Investigation is 13.

2052
02:16:38,427 --> 02:16:39,685
MATT: With disadvantage.

2053
02:16:39,685 --> 02:16:40,908
TRAVIS: Because you're hammered.

2054
02:16:40,908 --> 02:16:42,782
SAM: Yeah. 13.

2055
02:16:42,782 --> 02:16:44,115
TRAVIS: Yes!

2056
02:16:44,115 --> 02:16:51,711
MATT: You begin to curve down the right path and
there is a slight depression on one side that you

2057
02:16:51,711 --> 02:16:56,378
glance over and look and it looks like some of the
burlap that had been torn from the sacks earlier in the

2058
02:16:56,378 --> 02:17:02,872
tunnel had been used to cover a three and a
half foot wide pit that has been laced over to

2059
02:17:02,872 --> 02:17:05,677
hide its presence.

2060
02:17:05,677 --> 02:17:09,476
SAM: It's just burlap over a pit in the ground?

2061
02:17:09,476 --> 02:17:13,262
MATT: Yeah, it's affixed with a couple of rocks in
the sides, it's very light and would have fallen

2062
02:17:13,262 --> 02:17:19,678
through. It only covers part of the path. The
tunnel is about ten feet wide and the right side

2063
02:17:19,678 --> 02:17:26,820
of it is where that pitfall is. You notice it and
go. "Oh, hmm." This one does not snake, this one

2064
02:17:26,820 --> 02:17:34,398
continues in a continual curve for another 40 or
so feet before you're starting to get a little far

2065
02:17:34,398 --> 02:17:36,529
from your friends. You can continue if you want.

2066
02:17:36,570 --> 02:17:38,006
SAM: It just keeps curving and curving?

2067
02:17:38,006 --> 02:17:40,372
MATT: It looks like it's going in a downward
spiral.

2068
02:17:40,372 --> 02:17:43,233
SAM: Oh, a downward spiral. Okay, I'll go back and
report what I saw.

2069
02:17:43,233 --> 02:17:44,608
MATT: Great album.

2070
02:17:44,608 --> 02:17:45,871
TALIESIN: So true.

2071
02:17:45,871 --> 02:17:51,813
SAM: All right, so one path goes "wiggedy woo" and
the other path goes "zibbidy zow."

2072
02:17:51,813 --> 02:17:54,691
TALIESIN: Were there any traps?

2073
02:17:54,691 --> 02:18:06,795
SAM: No traps. Oh yes, there was a trap! To be
fair, there was one trap. I thought you meant any

2074
02:18:06,795 --> 02:18:09,493
sprung traps. There was a trap.

2075
02:18:09,493 --> 02:18:12,696
TRAVIS: You sussed it out.

2076
02:18:12,696 --> 02:18:14,562
SAM: I sussed it out. Don't worry, I'll take care
of it.

2077
02:18:14,562 --> 02:18:16,698
LIAM: How far down did you go each way?

2078
02:18:16,698 --> 02:18:23,788
SAM: 40 feet down the "ziggedy zow" and like 25
feet down the "zibbidy zoo."

2079
02:18:23,788 --> 02:18:30,491
LIAM: Well, my instinct tells me that if there's
something there, that they would trap it so

2080
02:18:30,491 --> 02:18:37,376
probably more valuable, if we're going on nothing,
take the path that is trapped.

2081
02:18:37,376 --> 02:18:38,380
LAURA: I agree.

2082
02:18:38,380 --> 02:18:39,427
TALIESIN: Hear, hear.

2083
02:18:39,427 --> 02:18:40,782
SAM: You're so smart.

2084
02:18:40,782 --> 02:18:44,433
LAURA: Unless they want us to think it's the path
that they've trapped.

2085
02:18:44,433 --> 02:18:46,009
SAM: Reverse psychology!

2086
02:18:46,009 --> 02:18:49,037
LAURA: That's right, and it's actually the path
that is least resistance.

2087
02:18:49,037 --> 02:18:51,401
TALIESIN: Unless they knew that you would think
that.

2088
02:18:51,401 --> 02:18:54,412
SAM: Oh, reverse reverse psychology!

2089
02:18:54,412 --> 02:19:01,489
LIAM: These are dog people? Let's take the path
with the trap.

2090
02:19:01,489 --> 02:19:02,777
TALIESIN: Trap, trap.

2091
02:19:02,777 --> 02:19:04,090
SAM: Right path.

2092
02:19:04,090 --> 02:19:07,766
MATT: As you all slowly begin to descend down the
right path.

2093
02:19:07,766 --> 02:19:09,351
LAURA: We're stealthing!

2094
02:19:09,351 --> 02:19:12,507
MATT: We'll come to that in just a second. We're
going to go ahead and take a break. Since it's a little

2095
02:19:12,599 --> 02:19:19,837
past nine. We'll be back here in a few minutes to
pick up the descent further into this mineshaft.

2096
02:19:19,837 --> 02:19:21,311
LAURA and MATT: Into madness.

2097
02:19:21,311 --> 02:19:22,847
LIAM: Down the wooden shaft.

2098
02:19:22,847 --> 02:19:27,054
MATT: Before we get to that, however, we do have a
giveaway from our friends at Wyrmwood, as you saw

2099
02:19:27,054 --> 02:19:32,017
last week we have another of their black walnut,
two of their Adventurer Arsenals to give away again

2100
02:19:32,017 --> 02:19:36,158
this week. If you haven't seen, they're awesome,
well-made, and if you open it up on the inside it

2101
02:19:36,158 --> 02:19:40,754
has space for you dice, for your pen, a place
for a mini or eraser or anything else you want to

2102
02:19:40,811 --> 02:19:46,506
carry into your game. It fits into the dice box
that comes with it as well. We're giving away two

2103
02:19:46,506 --> 02:19:51,919
of these during the break. To enter this while
we're gone at the break you can go into the Twitch

2104
02:19:51,981 --> 02:19:58,817
chat and enter, when you're prompted, the code word
gnoll. That's G-N-O-L-L. Do not enter it more than

2105
02:19:58,862 --> 02:20:02,507
once or you'll be disqualified, and we'll come
back from the break with two winners to this.

2106
02:20:02,507 --> 02:20:04,803
Thank you so much. We'll see you guys here in a
minute.

2107
02:20:04,866 --> 02:33:46,954
[break]

2108
02:33:46,954 --> 02:33:53,249
MATT: Welcome back. We have our two winners in the
chat over the break. Congratulations on winning

2109
02:33:53,249 --> 02:33:59,484
the Wyrmwood package to ding0atx and
lunaimperial.

2110
02:33:59,484 --> 02:34:01,136
ALL: Woo!

2111
02:34:01,136 --> 02:34:03,819
MATT: Congratulations to the two of you guys.
Danoba will reach out to you and get your contact

2112
02:34:03,819 --> 02:34:08,103
information and we'll get those sent to you ASAP,
so well done.

2113
02:34:08,103 --> 02:34:13,857
Yes, all right. You chose the right or the
left again?

2114
02:34:13,857 --> 02:34:15,140
SAM and LAURA: The right.

2115
02:34:15,140 --> 02:34:31,975
MATT: The right, okay. Down the path, the shaft
winds for about another 150 or so feet before it

2116
02:34:31,975 --> 02:34:44,261
slowly levels out into a long chamber of multiple
levels. What once looked like a solid mining vein

2117
02:34:44,261 --> 02:34:53,932
is now strewn with bones and flayed skin pinned to
the rock walls with scavenged nails, blood

2118
02:34:53,932 --> 02:35:01,457
spattered across them with intent painted a jagged
smile of sharp teeth on each of these four hides.

2119
02:35:01,457 --> 02:35:11,465
A faint source of light in the center flickers, a
small stone altar holding a cluster of candles in

2120
02:35:11,465 --> 02:35:20,494
the central level platform. It looks like about
six gnoll-like figures have gathered around this stone--

2121
02:35:20,494 --> 02:35:22,010
LAURA: We were stealthing, we were stealthing.

2122
02:35:22,010 --> 02:35:24,186
MATT: I know. We're going to get to that in just a
second.

2123
02:35:24,186 --> 02:35:25,303
LAURA: Okay.

2124
02:35:25,303 --> 02:35:33,106
MATT: While a strange seventh figure places small
wet stones upon this altar, smaller than the other

2125
02:35:33,106 --> 02:35:38,999
gnolls. Let's get a perception check real fast
from two of you. Who's leading the--

2126
02:35:38,999 --> 02:35:43,477
SAM: I would have been bringing them down, right?

2127
02:35:43,477 --> 02:35:44,885
LIAM: You can see in the dark.

2128
02:35:44,885 --> 02:35:46,686
LAURA: Yeah, I can see in the dark, I'll look.

2129
02:35:46,686 --> 02:35:50,754
MATT: We'll say since you two would be in the
front then for that, you jumped up first.

2130
02:35:50,754 --> 02:35:53,680
Perception check, both of you.

2131
02:35:53,680 --> 02:35:55,225
SAM: Five.

2132
02:35:55,225 --> 02:35:56,325
MARISHA: This sucks.

2133
02:35:56,325 --> 02:35:57,322
LAURA: 11.

2134
02:35:57,322 --> 02:36:03,897
MATT: Okay, so you don't see much of the figure.
Also, right now, I'll have you guys all do a

2135
02:36:03,897 --> 02:36:05,696
stealth check, please, as you make your way down.

2136
02:36:05,696 --> 02:36:06,816
TALIESIN: Do I still have advantage?

2137
02:36:06,816 --> 02:36:08,534
LAURA: No, he has advantage now, sorry.

2138
02:36:08,534 --> 02:36:09,930
TALIESIN: That's okay.

2139
02:36:09,930 --> 02:36:10,933
SAM: 22.

2140
02:36:10,933 --> 02:36:13,604
LAURA: 15.

2141
02:36:13,604 --> 02:36:14,766
TALIESIN: Nine.

2142
02:36:14,766 --> 02:36:15,666
LIAM: Ten.

2143
02:36:15,666 --> 02:36:16,766
MARISHA: 22.

2144
02:36:16,766 --> 02:36:17,583
TRAVIS: 15.

2145
02:36:17,583 --> 02:36:18,857
MATT: Okay.

2146
02:36:18,857 --> 02:36:21,397
LAURA: Oh no.

2147
02:36:21,397 --> 02:36:29,712
SAM: Looks like this is the wrong path, everyone.
We should probably go back to the other. Sorry.

2148
02:36:29,712 --> 02:36:42,623
MATT: This figure looks gnoll-like, you see the
ears and the snout, but as it reaches down and

2149
02:36:42,623 --> 02:36:49,557
picks up these wet stones and places them in the
altar, giving small, dark, muffled barks and

2150
02:36:49,557 --> 02:36:58,390
yipping sounds, you see elements that look like
smooth human flesh. The more that you focus in,

2151
02:36:58,390 --> 02:37:03,806
you can see this looks to be a humanoid figure
that is wearing pieces of hollowed-out gnoll-like

2152
02:37:03,806 --> 02:37:10,614
armor. A hood missing a jaw that's placed over the
top of the head, sections of arms worn like a

2153
02:37:10,614 --> 02:37:18,801
glove with the hand missing, sifted through. It
seems that a lot of the body parts are discolored

2154
02:37:18,801 --> 02:37:24,879
and rotting a bit, from what you can see from the
candle light that's flickering across it. Long

2155
02:37:24,937 --> 02:37:30,702
bonelike spines, similar to what adorned the armor
of that pack lord that you battled in the middle

2156
02:37:30,702 --> 02:37:36,088
of the city last night, are also affixed to the
outsides and pierced through elements of the

2157
02:37:36,088 --> 02:37:43,662
shoulders and head of this flesh gnoll hide that
it's wearing. As it growls, mimicking the sounds

2158
02:37:43,709 --> 02:37:50,440
of the gnolls that it seems to be residing along,
the other gnolls around look, pacing from foot to

2159
02:37:50,440 --> 02:37:56,710
foot impatiently (growls and grunts). Begins to
speak louder and louder at this altar as it places a

2160
02:37:56,710 --> 02:38:07,690
final wet stone on it. All the remaining gnolls
begin to bark in unison together (bark and howl).

2161
02:38:07,690 --> 02:38:09,511
LAURA: (whisper) Should we stop this?

2162
02:38:09,511 --> 02:38:13,809
MATT: They all at once leap onto the altar and
begin tearing into the stones, which are not

2163
02:38:13,809 --> 02:38:21,512
stones. They were glistening. At this point you see
hearts that are now being torn and swallowed by

2164
02:38:21,512 --> 02:38:23,617
the gnolls at the altar.

2165
02:38:23,617 --> 02:38:27,576
LAURA: Should we kill them all?

2166
02:38:27,576 --> 02:38:29,966
SAM: No.

2167
02:38:29,966 --> 02:38:33,282
TRAVIS: Don't make a sound.

2168
02:38:33,282 --> 02:38:36,059
LIAM: (vomiting)

2169
02:38:36,059 --> 02:38:39,305
MARISHA: Oh, that was well done.

2170
02:38:39,305 --> 02:38:46,730
MATT: They finish devouring the hearts and the
humanoid figure begins to bark a few more times

2171
02:38:46,730 --> 02:39:06,644
and then in broken Common says, "The hunger will be
fed: ours and hers. Come," and points to two of

2172
02:39:06,644 --> 02:39:19,474
them, "Help me carry more meat below. The rest,
stay. Feast on what remains." Turns around and you

2173
02:39:19,474 --> 02:39:24,484
now look across the way. On the other side of the
chamber, darkened, you see a gnoll leaning in

2174
02:39:24,484 --> 02:39:32,539
familiar armor: the one that you had battled and
had left with the carts is watching from the

2175
02:39:32,539 --> 02:39:37,527
far end of the chamber down on the lower third-level
platform.

2176
02:39:37,591 --> 02:39:41,542
LAURA: The big mama jama?

2177
02:39:41,542 --> 02:39:45,067
MATT: The weird gnoll priest, I guess you could
say at this point, that's been helming this little

2178
02:39:45,067 --> 02:39:53,437
ritual, goes and joins the armored gnolls and steps
aside and follows second, and the two gnolls that

2179
02:39:53,437 --> 02:39:58,581
were assigned by it leave as well, leaving four in
there in the chamber currently.

2180
02:39:58,581 --> 02:40:01,143
SAM: Including the armored one or no?

2181
02:40:01,143 --> 02:40:02,665
MATT: No, the armored one leaves with the priest.

2182
02:40:02,665 --> 02:40:06,301
LIAM: Did you describe any light source in here
that they're working by?

2183
02:40:06,301 --> 02:40:13,915
MATT: The candle altar. Yeah. It's not an
extremely bright light, but for those of you who

2184
02:40:13,915 --> 02:40:18,412
are human, it's enough where you can make out
shapes once your eyes have adjusted to the low

2185
02:40:18,412 --> 02:40:19,619
light interior.

2186
02:40:19,619 --> 02:40:20,819
LIAM: Got it.

2187
02:40:20,819 --> 02:40:27,945
MATT: You watch as they begin to grab the bodies
on the ground. You can see there are now-- The

2188
02:40:27,945 --> 02:40:33,628
grinding of bones as they drag broken corpses
across the floor and begin to tear into the torsos.

2189
02:40:33,628 --> 02:40:42,663
LAURA: While that's happening, I'm going to cast,
very quietly, Cure Wounds on Nott next to me,

2190
02:40:42,663 --> 02:40:45,919
because I saw you're bleeding, yo.

2191
02:40:45,919 --> 02:40:50,657
SAM: Oh, sorry. What does that do?

2192
02:40:50,657 --> 02:40:54,349
LAURA: You just regained nine hit points.

2193
02:40:54,349 --> 02:40:55,612
SAM: Ooh, nine.

2194
02:40:55,612 --> 02:40:58,435
TALIESIN: This is getting ridiculous.

2195
02:40:58,435 --> 02:41:02,952
LAURA: Yay.

2196
02:41:02,952 --> 02:41:15,017
MATT: (barking) You watch as four hyenas fill into
the space where the gnolls are and begin to sit at

2197
02:41:15,017 --> 02:41:19,528
bay, waiting for the gnolls to finish feasting. One
of them gets close, and the gnoll just grabs its

2198
02:41:19,528 --> 02:41:26,349
head and shoves it against the wall, and it snaps
into the wall and then backs up and then waits its

2199
02:41:26,349 --> 02:41:32,186
turn. You can see the other hyenas that exist in
this space, naturally scavengers, have to wait,

2200
02:41:32,186 --> 02:41:35,367
being at the lowest of the totem pole.

2201
02:41:35,367 --> 02:41:36,832
TRAVIS: How many total?

2202
02:41:36,832 --> 02:41:39,146
MATT: Four gnolls, four hyenas.

2203
02:41:39,146 --> 02:41:40,517
MARISHA: Fuck.

2204
02:41:40,517 --> 02:41:43,858
LIAM: The one that got thrown into the wall? It
got stunned or hurt, it didn't get any--

2205
02:41:43,858 --> 02:41:46,780
MATT: It didn't seem to be too much. More to just
keep it away from the meal.

2206
02:41:46,780 --> 02:41:49,512
TALIESIN: We know they go down very quickly.

2207
02:41:49,512 --> 02:41:53,015
MARISHA: I'm afraid if we keep waiting, more will
just show up.

2208
02:41:53,015 --> 02:41:55,331
LAURA: Yeah. Let's kill them!

2209
02:41:55,331 --> 02:41:57,384
LIAM: (whispering) Here we go.

2210
02:41:57,384 --> 02:42:00,053
SAM: What? We're just going to go? There's no
plan?

2211
02:42:00,053 --> 02:42:05,537
MARISHA: Well, maybe we can draw a few over to us
and take them out on our terms.

2212
02:42:05,537 --> 02:42:09,640
MATT: If you're planning to engage, should I show
you the layout of where they're placed?

2213
02:42:09,640 --> 02:42:11,708
ALL: Yes!

2214
02:42:11,708 --> 02:42:19,634
SAM: He says coyly. "Would you like to see the
layout of the room?"

2215
02:42:19,634 --> 02:42:22,473
TRAVIS: I don't like seven on eight. I am not a
fan.

2216
02:42:22,473 --> 02:42:23,725
SAM: Seven?

2217
02:42:23,725 --> 02:42:24,727
LAURA: But they're little.

2218
02:42:24,727 --> 02:42:25,696
SAM: Six.

2219
02:42:25,696 --> 02:42:26,823
LAURA: The hyenas are little.

2220
02:42:26,823 --> 02:42:27,933
SAM: Oh, Yasha's with us, right?

2221
02:42:27,933 --> 02:42:29,656
(laughing)

2222
02:42:29,656 --> 02:42:31,146
LIAM: The hyenas are just doggos.

2223
02:42:31,146 --> 02:42:36,698
SAM: Yeah, they've got like four hit points. You
can take out two of them in one go. If you were,

2224
02:42:36,698 --> 02:42:38,086
you know, Grog.

2225
02:42:38,086 --> 02:42:42,924
MATT: So here we have--

2226
02:42:42,924 --> 02:42:47,053
LAURA: Oh, one's an archer, two's an archer,
three's an archer.

2227
02:42:47,053 --> 02:42:49,441
MATT: They all tend to carry a bow on their
backs.

2228
02:42:49,441 --> 02:42:50,715
LAURA: Shit, four's an archer.

2229
02:42:50,715 --> 02:42:54,021
MATT: You can see now the hyenas that are waiting
patiently. This one got knocked into the wall.

2230
02:42:54,021 --> 02:43:00,917
They're scooting at the sides, waiting for them to
finish their meals. You guys are right up here

2231
02:43:00,917 --> 02:43:05,817
where the shaft opens, glancing down into this
chamber. That was where the priest and the other

2232
02:43:05,817 --> 02:43:07,453
gnolls had exited.

2233
02:43:07,453 --> 02:43:12,637
SAM: We're up on top, up there?

2234
02:43:12,637 --> 02:43:15,440
MATT: You guys are up on here. Which, for the
purposes of--

2235
02:43:15,440 --> 02:43:18,091
TRAVIS: Good thing we're metal.

2236
02:43:18,091 --> 02:43:19,300
MATT: It's fine.

2237
02:43:19,300 --> 02:43:26,410
TRAVIS: I mean, I hate it, but--

2238
02:43:26,410 --> 02:43:32,922
SAM: Is there any way to even the playing field a
bit? Any strategy? Fjord and Caleb, come on?

2239
02:43:32,922 --> 02:43:36,856
LIAM: What about the boom stick that you have? We
can chuck it into the--

2240
02:43:36,856 --> 02:43:39,048
LAURA: Oh! Wouldn't that be really loud? Wouldn't
that draw them back, though?

2241
02:43:39,048 --> 02:43:40,434
LIAM: Yes, it would, but--

2242
02:43:40,434 --> 02:43:41,827
TRAVIS: Plus we're in a mine.

2243
02:43:41,827 --> 02:43:43,732
LAURA: It might bring the whole thing down on us.

2244
02:43:43,732 --> 02:43:45,772
SAM: Maybe we could use that to escape later.

2245
02:43:45,772 --> 02:43:47,181
LAURA: Yeah, definitely.

2246
02:43:47,181 --> 02:43:48,738
TRAVIS: There's a big column that's in between
them, right?

2247
02:43:48,738 --> 02:43:49,925
MATT: Correct.

2248
02:43:49,925 --> 02:43:51,627
TRAVIS: Is it a column or a stalagmite?

2249
02:43:51,627 --> 02:43:58,365
MATT: It looks like it was a stalactite that then
was reinforced as a column to help

2250
02:43:58,427 --> 02:44:02,099
maintain the structure.

2251
02:44:02,099 --> 02:44:07,577
MARISHA: If we can make some sort of distraction,
to get their attention, and if we can put or

2252
02:44:07,577 --> 02:44:15,307
heavy hitters, our people up front, we can try and
hold them in this mouth, ranged people in the back.

2253
02:44:15,307 --> 02:44:19,473
TRAVIS: Do you want to throw the rod at the
column?

2254
02:44:19,473 --> 02:44:25,277
LAURA: I feel like we should do that when we're
leaving. We shouldn't do that before we go in.

2255
02:44:25,277 --> 02:44:27,196
Because we're not going to be able to get to
anything.

2256
02:44:27,196 --> 02:44:29,098
TRAVIS: There's another path down.

2257
02:44:29,098 --> 02:44:33,267
LAURA: Well yeah, but this is very loud. It would
draw things up here.

2258
02:44:33,267 --> 02:44:40,437
LIAM: Where would you want this distraction to be?
Because I can make a little--

2259
02:44:40,437 --> 02:44:45,084
TRAVIS: Behind them, and make them turn away from
us. Because we're in a fatal funnel up here at the top.

2260
02:44:45,084 --> 02:44:51,342
LIAM: I can make a little dancing golden person of
light appear down at the bottom of the passage.

2261
02:44:51,342 --> 02:44:55,324
MATT: A fifth gnoll begins to wander its way into the
chamber.

2262
02:44:55,324 --> 02:44:57,080
MARISHA: You see, more are going to keep coming.

2263
02:44:57,080 --> 02:45:04,522
MATT: It goes over and kicks one of the hyenas off
to the side. It sits there (snuffling and whining).

2264
02:45:04,522 --> 02:45:06,993
TALIESIN: We can see now or try the other way.

2265
02:45:06,993 --> 02:45:09,839
LIAM: If there's more in there, they're just going
to come in here anyway.

2266
02:45:09,839 --> 02:45:11,348
BEAU: And it's not confined.

2267
02:45:11,348 --> 02:45:13,068
TRAVIS: I genuinely feel like we should go the
other way.

2268
02:45:13,068 --> 02:45:16,264
SAM: The other way? This is it, this is the other
way.

2269
02:45:16,264 --> 02:45:17,972
TRAVIS: There's a whole other path.

2270
02:45:17,972 --> 02:45:19,420
SAM: It's nothing.

2271
02:45:19,420 --> 02:45:20,378
TRAVIS: No?

2272
02:45:20,378 --> 02:45:21,457
SAM: That's nothing.

2273
02:45:21,457 --> 02:45:22,866
TRAVIS: Do you know?

2274
02:45:22,866 --> 02:45:24,398
SAM: No, I'm guessing.

2275
02:45:24,398 --> 02:45:28,210
LIAM: Here's the question: do you think these
things are going to come out of here right away,

2276
02:45:28,210 --> 02:45:34,078
or is it worth a shot? Maybe there is a way
around, to a way they're not expecting?

2277
02:45:34,078 --> 02:45:41,196
MARISHA: Normally, miners build coal mines with
connecting shafts and double exits in case one

2278
02:45:41,196 --> 02:45:47,113
side collapses. You always want another way out.
We just don't know where they've put everybody.

2279
02:45:47,113 --> 02:45:49,032
We're here looking for villagers, remember?

2280
02:45:49,032 --> 02:45:53,071
LIAM: You know, there's nothing saying we have to
run in here if we're not feeling this. We can

2281
02:45:53,071 --> 02:45:57,513
backtrack and look in the other direction. In
fact, I'm leaning that way.

2282
02:45:57,513 --> 02:46:06,501
MARISHA: Hey, Matt. DM question? If we were to try
and back out of here, and draw them towards us,

2283
02:46:06,501 --> 02:46:08,752
what would that be? Just a tunnel?

2284
02:46:08,752 --> 02:46:13,852
MATT: Yeah, this tunnel is a ten-foot wide tunnel
that continues backward.

2285
02:46:13,852 --> 02:46:16,768
LIAM: Plus we do have a map here.

2286
02:46:16,768 --> 02:46:25,376
SAM: Five gnolls. We've got these guys.

2287
02:46:25,376 --> 02:46:30,940
LAURA: We can try attacking them, and if it gets
bad, then we use the TNT.

2288
02:46:30,940 --> 02:46:33,116
LIAM: Use D&amp;D?

2289
02:46:33,116 --> 02:46:34,476
MARISHA: Yeah, that's what I heard.

2290
02:46:34,476 --> 02:46:35,513
SAM: D&amp;D?

2291
02:46:35,513 --> 02:46:37,056
LAURA: No, TNT.

2292
02:46:37,056 --> 02:46:38,400
TALIESIN: The longer we wait, the more things are
coming.

2293
02:46:38,400 --> 02:46:41,131
SAM: Maybe it's the whiskey talking, but I think
we've got these guys.

2294
02:46:41,131 --> 02:46:52,859
MATT: If you wanted to, turning you backward here,
there's this path here. We could continue the

2295
02:46:52,859 --> 02:46:54,634
tunnel back this way.

2296
02:46:54,634 --> 02:47:00,864
MARISHA: It's only a death funnel if we're the
ones dying, right? If they're dying, that's good

2297
02:47:00,864 --> 02:47:02,437
for us.

2298
02:47:02,437 --> 02:47:09,154
SAM: How far is it on the map from where we're
standing to the farthest gnoll?

2299
02:47:09,154 --> 02:47:15,091
MATT: The farthest gnoll there? About 60 or so
feet.

2300
02:47:15,091 --> 02:47:23,354
SAM: We can definitely do a distraction to get
some of them to turn away from us. At least we get

2301
02:47:23,422 --> 02:47:24,756
a round in.

2302
02:47:24,756 --> 02:47:26,413
LAURA: Get a surprise round.

2303
02:47:26,413 --> 02:47:29,263
LIAM: I can make a little golden person dance
behind that guy there.

2304
02:47:29,263 --> 02:47:31,599
LAURA: We can get a surprise round on all of
them.

2305
02:47:31,599 --> 02:47:35,140
MARISHA: Surprise round, get as many range and AoE
spells off as we can?

2306
02:47:35,140 --> 02:47:37,928
LIAM: AoE? Surprise round? What are you talking
about?

2307
02:47:37,928 --> 02:47:40,249
TALIESIN: Be helpful!

2308
02:47:40,249 --> 02:47:48,165
TRAVIS: Can I use this planning moment to cast
Armor of Agathys on myself?

2309
02:47:48,165 --> 02:47:49,428
MATT: You may.

2310
02:47:49,428 --> 02:47:54,004
TRAVIS: Spectral frost collects from the air on my
armor.

2311
02:47:54,004 --> 02:47:58,636
MATT: Which, as a note to remind you from last
time--

2312
02:47:58,636 --> 02:48:02,396
TRAVIS: I didn't give myself enough cold damage.

2313
02:48:02,396 --> 02:48:03,863
MATT: Correct, yeah, so keep that in mind.

2314
02:48:03,863 --> 02:48:09,365
SAM: Okay. Are you going to try your thing or
should I try my thing first?

2315
02:48:09,365 --> 02:48:10,606
LIAM: What is your thing?

2316
02:48:10,606 --> 02:48:17,494
SAM: I don't know. I can try something! I can do a
similar thing, have them see something behind

2317
02:48:17,494 --> 02:48:21,692
them, but you can do the same thing. Yours are
already cast, right?

2318
02:48:21,692 --> 02:48:26,225
LIAM: Not right now, no. But it's like that
(snaps), it's easy, this one.

2319
02:48:26,225 --> 02:48:33,269
SAM: Okay. I could try to get one of them to fight
with one of the other ones of them.

2320
02:48:33,269 --> 02:48:35,401
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah, that's good.

2321
02:48:35,401 --> 02:48:36,444
LIAM: Do that.

2322
02:48:36,444 --> 02:48:42,210
SAM: I'm going to sneak up, down the steps to that
little crook in there.

2323
02:48:42,210 --> 02:48:43,533
MATT: Right here?

2324
02:48:43,533 --> 02:48:48,989
SAM: Little further back, yeah. Is that all right?
Do I have to roll or anything?

2325
02:48:48,989 --> 02:48:50,266
MATT: Roll a stealth check.

2326
02:48:50,266 --> 02:48:53,409
SAM: Oh, shit. Okay, with disadvantage?

2327
02:48:53,409 --> 02:48:55,131
MATT: Do you still have the gift?

2328
02:48:55,131 --> 02:48:56,398
LAURA: No, you still have Blessing.

2329
02:48:56,398 --> 02:49:00,633
SAM: Oh, so 26. That puts me within 30 feet of
those guys, right?

2330
02:49:00,633 --> 02:49:01,652
MATT: Oh yeah.

2331
02:49:01,652 --> 02:49:03,913
SAM: And what are they doing? Eating hearts?

2332
02:49:03,913 --> 02:49:11,352
MATT: At a closer glance, you look and see. One of
them currently is holding a pair of legs that are

2333
02:49:11,352 --> 02:49:19,987
no longer attached to a torso, and is stripping
the flesh from the thigh and leg, tearing into it.

2334
02:49:19,987 --> 02:49:25,009
Takes a piece and chucks it off to the side, and
the two hyenas fight over it. Another one back

2335
02:49:25,009 --> 02:49:33,202
there, you can see, is clutching a scapula, the
back of a shoulder blade, and is breaking the

2336
02:49:33,202 --> 02:49:40,895
bones in half and sucking the marrow out. At a
quick glance, you get the sense that some of these

2337
02:49:40,895 --> 02:49:44,374
may have been denizens of Alfield as of 24 hours
ago.

2338
02:49:44,374 --> 02:49:48,822
LIAM: I'm going to start throwing up again soon,
so let's either do this or backtrack, please.

2339
02:49:48,822 --> 02:49:54,151
SAM: Are they carrying anything on their bodies,
on their person? Anything, canteens or weapons or

2340
02:49:54,151 --> 02:49:55,539
equipment or anything?

2341
02:49:55,539 --> 02:49:56,582
MATT: The gnolls?

2342
02:49:56,582 --> 02:49:57,337
SAM: The gnolls.

2343
02:49:57,337 --> 02:50:03,686
MATT: Most of them have a longbow slung over their
shoulder, and have a spear that dangles off to the

2344
02:50:03,686 --> 02:50:05,427
side, or has been jammed in the ground next to
them.

2345
02:50:05,427 --> 02:50:14,046
LAURA: While he's doing it, I'm getting ready. I'm
doing this. I'm going to cast Mirror Image of myself.

2346
02:50:14,046 --> 02:50:16,621
MATT: Duplicity, or are you doing Mirror Image,
the spell?

2347
02:50:16,621 --> 02:50:17,809
LAURA: Mirror Image.

2348
02:50:17,809 --> 02:50:22,309
MARISHA: Let's all agree that if this goes bad, we
run.

2349
02:50:22,309 --> 02:50:32,289
LAURA: Suddenly, there are three me's around
myself.

2350
02:50:32,289 --> 02:50:40,064
TRAVIS: If we need to close it off, light the tip
of that little wick and throw it.

2351
02:50:40,064 --> 02:50:42,305
LIAM: Are we going right now?

2352
02:50:42,305 --> 02:50:43,630
MARISHA: Oh God.

2353
02:50:43,630 --> 02:50:49,596
SAM: Are any of them holding anything that they
put down for a second, or they got it firmly in

2354
02:50:49,596 --> 02:50:50,886
their claws?

2355
02:50:50,886 --> 02:50:57,336
MATT: The one that breaks and sucks the marrow out
of one of the large, shoulder blade areas takes and

2356
02:50:57,336 --> 02:51:02,225
grinds the teeth against it, scooping out
whatever's inside, then throws that piece onto the

2357
02:51:02,225 --> 02:51:06,571
ground next to it, then takes the arm and begins
to splinter the middle of the arm bone and try to

2358
02:51:06,571 --> 02:51:08,477
get the marrow out of that.

2359
02:51:08,477 --> 02:51:10,037
SAM: Are you going to do your thing?

2360
02:51:10,091 --> 02:51:11,095
LIAM: Are you about to go?

2361
02:51:11,095 --> 02:51:12,403
SAM: I don't know. You tell me.

2362
02:51:12,403 --> 02:51:18,211
LIAM: I'm going to really quickly mutter a few
arcane words, then there is another Caleb blinking

2363
02:51:18,211 --> 02:51:23,052
in front of me a little bit and behind me a little
bit. It is hard to see me at the moment.

2364
02:51:23,052 --> 02:51:25,368
LAURA: Are you casting Blur or Mirror Image?

2365
02:51:25,368 --> 02:51:27,650
SAM: What are those words?

2366
02:51:27,650 --> 02:51:31,005
LAURA: I want to know for my own sake.

2367
02:51:31,005 --> 02:51:32,864
LIAM: I don't care.

2368
02:51:32,864 --> 02:51:47,656
MARISHA: Can I get more into a place with Beau? In
this crux, mirroring Nott. Stealth check? Natural 20!

2369
02:51:47,656 --> 02:51:53,267
MATT: Does your spell have concentration? You are
concentrating on a spell at the moment. Beau, you

2370
02:51:53,267 --> 02:51:57,833
quickly leap and land with no sound, catlike
reflexes.

2371
02:51:57,833 --> 02:51:59,221
MARISHA: Three-point landing.

2372
02:51:59,221 --> 02:52:03,725
MATT: Your foot does slide for a second as you
glance down, and where you stepped in, it looks

2373
02:52:03,725 --> 02:52:09,229
like there's a bit of leftover pieces of people.

2374
02:52:09,229 --> 02:52:12,469
MARISHA: I (gagging).

2375
02:52:12,469 --> 02:52:22,321
SAM: I whisper a couple words and use Mage Hand to
pick up the little piece of shoulder blade he

2376
02:52:22,321 --> 02:52:25,529
dropped and throw it in the face of the other
guy.

2377
02:52:25,529 --> 02:52:35,931
MATT: Okay. It slowly lifts, and one of the other
gnolls that's eating (splat), (growling), and the

2378
02:52:35,931 --> 02:52:40,657
other one goes (yipping), and they go back to
eating.

2379
02:52:40,657 --> 02:52:49,022
SAM: They don't care. Thought they would kill each
other, I don't know. That was it. We're level

2380
02:52:49,022 --> 02:52:50,816
three, that's all I got!

2381
02:52:50,816 --> 02:52:59,334
LIAM: (whoomp) A little halfling-sized person of
light appears behind the gnoll at the far end there.

2382
02:52:59,334 --> 02:53:00,779
MATT: What is it? What are you using?

2383
02:53:00,779 --> 02:53:04,184
LIAM: I'm using Dancing Lights. You can use the
four lights to make a little person, a little

2384
02:53:04,184 --> 02:53:12,476
humanoid shape of light. It is doing a little
macarena behind the gnoll all the way. I have 120

2385
02:53:12,476 --> 02:53:13,702
feet of range.

2386
02:53:13,702 --> 02:53:18,385
MATT: That spell is not concentration? Right,
okay.

2387
02:53:18,385 --> 02:53:25,666
LIAM: Yes, it is. But I would know that. I'm not
going to do that, because of my keen memory that

2388
02:53:25,666 --> 02:53:30,070
Caleb has, but not Liam.

2389
02:53:30,070 --> 02:53:36,016
SAM: I'm going to turn around and whisper to
Caleb: Are you going to do the thing? But I'm

2390
02:53:36,016 --> 02:53:43,440
using Message, so no one can hear us. Are you
going to do the thing? If not, I can do my thing.

2391
02:53:43,440 --> 02:53:50,143
LIAM: I send Frumpkin through the chamber and down
and starts battering into the walls here.

2392
02:53:50,143 --> 02:53:56,999
MATT: As soon as Frumpkin begins doing that, you
watch as the one that's nearest on this side, the

2393
02:53:56,999 --> 02:54:03,990
one that had dropped the arm piece earlier, takes
the bow off its back and begins to notch an arrow,

2394
02:54:03,990 --> 02:54:11,901
looking around. It's going to take a shot at the
bird fluttering through. That is a 17. What's Frumpkin's--?

2395
02:54:11,901 --> 02:54:14,772
LIAM: Oh, I'm sure that hits. Yeah.

2396
02:54:14,772 --> 02:54:27,423
MATT: Six points of piercing damage. The bird goes
(thud) on the ground and then dissipates. You

2397
02:54:27,423 --> 02:54:36,100
watch as the four hyenas suddenly rush in towards
where the bird had fallen, and they all go to the

2398
02:54:36,100 --> 02:54:41,362
spot where it landed and find an arrow lying
there, and (snarling and yipping).

2399
02:54:41,362 --> 02:54:47,074
LAURA: I cast Spiritual Weapon above the two
gnolls directly in front of me.

2400
02:54:47,074 --> 02:54:50,755
MATT: The range on that is--?

2401
02:54:50,755 --> 02:54:53,070
LAURA: Range on that is 60 feet.

2402
02:54:53,070 --> 02:54:54,896
MATT: You're placing it where? Right there?

2403
02:54:54,896 --> 02:55:02,961
LAURA: Yeah, right there. It's going to giant
lollipop down and smack one of them in the face.

2404
02:55:02,961 --> 02:55:04,446
MATT: All right. Which one?

2405
02:55:04,446 --> 02:55:10,142
LAURA: This one. The one on your left.

2406
02:55:10,142 --> 02:55:15,770
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll a spell attack.

2407
02:55:15,770 --> 02:55:18,707
LAURA: Ooh, 19 plus whatever!

2408
02:55:18,707 --> 02:55:22,627
MATT: Nice. Roll damage on that, that definitely
hits.

2409
02:55:22,627 --> 02:55:29,518
LAURA: That is nine force damage, and that's my
bonus.

2410
02:55:29,518 --> 02:55:31,182
SAM: Damn.

2411
02:55:31,182 --> 02:55:41,852
LAURA: Then I can do a cantrip. For my action, I'm
going to cast Sacred Flame at the same dude.

2412
02:55:41,852 --> 02:55:45,478
MATT: Same dude? That is a 15.

2413
02:55:45,478 --> 02:55:49,814
LAURA: He saves, so is it half, or--?

2414
02:55:49,814 --> 02:55:52,215
TRAVIS: What kind of a check was it?

2415
02:55:52,215 --> 02:55:55,122
MATT: That would have been his dexterity saving
throw, right?

2416
02:55:55,122 --> 02:56:00,983
LAURA: Yes. "Must succeed," so it probably doesn't
do anything.

2417
02:56:00,983 --> 02:56:07,356
MATT: Yeah, then no damage. Okay, that ends your
turn. Everyone else gets one action and then we

2418
02:56:07,356 --> 02:56:08,702
roll initiative.

2419
02:56:08,702 --> 02:56:12,589
LAURA: Can I run down the steps and hide behind
a barrel like it's going to make any fucking

2420
02:56:12,589 --> 02:56:14,288
difference at all?

2421
02:56:14,288 --> 02:56:20,339
MATT: Sure. You won't get to hide, though, but
you're there. You're standing next to a barrel.

2422
02:56:20,339 --> 02:56:22,959
All righty, who's up next?

2423
02:56:22,959 --> 02:56:24,179
TRAVIS: I'm ready.

2424
02:56:24,179 --> 02:56:25,223
MATT: Fjord, what you got?

2425
02:56:25,223 --> 02:56:29,938
TRAVIS: Can you point to one of them that is not
undead? Just looks like a regular gnoll, or I can

2426
02:56:29,938 --> 02:56:31,200
just pick one.

2427
02:56:31,200 --> 02:56:34,233
MATT: You can pick one. All of the gnolls in here
look like regular gnolls.

2428
02:56:34,233 --> 02:56:36,506
TRAVIS: Great. Did you aim at that one?

2429
02:56:36,506 --> 02:56:38,713
LAURA: No, I aimed at the other one.

2430
02:56:38,713 --> 02:56:40,615
TRAVIS: Okay, I'll take that far one.

2431
02:56:40,615 --> 02:56:41,900
MATT: What are you doing?

2432
02:56:41,900 --> 02:56:46,903
TRAVIS: Can I focus and summon my falchion into my
hand?

2433
02:56:46,903 --> 02:56:56,344
MATT: Yep. It appears into your space in a burst
of dull greenish-blue fire, and there you see it,

2434
02:56:56,344 --> 02:56:58,749
dripping with salt water across its blade.

2435
02:56:58,749 --> 02:57:05,236
TRAVIS: Can I use my bonus action to cast Hex at
that right gnoll?

2436
02:57:05,236 --> 02:57:11,919
MATT: You may. That one is now hexed. You watch as
the gore that's been dripping from the front of

2437
02:57:11,919 --> 02:57:18,868
its body seems to roll up its torso in reverse
before it slips into its armor and grasps itself,

2438
02:57:18,868 --> 02:57:22,267
the darkened shadowed gore now holding it in place
as the Hex curse.

2439
02:57:22,267 --> 02:57:25,533
TRAVIS: Can I reach back and fire Eldritch Blast
into it?

2440
02:57:25,533 --> 02:57:27,286
MATT: You may.

2441
02:57:27,286 --> 02:57:29,184
TRAVIS: 16.

2442
02:57:29,184 --> 02:57:34,287
MATT: That hits. Plus 1d6.

2443
02:57:34,287 --> 02:57:45,645
TRAVIS: Six plus four, ten, 1d6, 15 points of
damage.

2444
02:57:45,645 --> 02:57:50,798
MATT: 15 points of damage. (explosion) That one
immediately drops what it was eating as the blast

2445
02:57:50,798 --> 02:57:56,997
slams into it, as it's confused by the wrapping of
the Hex. As it reels and almost stumbles onto its

2446
02:57:56,997 --> 02:58:01,846
back, its foot crushes one of the nearby skulls,
and there you see this gaping wound in its chest

2447
02:58:01,846 --> 02:58:07,663
where the armor's been sundered. There's a smoking
plume of blackened, horrible, shaded smoke pouring

2448
02:58:07,663 --> 02:58:08,740
from it.

2449
02:58:08,740 --> 02:58:12,526
TRAVIS: Can I use my distance to move over here,
if I may?

2450
02:58:12,526 --> 02:58:16,201
MATT: That's as far as you can, there.

2451
02:58:16,201 --> 02:58:19,526
TRAVIS: Am I in your line of sight, Jester? Does
anybody need that?

2452
02:58:19,526 --> 02:58:20,848
LAURA: Nah, you're fine.

2453
02:58:20,848 --> 02:58:21,891
MARISHA: Nope.

2454
02:58:21,891 --> 02:58:23,662
MATT: Beau?

2455
02:58:23,662 --> 02:58:29,513
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to do something weird,
and I hope it works and doesn't fuck the rest of

2456
02:58:29,513 --> 02:58:40,598
us. I'll move up right here next to Fjord. 40.
That works good there.

2457
02:58:40,598 --> 02:58:42,293
MATT: That's 20 there.

2458
02:58:42,293 --> 02:58:51,863
MARISHA: Let me go one more. That's good. Then can
I reach in my bag and grab out, in my little

2459
02:58:51,863 --> 02:58:57,236
pouch, grab out a handful out of my 1,000 ball
bearings?

2460
02:58:57,236 --> 02:59:03,729
TRAVIS: You do have 1,000 ball bearings, I
remember that. We had money. She bought a lot of

2461
02:59:03,729 --> 02:59:05,469
fucking ball bearings.

2462
02:59:05,469 --> 02:59:12,016
MARISHA: A lot of ball bearings! Can I take it
and-- you know how you can take your pocket and

2463
02:59:12,016 --> 02:59:17,611
flip it inside out? And have a bunch of ball
bearings go (metallic clinking) across this way?

2464
02:59:17,611 --> 02:59:24,344
MATT: You hear hundreds of tiny metal clangs in
succession as ball bearings begin to spray down

2465
02:59:24,344 --> 02:59:30,815
the stairs and scattering across the floor of this
central makeshift ritual room. As they run through

2466
02:59:30,817 --> 02:59:35,723
the semblances of gore and the areas of the
stonework that are exposed between, you have spent

2467
02:59:35,723 --> 02:59:37,082
your action scattering.

2468
02:59:37,082 --> 02:59:41,242
MARISHA: Is that my action? Okay, I'm going to
spend a ki point, and as my bonus action take

2469
02:59:41,242 --> 02:59:42,443
Patient Defense.

2470
02:59:42,443 --> 02:59:47,721
MATT: Nice. As soon as you empty those out, you
get back and go into your defensive position,

2471
02:59:47,721 --> 02:59:49,759
preparing for any sort of assault. Caleb?

2472
02:59:49,759 --> 02:59:54,770
LIAM: The effect of that hasn't taken place yet,
correct?

2473
02:59:54,770 --> 02:59:58,092
MATT: The ball bearings, in this moment, are now
clattering down into the ground.

2474
02:59:58,092 --> 02:59:59,967
LIAM: Did Fjord hit one successfully?

2475
02:59:59,967 --> 03:00:00,868
MATT: He did, yes.

2476
03:00:00,868 --> 03:00:06,659
LIAM: That same one? I am just going to Fire Bolt
it. From yeah, yeah.

2477
03:00:06,659 --> 03:00:08,080
MATT: Roll for an attack.

2478
03:00:08,080 --> 03:00:14,052
LIAM: Fire Bolt. That is an attack range guy,
plus six that is a 15 to hit.

2479
03:00:14,052 --> 03:00:19,770
MATT: That hits, just barely.

2480
03:00:19,770 --> 03:00:21,199
LIAM: The damage is seven.

2481
03:00:21,199 --> 03:00:25,531
MATT: Seven points of damage. The one that you
had hexed suddenly goes up into flames with a

2482
03:00:25,531 --> 03:00:28,266
(dying scream) and falls back onto the ground.

2483
03:00:28,266 --> 03:00:34,511
LIAM: I'll use my movement to back up about 15
feet just outside of the chamber.

2484
03:00:34,511 --> 03:00:44,391
MATT: You are just there. As the flash of red
light arcs from his finger and lights up the path

2485
03:00:44,391 --> 03:00:47,739
before it impacts and kills the gnoll, Caleb then
steps back into the shadows, trying to get out of

2486
03:00:47,739 --> 03:00:49,383
the way. Nott?

2487
03:00:49,383 --> 03:00:53,390
SAM: Oh, I get a turn as well? Because I did the
Mage Hand thing.

2488
03:00:53,390 --> 03:00:59,338
MATT: Yes, but that technically did not initiate
into a combat. It just bothered one of them.

2489
03:00:59,338 --> 03:01:02,327
SAM: Mildly.

2490
03:01:02,327 --> 03:01:04,365
MATT: A temporary inconvenience.

2491
03:01:04,365 --> 03:01:12,070
SAM: Sure, I'll send an arrow down into the one
that Jester attacked.

2492
03:01:12,070 --> 03:01:13,713
MATT: Go for it.

2493
03:01:13,713 --> 03:01:17,122
SAM: That's 23.

2494
03:01:17,122 --> 03:01:20,767
MATT: 23 hits. Roll damage.

2495
03:01:20,767 --> 03:01:21,628
SAM: Nine.

2496
03:01:21,628 --> 03:01:23,572
MATT: Nine plus your sneak attack.

2497
03:01:23,572 --> 03:01:24,879
SAM: This is a sneak attack?

2498
03:01:24,879 --> 03:01:26,807
MATT: Because you were stealthed.

2499
03:01:26,807 --> 03:01:27,866
SAM: 14.

2500
03:01:27,866 --> 03:01:31,163
LIAM: Rogue, best class.

2501
03:01:31,163 --> 03:01:38,315
MATT: That one (explosion). The bolt goes through
the center of his forehead and embeds itself right

2502
03:01:38,315 --> 03:01:45,338
up to the very back. You watch as it (dying scream) and
falls into the ground over one of the piled corpse

2503
03:01:45,338 --> 03:01:50,441
pieces it was tearing through. Becoming one with its
meal. And then?

2504
03:01:50,441 --> 03:01:52,747
SAM: Crouch back and hide.

2505
03:01:52,747 --> 03:01:56,827
MATT: Okay, make a hide check to try and disappear
back there. Stealth on that one.

2506
03:01:56,827 --> 03:01:59,696
SAM: Advantage, but disadvantage, so 16.

2507
03:01:59,696 --> 03:02:04,635
MATT: Okay. You did your thing. Molly?

2508
03:02:04,635 --> 03:02:10,105
TALIESIN: I'm going to creep out against the wall
closest to me and try and hide in one of these

2509
03:02:10,105 --> 03:02:13,663
coves. Over in the corner, as far as I can get
into the--

2510
03:02:13,663 --> 03:02:17,507
MATT: You can get right into the similar space as
Nott there.

2511
03:02:17,507 --> 03:02:18,784
SAM: Does he see me?

2512
03:02:18,784 --> 03:02:21,743
MATT: I would say barely.

2513
03:02:21,743 --> 03:02:24,917
TRAVIS: Hello!

2514
03:02:24,917 --> 03:02:26,203
SAM: Hi.

2515
03:02:26,203 --> 03:02:32,611
TALIESIN: Since I'm too far away for anything too
crazy, I don't have a good bonus action. I will

2516
03:02:32,611 --> 03:02:43,420
use my Devil's Tongue, I'll use Vicious Mockery on
the gnoll that's currently in between-- not the

2517
03:02:43,420 --> 03:02:50,128
one that's-- actually, the one that's furthest from
us, because he's going to be the archer, and in

2518
03:02:50,128 --> 03:02:57,346
Infernal I'm going to say: I'm too disgusted to
think of anything clever.

2519
03:02:57,346 --> 03:03:00,905
MATT: It rolled a natural one on its saving throw.

2520
03:03:00,905 --> 03:03:08,175
TALIESIN: So yeah, that's three psychic damage and
he has disadvantage on his next attack.

2521
03:03:08,175 --> 03:03:11,520
MATT: Good to know. Now, everyone please roll
initiative.

2522
03:03:11,520 --> 03:03:17,292
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

2523
03:03:17,292 --> 03:03:23,658
SAM: Natural 20. Do I have to roll with
disadvantage, is this dex or intelligence?

2524
03:03:23,658 --> 03:03:27,271
MATT: It's technically a dexterity ability check
so it would be disadvantage, yeah.

2525
03:03:27,271 --> 03:03:30,444
SAM: Two, so six.

2526
03:03:30,444 --> 03:03:31,871
LAURA: That is so sad.

2527
03:03:31,871 --> 03:03:32,961
MATT: 25 to 20?

2528
03:03:32,961 --> 03:03:34,125
TALIESIN: 23.

2529
03:03:34,125 --> 03:03:35,373
TRAVIS: Yes.

2530
03:03:35,373 --> 03:03:38,458
MATT: Fjord, what did you get?

2531
03:03:38,458 --> 03:03:39,851
TRAVIS: Four.

2532
03:03:39,851 --> 03:03:42,132
MATT: Sorry. So who else rolled a natural 20?

2533
03:03:42,132 --> 03:03:46,362
SAM: I did, but I got a disadvantage.

2534
03:03:46,362 --> 03:03:49,106
MATT: Right, yeah. But don't you have advantage
with--

2535
03:03:49,106 --> 03:03:51,420
SAM: On stealth.

2536
03:03:51,420 --> 03:03:57,456
MATT: Just on stealth checks, that's right. So
Molly's up first. That's a fun little initiative

2537
03:03:57,456 --> 03:04:01,656
tracker thing from our friends at Axe &amp; Shield.
See how it helps out there.

2538
03:04:01,656 --> 03:04:04,612
TALIESIN: I was 23.

2539
03:04:04,612 --> 03:04:06,665
MATT: 23. 20 to 15?

2540
03:04:06,665 --> 03:04:08,468
MARISHA and LIAM: 17.

2541
03:04:08,468 --> 03:04:14,172
MATT: The gnolls rolled a natural 18 plus one, so
they're at 19. Gnolls are next.

2542
03:04:14,172 --> 03:04:16,621
TRAVIS: Oh, the gnolls are next.

2543
03:04:16,621 --> 03:04:19,533
MATT: Both of you guys are at 17?

2544
03:04:19,533 --> 03:04:24,388
MARISHA: I'm shaking.

2545
03:04:24,388 --> 03:04:26,168
MATT: 15 to ten?

2546
03:04:26,168 --> 03:04:27,314
LAURA: 13.

2547
03:04:27,314 --> 03:04:32,464
MATT: Jester got 13. Ten to five?

2548
03:04:32,464 --> 03:04:33,658
SAM: Six.

2549
03:04:33,746 --> 03:04:35,921
TRAVIS: I'm at four.

2550
03:04:35,921 --> 03:04:46,304
MATT: They hyenas are before Nott. Then we have
Nott, then we have Fjord. Molly, you're at the top

2551
03:04:46,304 --> 03:04:47,495
of the round.

2552
03:04:47,495 --> 03:04:48,856
TALIESIN: God, that's awful.

2553
03:04:48,856 --> 03:04:55,927
MARISHA: God, that's bad. I don't think I even
fucking spelled it right. I think I botched that

2554
03:04:55,927 --> 03:04:59,892
all across the board. I spelled it "Hyneas."

2555
03:04:59,892 --> 03:05:04,154
MATT: Gets the idea across. The special hyena.

2556
03:05:04,154 --> 03:05:05,786
LAURA: "Hyneas!"

2557
03:05:05,786 --> 03:05:08,792
MATT: What you got, Molly?

2558
03:05:08,792 --> 03:05:19,349
TALIESIN: I'm going to get a little-- Oh, can I do
this? No, I can't do that. Fuck. I know, I'm so

2559
03:05:19,349 --> 03:05:23,679
sorry. I should have my shit together. How far
(counting)? Oh god, that's too far to walk. I'm

2560
03:05:23,679 --> 03:05:28,969
going to try and get one little crevice. Actually,
I'm going to hold my position. I'm so sorry.

2561
03:05:28,969 --> 03:05:30,174
MATT: Hold your position?

2562
03:05:30,174 --> 03:05:37,297
TALIESIN: Hold my position and use one more Tongue
on one of the other guys.

2563
03:05:37,297 --> 03:05:39,122
MATT: All right. Natural 20 on the saving throw,
unfortunately.

2564
03:05:39,122 --> 03:05:40,120
TALIESIN: Oh, so no.

2565
03:05:40,120 --> 03:05:40,969
MATT: Sorry.

2566
03:05:40,969 --> 03:05:44,716
TALIESIN: (coughs) and I'm holding.

2567
03:05:44,716 --> 03:05:52,251
MATT: All right, that's your turn. All right, the
gnolls are up first. These two here are going to

2568
03:05:52,251 --> 03:06:00,011
pull out their bow and begin to fire at Beau.
Since you had been the first to appear at this

2569
03:06:00,011 --> 03:06:05,709
point and gather their attention. They both have
disadvantage on the attacks. That is going to be

2570
03:06:05,709 --> 03:06:07,074
an 11.

2571
03:06:07,074 --> 03:06:08,230
MARISHA: Miss.

2572
03:06:08,230 --> 03:06:13,252
MATT: The other is two 14s in a row, so it would
be 18 to hit.

2573
03:06:13,252 --> 03:06:14,805
MARISHA: Oh, hit. With disadvantage?

2574
03:06:14,805 --> 03:06:16,338
MATT: 17 to hit, sorry.

2575
03:06:16,338 --> 03:06:17,279
MARISHA: Hit.

2576
03:06:17,279 --> 03:06:18,191
MATT: Yeah, all right.

2577
03:06:18,191 --> 03:06:20,065
MARISHA: 17 is my armor class.

2578
03:06:20,065 --> 03:06:21,453
MATT: That would be--

2579
03:06:21,453 --> 03:06:22,585
MARISHA: This is with a bow?

2580
03:06:22,585 --> 03:06:25,746
MATT: Yep. That's going to be ten points of
piercing damage to you.

2581
03:06:25,746 --> 03:06:30,537
MARISHA: I'm going to cat-paw try to catch the
missile with Deflect Missiles. What do I spend--

2582
03:06:30,537 --> 03:06:34,155
Oh, wait. Oh no, wait, this is a ki point.

2583
03:06:34,155 --> 03:06:35,707
MATT: Well, it's a ki point to throw it back.

2584
03:06:35,707 --> 03:06:41,697
MARISHA: Oh no, it's a ki point to throw it back,
it's just a reaction. It's 1d10 plus seven. Nine

2585
03:06:41,697 --> 03:06:43,939
plus seven, so 16.

2586
03:06:43,939 --> 03:06:46,110
MATT: You catch it in mid-air and reduce it to no
damage.

2587
03:06:46,110 --> 03:06:47,566
TRAVIS: Fucking dope!

2588
03:06:47,566 --> 03:06:51,176
MARISHA: I hold it out like a microphone and go--

2589
03:06:51,176 --> 03:06:58,588
MATT: As you do that, the one in the bottom of the
ground, who is closest to you, grabs its

2590
03:06:58,588 --> 03:07:02,505
spear off the side of the wall. (growling) Runs up
the stairs.

2591
03:07:02,505 --> 03:07:04,325
TALIESIN: Does it hit the ball bearings?

2592
03:07:04,325 --> 03:07:05,210
MATT: That's what I'm--

2593
03:07:05,210 --> 03:07:06,057
TALIESIN: Oh, okay.

2594
03:07:06,057 --> 03:07:11,866
MATT: Rolling its dexterity check to see if it can
do so. It does succeed. It's a 15. It slips, but

2595
03:07:11,866 --> 03:07:14,510
it manages to make its way up the stairs.

2596
03:07:14,510 --> 03:07:16,950
MARISHA: I laugh at it, as it comes at me.

2597
03:07:16,950 --> 03:07:18,447
LAURA: He looks so stupid.

2598
03:07:18,447 --> 03:07:24,323
MATT: Coming into combat with both Fjord and Beau.
He's going to go ahead and reach out at you with

2599
03:07:24,323 --> 03:07:27,014
that. It's going to be a 16?

2600
03:07:27,014 --> 03:07:28,100
MARISHA: Miss.

2601
03:07:28,100 --> 03:07:29,198
MATT: 16 misses.

2602
03:07:29,198 --> 03:07:32,534
LIAM: I hope we at least heard the Looney Tunes
bongos (bongo noises).

2603
03:07:32,534 --> 03:07:36,272
MATT: After you drop the arrow, it comes up and
you parry this one off to the side and go back

2604
03:07:36,272 --> 03:07:45,238
into your defensive stance. That ends both of
those's go there. Now, comes to Caleb.

2605
03:07:45,238 --> 03:07:51,216
LIAM: Yeah, I can see from where I am, I can see
Fjord and Beau with one of these things. I'm going

2606
03:07:51,216 --> 03:07:54,164
to Fire Bolt right from where I am.

2607
03:07:54,164 --> 03:07:56,009
MATT: All right, go for it. Roll for attack.

2608
03:07:56,009 --> 03:07:58,249
LIAM: That's it. Aw, no.

2609
03:07:58,249 --> 03:08:02,928
TRAVIS: "Aw, no."

2610
03:08:02,928 --> 03:08:09,079
MATT: It strikes part of the stone altar,
splintering candle wax and pieces of remnant heart

2611
03:08:09,079 --> 03:08:12,526
chunks, but no impact unfortunately on the actual
gnoll.

2612
03:08:12,526 --> 03:08:13,764
LIAM: Sorry!

2613
03:08:13,764 --> 03:08:15,241
MATT: You going to stay where you are?

2614
03:08:15,241 --> 03:08:19,464
LIAM: Yeah. I will walk just inside the--

2615
03:08:19,464 --> 03:08:20,832
LAURA: Did you go, Beau?

2616
03:08:20,832 --> 03:08:22,337
MARISHA: I haven't, but we rolled at the same
time.

2617
03:08:22,337 --> 03:08:25,273
MATT: Right, so Beau, you want to go with your
action now?

2618
03:08:25,273 --> 03:08:30,703
MARISHA: Yes! I'm going to take my staff, I'm
going to try and crack this guy on the back of his

2619
03:08:30,703 --> 03:08:31,859
head where he is.

2620
03:08:31,859 --> 03:08:33,102
MATT: Go for it.

2621
03:08:33,102 --> 03:08:40,363
MARISHA: Jesus Christ al-fucking-mighty. 13? Does
that hit?

2622
03:08:40,363 --> 03:08:44,346
MATT: As you swing the bo back, trying to crack
him in the head, it actually slips on one of the

2623
03:08:44,346 --> 03:08:49,126
ball bearings you had left, and as it manages to
catch itself, it falls out of range of your sweep

2624
03:08:49,126 --> 03:08:50,969
of the bo. You're like, "Shit!"

2625
03:08:50,969 --> 03:08:58,784
MARISHA: I'm my own worst enemy! I'm going to do a
knee and a round kick-- Oh no, sorry. I can

2626
03:08:58,784 --> 03:09:02,961
just do one. I'm thinking in advance. One kick
with the knee!

2627
03:09:02,961 --> 03:09:04,961
MATT: All right, go for the attack.

2628
03:09:04,961 --> 03:09:07,572
TRAVIS: Damn.

2629
03:09:07,572 --> 03:09:09,932
LAURA: Do you want my dice bag?

2630
03:09:09,932 --> 03:09:13,683
MATT: You slip on one of your own ball bearings on
the second strike, and manage to catch yourself by

2631
03:09:13,683 --> 03:09:18,574
grabbing the fur on the outside of the gnoll and
using its body to right yourself, and then, "Ugh."

2632
03:09:18,574 --> 03:09:20,618
It's a little slick and sticky.

2633
03:09:20,618 --> 03:09:23,110
MARISHA: I wipe my hand on Fjord really quick.

2634
03:09:23,110 --> 03:09:26,225
MATT: All right, Jester, you're up.

2635
03:09:26,225 --> 03:09:28,724
LAURA: Okay. Have any of them been hurt yet?

2636
03:09:28,724 --> 03:09:31,357
MATT: That are standing? This one has been hurt a
little bit.

2637
03:09:31,357 --> 03:09:40,609
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to move my Spiritual Weapon
over to the one on the ground, directly in front

2638
03:09:40,609 --> 03:09:53,295
of Beau. Oh, I meant on the lower level. Yeah, and
it's going to hit him! Whoa. 16 plus five.

2639
03:09:53,295 --> 03:09:55,514
MATT: 16 hits, plus five hits even more.

2640
03:09:55,514 --> 03:10:00,006
LAURA: That's nine points of force damage.

2641
03:10:00,006 --> 03:10:04,120
MATT: Nine points of force damage as the lollipop
hits it in the back of the skull and it leans forward

2642
03:10:04,120 --> 03:10:09,907
and grabs the back of its skull with this
pounding, throbbing pain in its head.

2643
03:10:09,907 --> 03:10:14,281
LAURA: And then I'm going to use Toll The Dead on
the one in front of Beau.

2644
03:10:14,281 --> 03:10:16,507
MATT: All righty. So what does it have to roll?

2645
03:10:16,507 --> 03:10:24,455
LAURA: He has to roll a wisdom saving throw.

2646
03:10:24,455 --> 03:10:28,259
MATT: Okay. And the range of that one is?

2647
03:10:28,259 --> 03:10:29,647
LAURA: 60 feet.

2648
03:10:29,647 --> 03:10:35,000
MATT: So that rolls a nine plus zero, nine.

2649
03:10:35,000 --> 03:10:42,527
LAURA: Yeah! So he takes 1d12 necrotic damage!
Two. It's a little bell this time.

2650
03:10:42,527 --> 03:10:47,254
MATT: Just a little bell. You watch as a little bit
of blood comes out the side one of the hyena's ears.

2651
03:10:47,254 --> 03:10:51,035
TALIESIN: I like to think that your lollipop makes
Candy Crush sounds when it hits people.

2652
03:10:51,106 --> 03:10:59,416
LIAM: Jester, is the lollipop the flat kind or the
round kind?

2653
03:10:59,416 --> 03:11:01,947
LAURA: I'm picturing the flat kind, so it can
whack.

2654
03:11:01,947 --> 03:11:05,137
MATT: So the spiral kind? Gotcha. Are you going to
move at all, or are you going to stay where you are?

2655
03:11:05,137 --> 03:11:06,961
LAURA: I'm going to stay right there.

2656
03:11:06,961 --> 03:11:09,058
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn.

2657
03:11:09,058 --> 03:11:16,155
LAURA: And then I make my mirror images be like--
I guess they're doing that because I'm doing that

2658
03:11:16,155 --> 03:11:17,816
because they're my mirror images.

2659
03:11:17,816 --> 03:11:23,062
MATT: There you go! There is a whole dance number
over there of multiple Jesters. The hyenas go now.

2660
03:11:23,062 --> 03:11:29,050
TRAVIS: (sings tune to "Single Ladies.")

2661
03:11:29,050 --> 03:11:30,962
LIAM: That's the best.

2662
03:11:30,962 --> 03:11:36,575
MATT: Does succeed on his dex save. This one's going
to attempt--

2663
03:11:36,575 --> 03:11:39,502
TRAVIS: (singing) If you liked it, then you should
have put a ring on it.

2664
03:11:39,502 --> 03:11:42,843
MATT: Leaps up to there. Dexterity saving throw,
does succeed.

2665
03:11:42,843 --> 03:11:52,599
LAURA: Oh jeez, there's a lot of them. That's a
bigger one, it looks like.

2666
03:11:52,599 --> 03:11:58,011
MATT: Succeeds! They're actually
rolling pretty high for their saving throws. This

2667
03:11:58,058 --> 03:12:03,167
one will be a three, that one does not make it.
This one gets partway over and then falls prone

2668
03:12:03,167 --> 03:12:07,370
there. Uses the other half of its movement to get
up, but that's as far as it can get. It can't

2669
03:12:07,370 --> 03:12:12,238
actually attack for this round. It's going to use its
movement to make the rest of its run up to the top

2670
03:12:12,238 --> 03:12:16,153
of the stairs. So that one does not get an action
this turn because it slipped on the ball bearings.

2671
03:12:16,153 --> 03:12:18,624
It's going to be one attack against Beau.

2672
03:12:18,624 --> 03:12:20,067
MARISHA: Whoa, it was effective!

2673
03:12:20,067 --> 03:12:24,778
MATT: With disadvantage. That's a natural 20, and
a six.

2674
03:12:24,778 --> 03:12:26,424
MARISHA: Yeah!

2675
03:12:26,424 --> 03:12:33,416
MATT: Yeah, that does not hit, not at all. It's
plus two. The hyena rushes up and lashes out

2676
03:12:33,416 --> 03:12:36,252
towards you, and you just pop, slap it in the nose and
it pulls back.

2677
03:12:36,252 --> 03:12:38,383
MARISHA: Nose punch.

2678
03:12:38,383 --> 03:12:42,891
MATT: Yep. The two other ones that rush up and
come along the flank with the hyena to you, Fjord.

2679
03:12:42,891 --> 03:12:47,235
First one goes, that is going to be a 15 plus two,
17?

2680
03:12:47,235 --> 03:12:48,531
TRAVIS: That will hit.

2681
03:12:48,531 --> 03:12:55,702
MATT: All right. Actually, it has advantage on the
roll because of pack tactics. It didn't really

2682
03:12:55,702 --> 03:13:03,028
help, let's see here. You take two points of
piercing damage.

2683
03:13:03,028 --> 03:13:04,523
TRAVIS: Okay.

2684
03:13:04,523 --> 03:13:06,176
MATT: The other one is going to attack you.

2685
03:13:06,176 --> 03:13:08,928
TRAVIS: It will take ten points of cold damage in
return.

2686
03:13:08,928 --> 03:13:15,668
MATT: (laughs) Which causes it to shatter into ice
on the ground. It bites you and its snout

2687
03:13:15,668 --> 03:13:20,436
(explosion) T-1000 style. It shatters into a
million ice pieces.

2688
03:13:20,436 --> 03:13:22,149
TALIESIN: You lost a gnoll there.

2689
03:13:22,149 --> 03:13:23,133
MATT: Yep.

2690
03:13:23,133 --> 03:13:28,023
TALIESIN: No, you've got a gnoll. You should have
that looked at.

2691
03:13:28,023 --> 03:13:33,635
MATT: Thank you. The other one is going to take a
strike at you. Natural 20, it's a critical hit. 20

2692
03:13:33,635 --> 03:13:40,189
and ten. That pack tactics is nasty. That means
you, for dice wise, suffer eight points of

2693
03:13:40,189 --> 03:13:48,585
piercing damage. It takes ten and it explodes into
ice as well. Both of these hyenas rush up and

2694
03:13:48,585 --> 03:13:54,229
strike and both in succession disintegrate into
shards of ice across the ground.

2695
03:13:54,229 --> 03:13:55,663
LAURA: That is the coolest spell ever.

2696
03:13:55,663 --> 03:13:58,744
TALIESIN: It's so hardcore.

2697
03:13:58,744 --> 03:13:59,824
MATT: The spell is gone though, right?

2698
03:13:59,824 --> 03:14:00,948
TRAVIS: That's it.

2699
03:14:00,948 --> 03:14:04,320
MATT: That's going to end the hyenas' turn. Nott,
you're up.

2700
03:14:04,320 --> 03:14:11,964
SAM: Okay, I'll lean out from behind Mollymauk's
buttocks and rest the hand crossbow on his left

2701
03:14:11,964 --> 03:14:14,637
cheek and fire--

2702
03:14:14,637 --> 03:14:15,820
TALIESIN: I support.

2703
03:14:15,820 --> 03:14:19,056
SAM: --on the gnoll that's engaged with Fjord.

2704
03:14:19,056 --> 03:14:20,308
MATT: Okay.

2705
03:14:20,308 --> 03:14:24,864
SAM: Firing. Eight.

2706
03:14:24,864 --> 03:14:29,869
MATT: (laughs) As you drunkenly try and aim in the
direction.

2707
03:14:29,869 --> 03:14:31,711
SAM: It's that bulbous butt!

2708
03:14:31,711 --> 03:14:37,624
MATT: You almost pull the trigger twice, but you're
aiming at Fjord and you're like, "No."

2709
03:14:37,624 --> 03:14:41,018
TALIESIN: No advantage for engagement?

2710
03:14:41,018 --> 03:14:45,208
MATT: No advantage, but he can sneak attack if he
hits. That's how it works. You finally go, and one

2711
03:14:45,208 --> 03:14:51,158
of the elements of stone in the side of the cavern
wall (impact) as the bolt hits it and goes sideways.

2712
03:14:51,158 --> 03:15:00,137
SAM:Am I still hidden? No? That exposes me, do I
have to hide again? How do rogues work?

2713
03:15:00,137 --> 03:15:02,928
MATT: Yeah, you're revealed.

2714
03:15:02,928 --> 03:15:05,244
SAM: Oh, I was revealed. Okay. So I have to hide
again.

2715
03:15:05,244 --> 03:15:08,965
MATT: You have to find a way to obscure
something's vision to you before you can hide.

2716
03:15:08,965 --> 03:15:16,333
SAM: Sure, got it. Okay, I'll run up the stairs
then and hide back near where Caleb is. Other

2717
03:15:16,333 --> 03:15:19,081
side. And then hide.

2718
03:15:19,081 --> 03:15:21,521
MATT: That'll work. Go ahead and roll a stealth
check as your bonus.

2719
03:15:21,521 --> 03:15:29,159
SAM: Well, I've cocked. Terrible. Nine plus eight
is 17! Oh, wow, I'm so stealthy.

2720
03:15:29,159 --> 03:15:34,437
MATT: You're a rogue this go-round, man. All
right, that ends Nott's turn. Fjord, you're up.

2721
03:15:34,437 --> 03:15:39,074
TRAVIS: Oh, it is my turn! Can I use my bonus
action to move my Hex from my defeated foe to my

2722
03:15:39,074 --> 03:15:40,811
new foe right in front of me?

2723
03:15:40,811 --> 03:15:42,041
MATT: You may.

2724
03:15:42,041 --> 03:15:47,316
TRAVIS: Yeah, and can I whip my falchion around
and upstrike, just try and cut right through him?

2725
03:15:47,316 --> 03:15:48,341
MATT: Go for it.

2726
03:15:48,341 --> 03:15:50,625
MARISHA and TRAVIS: (singing) I whip my falchion
back and forth.

2727
03:15:50,625 --> 03:15:53,036
TRAVIS: That's only a 16.

2728
03:15:53,036 --> 03:15:54,046
MATT: 16 hits!

2729
03:15:54,046 --> 03:15:54,827
TRAVIS: Oh, good!

2730
03:15:54,827 --> 03:15:56,255
MATT: His AC's 15.

2731
03:15:56,255 --> 03:15:57,413
TRAVIS: Can I say two-handed?

2732
03:15:57,413 --> 03:15:58,992
MATT: I'll allow it.

2733
03:15:58,992 --> 03:16:01,023
TRAVIS: I've got to get in the habit of saying
it.

2734
03:16:01,023 --> 03:16:03,162
MATT: Yeah, you've got to say it. Two-handed, I'll
allow it.

2735
03:16:03,162 --> 03:16:10,865
TRAVIS: 1d10. That's a ten! Four-- that's 14
points of damage plus a d6, that's 15 points of damage.

2736
03:16:10,865 --> 03:16:14,910
MATT: So this one, that had already-- 15 points of
damage, right?

2737
03:16:14,910 --> 03:16:15,878
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm!

2738
03:16:15,878 --> 03:16:21,192
MATT: This is the one that you hit earlier with
it. As you swing with your falchion, just spinning

2739
03:16:21,192 --> 03:16:26,497
it in your hand, you arc upward. As you do, you
watch as the gore and shadow of your Hex, which

2740
03:16:26,497 --> 03:16:31,595
now seems to grasp around its chest, almost
reaches out to meet the blade in the middle like

2741
03:16:31,595 --> 03:16:36,358
the two bits of lightning hitting in the center of
the sky. As they impact, the blade carries through

2742
03:16:36,358 --> 03:16:42,358
the momentum, the strength coming from the blade,
not from your actual body. As you do, you carve

2743
03:16:42,358 --> 03:16:47,519
through a large portion of its torso. You watch as
the hide armor folds off, revealing this huge gash

2744
03:16:47,519 --> 03:16:51,468
wound in its chest. It (snarling and growling).
It's still standing, but it's horribly wounded

2745
03:16:51,468 --> 03:16:52,713
now.

2746
03:16:52,713 --> 03:16:56,170
TRAVIS: You fucked with the wrong one, son.

2747
03:16:56,170 --> 03:16:57,538
MATT: That end your turn, Fjord?

2748
03:16:57,538 --> 03:16:58,457
TRAVIS: That does.

2749
03:16:58,457 --> 03:16:59,674
MATT: All right, to the top. Molly, you're up.

2750
03:16:59,674 --> 03:17:03,487
TALIESIN: I'm going to run up to these two and
join the fray up here.

2751
03:17:03,487 --> 03:17:05,445
MATT: All righty.

2752
03:17:05,445 --> 03:17:11,699
TALIESIN: First, I'm going to take a swing at the
big guy.

2753
03:17:11,699 --> 03:17:13,307
MATT: Go for it.

2754
03:17:13,307 --> 03:17:15,527
TALIESIN: That's 16 to hit.

2755
03:17:15,527 --> 03:17:16,963
MATT: That hits! Go ahead and roll damage.

2756
03:17:16,963 --> 03:17:24,443
TALIESIN: And that's-- just using my normal one
for this one. That's eight points of damage.

2757
03:17:24,443 --> 03:17:29,641
MATT: Eight points of damage. As soon as it rears
from the attack, Fjord, you watch as in a flash

2758
03:17:29,641 --> 03:17:35,542
the cloak billows of Mollymauk's arrival. As the
cloak falls, you just watch as the gnoll's head

2759
03:17:35,542 --> 03:17:39,662
just rolls off of its shoulders. You can see the
blow that struck it.

2760
03:17:39,662 --> 03:17:43,286
TALIESIN: Bonus action with the glowing sword goes
down into the hyena.

2761
03:17:43,286 --> 03:17:44,517
MATT: Go for it.

2762
03:17:44,517 --> 03:17:45,963
TRAVIS: Well, hot damn!

2763
03:17:45,963 --> 03:17:48,589
TALIESIN: That's an 11 to hit?

2764
03:17:48,589 --> 03:17:51,610
MATT: That's its armor class. Hyena doesn't have a
whole lot of armor.

2765
03:17:51,610 --> 03:17:56,995
TALIESIN: All right, and that's eight points of
damage.

2766
03:17:56,995 --> 03:18:01,369
MATT: Eight points of damage. With the one strike,
you turn around and look at the hyena. (whoosh)

2767
03:18:01,369 --> 03:18:03,013
with the offhand and just carve right through it.

2768
03:18:03,013 --> 03:18:06,006
TRAVIS: With a flourish.

2769
03:18:06,006 --> 03:18:08,548
MATT: Wait, because that didn't have the--

2770
03:18:08,548 --> 03:18:11,144
TALIESIN: No, this one was the glowing one.

2771
03:18:11,144 --> 03:18:13,272
MATT: Well, the glowing one is your main hand.

2772
03:18:13,272 --> 03:18:14,314
TALIESIN: Oh, it was my main hand?

2773
03:18:14,314 --> 03:18:15,864
MATT: Then your offhand is the other one.

2774
03:18:15,864 --> 03:18:17,399
TALIESIN: Oh, okay. I didn't know how that.

2775
03:18:17,399 --> 03:18:20,551
MATT: So what damage would it have been without
the bonus?

2776
03:18:20,551 --> 03:18:22,640
TALIESIN: That would have been four.

2777
03:18:22,640 --> 03:18:27,871
MATT: Four damage? All right, so it's still there.
You carve through, and it's wounded, but it's

2778
03:18:27,871 --> 03:18:29,748
still (whimpering).

2779
03:18:29,748 --> 03:18:30,777
TALIESIN: I would have flipped them if I'd known.

2780
03:18:30,777 --> 03:18:32,222
LAURA: Couldn't you have attacked with your
offhand first?

2781
03:18:32,222 --> 03:18:33,737
TALIESIN: I was going to say, I would have flipped
them if I had known.

2782
03:18:33,737 --> 03:18:34,764
MATT: You could have.

2783
03:18:34,764 --> 03:18:36,285
TALIESIN: I was going to hit the one that didn't
have much left.

2784
03:18:36,285 --> 03:18:40,999
MATT: The idea is the bonus action attack happens
as part of the attack action.

2785
03:18:40,999 --> 03:18:43,393
TALIESIN: Sure, I'll do it reverse next time.

2786
03:18:43,393 --> 03:18:47,786
MATT: No worries, you can keep that in mind next
time. It's all good, you still beat the shit out

2787
03:18:47,786 --> 03:18:55,466
of it with your offhand. So that ends Molly's
turn. Those two gnolls in the back, this guy is

2788
03:18:55,466 --> 03:19:04,469
going to back up as he attempts to make a
dexterity save. Fails! So he falls prone, uses the

2789
03:19:04,469 --> 03:19:10,562
rest of his movement to get back up, so he can
only move ten more feet so he can't get that much

2790
03:19:10,562 --> 03:19:14,303
further away. He's going to go ahead and take a
shot, this guy is going to go ahead and pull back,

2791
03:19:14,303 --> 03:19:18,224
he's out of the bearing range and begins making
his way towards the door.

2792
03:19:18,224 --> 03:19:19,352
MARISHA: No!

2793
03:19:19,352 --> 03:19:24,839
MATT: They're both going to take shots at Fjord.
Actually, one at you, one at Molly. They're not

2794
03:19:24,839 --> 03:19:28,507
going to fire at you because you visibly caught
one and dropped it in front of them like, "Fuck that."

2795
03:19:28,507 --> 03:19:29,865
MARISHA: Aw, damn it!

2796
03:19:29,865 --> 03:19:31,072
TRAVIS: Fuck that!

2797
03:19:31,072 --> 03:19:35,351
MATT: Against Fjord, that's going to be 19.

2798
03:19:35,351 --> 03:19:36,454
TRAVIS: Oh, that hits.

2799
03:19:36,454 --> 03:19:37,544
MATT: And against Molly.

2800
03:19:37,544 --> 03:19:39,559
TALIESIN: Blood Maledict on that fucker.

2801
03:19:39,559 --> 03:19:46,006
MATT: Okay. That brings it down to a 14.

2802
03:19:46,006 --> 03:19:47,170
TALIESIN: Yeah, that don't hit.

2803
03:19:47,170 --> 03:19:51,414
MATT: All right, as the one that is going to fire
at you, Molly, pulls back its arrow, its eyes suddenly go

2804
03:19:51,414 --> 03:19:55,954
dark and begin to bleed from the inside. It
suddenly (snarling) and releases it, and you watch

2805
03:19:55,954 --> 03:19:59,289
as that arrow splinters against the central
column. The one that does come towards you, Fjord,

2806
03:19:59,289 --> 03:20:06,914
however, does strike true. You suffer eight points
of piercing damage as this one catches you right

2807
03:20:06,914 --> 03:20:12,551
in the abdomen, a little bit to the right, tapping
something kidneyish in that vicinity and you feel

2808
03:20:12,551 --> 03:20:18,351
this sudden dull pain and nausea overcome you.
That's going to end the gnolls' turn; Caleb,

2809
03:20:18,351 --> 03:20:19,363
you're up.

2810
03:20:19,363 --> 03:20:26,724
LIAM: I saw Nott dart in front of me and chuckle
to myself, see Nott walk past, I'm going to walk

2811
03:20:26,724 --> 03:20:34,427
forward and say: You are enjoying this too much,
but okay. Can I see these two? You said they were

2812
03:20:34,427 --> 03:20:35,505
backing away, correct?

2813
03:20:35,505 --> 03:20:38,052
MATT: You can see this one. This one is
technically being blocked by that central column.

2814
03:20:38,052 --> 03:20:43,816
LIAM: All right then, the diamond comes up, I spin
it and little charges of electricity crackle

2815
03:20:43,816 --> 03:20:48,756
around it, and I kick it out from my hand and it
spirals through the room to that one.

2816
03:20:48,756 --> 03:20:50,861
MATT: Go ahead and roll your spell attack.

2817
03:20:50,861 --> 03:20:52,677
LIAM: Come on, Grog! No.

2818
03:20:52,677 --> 03:20:56,309
LAURA: Oh man, Caleb, so rough tonight.

2819
03:20:56,309 --> 03:20:57,682
TRAVIS: (as Grog) Sorry.

2820
03:20:57,682 --> 03:20:58,654
MATT: What'd you roll?

2821
03:20:58,654 --> 03:21:00,490
LIAM: Two. Plus six is eight, did that do it?

2822
03:21:00,490 --> 03:21:01,738
MATT: No, unfortunately.

2823
03:21:01,738 --> 03:21:02,733
LIAM: <i>Nein!</i>

2824
03:21:02,733 --> 03:21:08,128
MATT: It skitters off the central column and goes
spinning out of control as the electrical sphere

2825
03:21:08,128 --> 03:21:12,312
shatters against the stonework and dissipates the
energy, absorbed by the surrounding stonework.

2826
03:21:12,312 --> 03:21:17,707
LIAM: But I was so eager that I actually came down
the steps my full movement.

2827
03:21:17,707 --> 03:21:20,324
TALIESIN: I'll also say I think we-- oh no, that's
right, you're double.

2828
03:21:20,324 --> 03:21:24,956
MATT: Yeah, that would be your full movement there.
Pretty close.

2829
03:21:24,956 --> 03:21:29,401
LIAM: I don't want to go there, I want to go to
the bottom of the steps behind Mollymauk and Fjord.

2830
03:21:29,401 --> 03:21:34,627
MATT: Ending Caleb's turn, Beau.

2831
03:21:34,627 --> 03:21:43,521
MARISHA: Right, okay. How far away is he? I'm
having a hard time seeing. Can I close the gap?

2832
03:21:43,521 --> 03:21:48,016
MATT: You could say maybe he's about 30 feet from
you.

2833
03:21:48,069 --> 03:21:56,243
MARISHA: Okay, can I do some cool monk shit and do
some wall running and leap and parkour and then

2834
03:21:56,243 --> 03:21:57,772
get to this guy?

2835
03:21:57,772 --> 03:22:00,647
MATT: You can certainly try. Make an acrobatics
check for me.

2836
03:22:00,647 --> 03:22:01,986
MARISHA: Acrobatics?

2837
03:22:01,986 --> 03:22:06,020
TALIESIN: I can see this is going to end up with
an Office parkour gif in your future.

2838
03:22:06,020 --> 03:22:10,530
MARISHA: Parkour! Oh, that's good! That's a
natural 18 plus six.

2839
03:22:10,530 --> 03:22:15,822
MATT: As you run off the edge, the hyena takes a
swing at you. That is going to be a 14.

2840
03:22:15,822 --> 03:22:16,794
MARISHA: Miss!

2841
03:22:16,794 --> 03:22:21,174
MATT: You feel it snap at your heel, but does not
actually grasp any of your body.

2842
03:22:21,174 --> 03:22:24,469
MARISHA: My foot just taps his arm just a little
bit and I leap off of his arm.

2843
03:22:24,469 --> 03:22:29,002
MATT: You push off of him, run across this wall,
leap, hit this pillar, and then, using the momentum, leap

2844
03:22:29,031 --> 03:22:30,876
and land right in front of the gnoll there.

2845
03:22:30,876 --> 03:22:34,439
MARISHA: As I'm leaping, I want to take the staff
and come down and go (crack) with a slap. Double

2846
03:22:34,439 --> 03:22:43,428
handed, piece of shit gnoll! Oh god, it's a two!

2847
03:22:43,428 --> 03:22:45,243
MATT: What was the other one?

2848
03:22:45,243 --> 03:22:49,397
MARISHA: That was my eight-sided die. I'm trying
to efficient my rolls.

2849
03:22:49,397 --> 03:22:54,883
MATT: Roll both? Yeah. As you swing down, the
gnoll manages to see you up in the air and side

2850
03:22:54,883 --> 03:22:56,891
steps as you hit the stonework.

2851
03:22:56,891 --> 03:22:59,295
MARISHA: I scream as I come down the whole way
going (screaming).

2852
03:22:59,295 --> 03:23:02,896
MATT: (gnoll laughter)

2853
03:23:02,896 --> 03:23:10,178
MARISHA: I just go (pop) and do a little jab,
okay. That's an 18.

2854
03:23:10,178 --> 03:23:13,095
TALIESIN: You just slap him in the face.

2855
03:23:13,095 --> 03:23:17,960
MATT: Damage on that one?

2856
03:23:17,960 --> 03:23:23,054
MARISHA: That's just a d4. Four, so eight!

2857
03:23:23,054 --> 03:23:30,720
MATT: Eight points of damage, nice! As it's
laughing, (laughing, punch, growling) its jaw is

2858
03:23:30,720 --> 03:23:35,276
dislocated and it snaps back into place. You see
some of its teeth broke. It looks kind of dazed

2859
03:23:35,276 --> 03:23:40,581
and hurt by it. It's looking pretty rough; it's
taken some hits in the past. That's the end of

2860
03:23:40,581 --> 03:23:41,874
your turn.

2861
03:23:41,874 --> 03:23:43,350
TALIESIN: He can't run anymore.

2862
03:23:43,350 --> 03:23:46,024
MATT: All right, that brings us to Jester.

2863
03:23:46,024 --> 03:23:51,823
LAURA: I say, "Don't laugh at my friend!" and I'm
going to send my lollipop over and hit it in the face.

2864
03:23:51,823 --> 03:23:56,119
MATT: Yeah, that'll do it, 20 feet.

2865
03:23:56,119 --> 03:23:59,758
MARISHA: Get a good hit, lollipop!

2866
03:23:59,758 --> 03:24:02,953
LAURA: I don't know if it's going to hit it. Eight
plus five.

2867
03:24:02,953 --> 03:24:07,679
MATT: 13? No, I'm afraid that will not hit. As the
lollipop comes around the corner, it sees it

2868
03:24:07,679 --> 03:24:13,656
coming, and moves to get Beau to intercede between
the lollipop and itself. At that moment, you're like,

2869
03:24:13,656 --> 03:24:18,481
"Oh, I can't quite--," and you end up withdrawing
and not making the strike this round for fear of hitting Beau.

2870
03:24:18,538 --> 03:24:19,982
LAURA: Toll the Dead!

2871
03:24:19,982 --> 03:24:26,763
MATT: All righty, so that's a wisdom save? That's
six, no!

2872
03:24:26,763 --> 03:24:33,615
LAURA: Yay! Okay, seven.

2873
03:24:33,615 --> 03:24:40,854
MATT: Seven points of damage. As you release the
surge of energy, the sound begins to vibrate

2874
03:24:40,854 --> 03:24:47,399
in its ears as it (whimpering) and it reaches up
as both of its eardrums burst on the sides of its

2875
03:24:47,399 --> 03:24:52,659
head and it falls to one knee looking like it's
completely ruined and dazed. And Beau, you have a

2876
03:24:52,659 --> 03:25:00,151
moment to coup de grâce it. You (whack) and break
its neck with one swoop of the bo. Combined, you

2877
03:25:00,151 --> 03:25:01,705
both finish off that gnoll.

2878
03:25:01,705 --> 03:25:02,611
MARISHA: Sounds great.

2879
03:25:02,611 --> 03:25:04,505
TALIESIN: That's so cool. That spell is so cool.

2880
03:25:04,505 --> 03:25:05,627
LAURA: It's pretty cool.

2881
03:25:05,627 --> 03:25:07,760
MARISHA: Fuck yeah, that was awesome.

2882
03:25:07,760 --> 03:25:09,628
TRAVIS: Toll the Dead is the bomb!

2883
03:25:09,628 --> 03:25:10,781
MATT: Jester, you want to move?

2884
03:25:10,781 --> 03:25:12,963
LAURA: I'm going to hang out where I am.

2885
03:25:12,963 --> 03:25:20,033
MATT: Okay. End of Jester's turn. The hyenas. This
hyena is going to move past--

2886
03:25:20,033 --> 03:25:22,501
TALIESIN: Does Fjord get an attack of opportunity
on it?

2887
03:25:22,501 --> 03:25:26,341
MATT: No, that one was not in melee with
him. That one's going to move up to you, Fjord.

2888
03:25:26,341 --> 03:25:30,429
Attacking you, Fjord, that is a six.

2889
03:25:30,429 --> 03:25:32,236
TRAVIS: No, it doesn't hit! Thankfully.

2890
03:25:32,236 --> 03:25:34,378
MATT: Attacking you, Molly. That is a 20.

2891
03:25:34,378 --> 03:25:36,102
TALIESIN: That hits.

2892
03:25:36,102 --> 03:25:48,345
MATT: You take two points of piercing damage as it
snaps at you. Seeing that they're both beginning

2893
03:25:48,345 --> 03:25:55,966
to glance about and see that their allies are
starting to back away, and there's a lot of you up

2894
03:25:55,966 --> 03:25:58,845
in this upper area, they're both going to attempt
to break away with the rest--

2895
03:25:58,845 --> 03:26:02,180
TALIESIN: I'm definitely going to take an attack
of opportunity on that one.

2896
03:26:02,180 --> 03:26:03,295
TRAVIS: I'd like to, as well.

2897
03:26:03,295 --> 03:26:04,293
MATT: Yep, both of you do.

2898
03:26:04,293 --> 03:26:06,392
LAURA: We got to get that last gnoll before he
leaves the room.

2899
03:26:06,392 --> 03:26:11,167
TALIESIN: 14?

2900
03:26:11,167 --> 03:26:12,297
TRAVIS: 21.

2901
03:26:12,297 --> 03:26:13,666
MATT: Both hit. Roll damage.

2902
03:26:13,666 --> 03:26:14,841
TALIESIN: Is this main hand?

2903
03:26:14,841 --> 03:26:18,873
MATT: Main hand. This one is hanging on by a
thread. It's the one you damaged last round.

2904
03:26:18,873 --> 03:26:21,607
TALIESIN: Eight points of damage.

2905
03:26:21,607 --> 03:26:22,819
MATT: Yeah, you carve that one. You?

2906
03:26:22,819 --> 03:26:23,974
TRAVIS: 11 points.

2907
03:26:23,974 --> 03:26:28,111
MATT: As they're rushing, you both (whoosh)
simultaneously strike back at it as they're

2908
03:26:28,111 --> 03:26:29,861
attempting to flee and they stumble down the
stairs.

2909
03:26:29,861 --> 03:26:30,794
TRAVIS: Can we cheers swords?

2910
03:26:30,794 --> 03:26:32,369
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: Tink.

2911
03:26:32,369 --> 03:26:36,275
MATT: Perfect. Their bodies stumble to the ground
and end up-- it's weird because their bodies hit

2912
03:26:36,275 --> 03:26:40,706
the ground, and the momentum carries them as they
slide across the ball bearings, almost like

2913
03:26:40,706 --> 03:26:42,052
they're lagging.

2914
03:26:42,052 --> 03:26:43,769
MARISHA: Bad physics?

2915
03:26:43,769 --> 03:26:46,240
TRAVIS: What's that-- kerning? Curling.

2916
03:26:46,240 --> 03:26:52,874
MATT: Finished the hyenas' round. Nott, you're
up.

2917
03:26:52,874 --> 03:27:01,486
SAM: Seeing the gnoll's expression, I know it
well. It's one of fear and about to run away.

2918
03:27:01,486 --> 03:27:03,253
(laughter)

2919
03:27:03,253 --> 03:27:04,425
MATT: Make an insight check.

2920
03:27:04,425 --> 03:27:05,648
SAM: Okay.

2921
03:27:05,648 --> 03:27:06,984
TALIESIN: At disadvantage?

2922
03:27:06,984 --> 03:27:07,864
SAM: 19.

2923
03:27:07,864 --> 03:27:13,446
MATT: It is not disadvantage on wisdom checks. 19.
This gnoll looks like it's ready to fucking bolt.

2924
03:27:13,446 --> 03:27:17,352
It is on the way out of the room. The tide has
turned, it's starting to see more and more of you

2925
03:27:17,352 --> 03:27:20,462
appear at the top of the stairs as the hyenas and
its friends are being destroyed. It's going to run.

2926
03:27:20,462 --> 03:27:27,080
SAM: Okay. I'm going to put the hand crossbow up
and run as fast as I can, straight at it. Using my

2927
03:27:27,080 --> 03:27:41,054
bonus action to dash, I'm going to say to it: Hey,
you! If you spend all day in a well, well, that's a

2928
03:27:41,054 --> 03:27:45,360
day well-spent! I'll cast Hideous Laughter on it.

2929
03:27:45,360 --> 03:27:49,036
(laughter)

2930
03:27:49,036 --> 03:27:51,839
LAURA: I'm glad we still get shitty jokes.

2931
03:27:51,839 --> 03:28:01,923
MATT: It immediately goes (cackling) and falls on
the ground, on its back, and is now rolling with

2932
03:28:01,923 --> 03:28:05,721
laughter. Laughter that is echoing through the
halls and making its way through the tunnel.

2933
03:28:05,721 --> 03:28:11,015
SAM: Don't you worry. Fjord, kill him!

2934
03:28:11,015 --> 03:28:13,769
TRAVIS: You made it prone; it's harder to hit
that way!

2935
03:28:13,769 --> 03:28:16,010
SAM: Get closer!

2936
03:28:16,010 --> 03:28:22,140
TRAVIS: I'm trying! I would like to move up my 30
feet of speed.

2937
03:28:22,140 --> 03:28:28,108
MARISHA: I turn behind me, I go: Watch the ball
bearings! Watch the marbles!

2938
03:28:28,108 --> 03:28:29,364
MATT: Make a dexterity saving throw.

2939
03:28:29,364 --> 03:28:30,295
MARISHA: Shit.

2940
03:28:30,295 --> 03:28:31,708
MATT: As you hear that just as you reach the
bottom of the stairs.

2941
03:28:31,708 --> 03:28:34,656
TRAVIS: 13.

2942
03:28:34,656 --> 03:28:37,695
MATT: Okay, you get to the bottom of the stairs,
and you barely begin to slip and catch yourself.

2943
03:28:37,695 --> 03:28:46,856
It's a DC 12. However, you continue to run.
(counting) That's about as close as you can get on

2944
03:28:46,856 --> 03:28:47,842
your 30 movement--

2945
03:28:47,842 --> 03:28:50,714
TRAVIS: Can I use my bonus action to move my Hex
to the laughing gnoll on the ground?

2946
03:28:50,714 --> 03:28:51,856
MATT: Yes, you may.

2947
03:28:51,856 --> 03:28:54,199
TRAVIS: I'll cast Eldritch Blast at it.

2948
03:28:54,199 --> 03:28:57,274
MATT: Actually, make a concentration check. You've
taken some damage, and I forgot to maintain your

2949
03:28:57,274 --> 03:28:58,686
Hex's concentration.

2950
03:28:58,686 --> 03:29:01,846
TRAVIS: Oh. That's right. Saving throw?

2951
03:29:01,846 --> 03:29:03,299
MATT: Make two for me, if you don't mind.

2952
03:29:03,299 --> 03:29:04,999
TRAVIS: This first one is a 19.

2953
03:29:04,999 --> 03:29:06,381
MATT: Correct. That's fine.

2954
03:29:06,381 --> 03:29:07,835
TRAVIS: The second one is 18.

2955
03:29:07,835 --> 03:29:09,903
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. The Hex moves over--

2956
03:29:09,903 --> 03:29:11,748
TRAVIS: I'll remember that.

2957
03:29:11,748 --> 03:29:13,512
MATT: Whenever you take damage, and you have a
spell that's concentration, you have to--

2958
03:29:13,512 --> 03:29:14,925
TRAVIS: These spell rules.

2959
03:29:14,925 --> 03:29:16,073
MATT: I know.

2960
03:29:16,073 --> 03:29:20,770
TRAVIS: 14.

2961
03:29:20,770 --> 03:29:21,794
MATT: Eldritch Blast?

2962
03:29:21,794 --> 03:29:23,443
TRAVIS: Yes. Oh, sorry, plus six.

2963
03:29:23,443 --> 03:29:25,216
MATT: Disadvantage. Because it's still prone.

2964
03:29:25,216 --> 03:29:28,191
TRAVIS: That's even higher, so 14.

2965
03:29:28,191 --> 03:29:35,816
MATT: 14? Still misses, unfortunately. It hits and
gleans off of its armor. However, it isn't quite

2966
03:29:35,816 --> 03:29:40,092
strong enough to actually make a painful impact on
its body and slams into the nearby rock, causing a

2967
03:29:40,092 --> 03:29:42,214
spray of dust and debris.

2968
03:29:42,214 --> 03:29:44,780
TRAVIS: The attack has to hit for Hex to work,
right?

2969
03:29:44,780 --> 03:29:49,053
MATT: Correct. All right. That ends your turn,
Fjord. Molly, you're up.

2970
03:29:49,053 --> 03:29:54,990
TALIESIN: I'm going to run down the stairs the
opposite direction from the ball bearings. I'll

2971
03:29:54,990 --> 03:29:56,607
see where I can get, if I can get 30 feet.

2972
03:29:56,607 --> 03:29:58,054
MATT: That's as far as you can get, right there.

2973
03:29:58,054 --> 03:30:04,201
TALIESIN: I'm going to also use Vicious Mockery
again and yell: Shut up already!

2974
03:30:04,201 --> 03:30:07,952
MATT: That actually is a 16. What's your DC?

2975
03:30:07,952 --> 03:30:11,507
TALIESIN: DC on that, it just says wisdom saving.

2976
03:30:11,507 --> 03:30:13,944
MATT: Right. Against whatever your spell DC is.

2977
03:30:13,944 --> 03:30:20,280
TALIESIN: Where is my spell DC? Well, it's weird,
I'm not a spell--

2978
03:30:20,280 --> 03:30:24,033
MATT: Spellcaster technically. We will say for
the purposes of this it's eight plus proficiency

2979
03:30:24,033 --> 03:30:27,342
bonus which is ten plus whatever your charisma
modifier is.

2980
03:30:27,342 --> 03:30:29,253
TALIESIN: My charisma modifier is zero.

2981
03:30:29,253 --> 03:30:30,419
SAM: Yuck.

2982
03:30:30,419 --> 03:30:38,604
MATT: Yeah. Not a big deal. For now. We'll tighten
it up. Cool. So no effect there. Molly's turn is

2983
03:30:38,604 --> 03:30:42,931
over. The gnoll's turn. It is laughing its ass
off. Now does it make--

2984
03:30:42,931 --> 03:30:46,621
SAM: The end of its turn it makes a save.

2985
03:30:46,621 --> 03:30:51,321
MATT: All right. Which is a 17. It manages to
shrug off the laughter.

2986
03:30:51,321 --> 03:30:53,281
SAM: At the end of its turn.

2987
03:30:53,281 --> 03:30:55,854
LAURA: Oh, so it can't get up and move.

2988
03:30:55,854 --> 03:31:01,538
MATT: No. It's just on the ground going (confused
whimpering). It's about to try and get back up.

2989
03:31:01,538 --> 03:31:03,193
Caleb, you're up.

2990
03:31:03,193 --> 03:31:10,982
LIAM: I'm going to go along the edge of the steps
this way and come down toward it and I'm going to

2991
03:31:10,982 --> 03:31:17,119
now spin and flames lick around it and I'll go
(flick) and I flick that off my hand. This time is

2992
03:31:17,119 --> 03:31:21,150
also not good. It is a 13.

2993
03:31:21,150 --> 03:31:23,386
MATT: 13. It has disadvantage because it's still
prone.

2994
03:31:23,386 --> 03:31:24,999
LIAM: Oh. For my attack?

2995
03:31:24,999 --> 03:31:27,246
MATT: Yes. Against ranged spells.

2996
03:31:27,246 --> 03:31:28,578
LIAM: Same thing. Rolled the same thing.

2997
03:31:28,578 --> 03:31:33,690
MATT: Yeah, you release it and it just skids
across the ground. Like skipping a stone across a

2998
03:31:33,690 --> 03:31:36,468
lake. It slams into the wall behind it and
(explosion).

2999
03:31:36,468 --> 03:31:38,506
TRAVIS: I apologize.

3000
03:31:38,506 --> 03:31:43,479
LIAM: No, it's okay. No, I don't believe in any of
that bullshit. You all are crazy.

3001
03:31:43,479 --> 03:31:50,518
MATT: It's all good, man. Just survive to level
five and everything will turn. Unfortunately it

3002
03:31:50,518 --> 03:31:51,486
does not hit.

3003
03:31:51,486 --> 03:31:53,262
LIAM: No, don't worry about me. Keep going.
Everybody attack.

3004
03:31:53,262 --> 03:31:54,447
MATT: All right. Beau, you're up.

3005
03:31:54,447 --> 03:32:01,757
MARISHA: I want to do this as my two-handed
attack, but for flavor to skin it. I want to

3006
03:32:01,757 --> 03:32:11,422
stroll up, channeling The Rock. Charge up the
elbow. Then we go a People's Elbow. Come right down.

3007
03:32:11,422 --> 03:32:13,143
MATT: You have advantage because it is prone.

3008
03:32:13,143 --> 03:32:20,070
MARISHA: Just a full body weight (thudding). With
advantage? Can I consider it a two-handed attack?

3009
03:32:20,070 --> 03:32:24,027
MATT: You're just getting your attack, so yeah,
still with advantage.

3010
03:32:24,027 --> 03:32:28,208
MARISHA: Oh my god! Why?!

3011
03:32:28,208 --> 03:32:29,653
LIAM: Two and a three.

3012
03:32:29,653 --> 03:32:37,247
MATT: Here's what you do. You walk up. Tap tap.
Leap and right as you're in the air the gnoll

3013
03:32:37,247 --> 03:32:41,769
kicks out of laughter. Rolls out of the way and
you wham!

3014
03:32:41,769 --> 03:32:44,377
MARISHA: (yelling in pain)

3015
03:32:44,377 --> 03:32:47,489
LIAM: Never recover from that injury.

3016
03:32:47,489 --> 03:32:49,235
TRAVIS: Yep, that shit just hangs out in there.

3017
03:32:49,235 --> 03:32:58,892
MATT: The worst funny bone pain shoots through
your arm as you get up.

3018
03:32:58,892 --> 03:33:02,923
LIAM: You are going to be rubbing Tiger Balm into
that shit for years.

3019
03:33:02,923 --> 03:33:08,606
MATT: You still have your bonus. The gnoll actually
starts laughing again.

3020
03:33:08,606 --> 03:33:16,789
MARISHA: For flavor, my second attack isn't really
an attack. I'm in so much pain I go (yell) and I

3021
03:33:16,789 --> 03:33:18,197
kick a little bit.

3022
03:33:18,197 --> 03:33:21,998
MATT: Roll the attack. You still have advantage.
Yeah, because it's still prone.

3023
03:33:21,998 --> 03:33:24,782
MARISHA: Natural 20!

3024
03:33:24,782 --> 03:33:27,324
MATT: That will shut it up.

3025
03:33:27,324 --> 03:33:33,860
LAURA: I like that your revenge hits are always
really high. That's twice now that they've

3026
03:33:33,860 --> 03:33:36,694
laughed at you and you've hit them while they're
laughing at you.

3027
03:33:36,694 --> 03:33:41,863
MARISHA: Every time I try to show off it never
works. That's what I'm learning. Okay, three

3028
03:33:41,863 --> 03:33:44,835
doubled to six plus four. So ten.

3029
03:33:44,835 --> 03:33:51,483
MATT: So as it's laughing, you kick it in the head
and you see it stunned on the ground for a second

3030
03:33:51,483 --> 03:33:55,833
and its eyes kind of rolling in different
directions. Nice heavy crack to the side of its temple.

3031
03:33:55,833 --> 03:33:59,095
MARISHA: I don't care too much. I just roll over
and go fetal for a minute.

3032
03:33:59,095 --> 03:34:04,592
MATT: Okay, ending Beau's turn. Jester, you're
up.

3033
03:34:04,592 --> 03:34:13,968
LAURA: I'm going to skip over across the upper
level towards the far stairs so I can see it. I'm

3034
03:34:13,968 --> 03:34:18,465
going to send my Spiritual Weapon over to it and
smack it flat on the ground!

3035
03:34:18,465 --> 03:34:21,572
MATT: Okay, that does have advantage because it is
technically in melee with it.

3036
03:34:21,572 --> 03:34:33,487
LAURA: Jesus Christ, I don't think either of them
hit. 13 and lower.

3037
03:34:33,487 --> 03:34:38,680
MATT: Nope. It's just rolling out of the way of
everything. It's doing what Beau did in the last

3038
03:34:38,680 --> 03:34:40,322
fight, but on the ground.

3039
03:34:40,322 --> 03:34:46,997
LAURA: Then I'm going to Toll the Dead. Wisdom.

3040
03:34:46,997 --> 03:34:48,895
MATT: Unless it rolls a natural 19.

3041
03:34:48,895 --> 03:34:51,351
TALIESIN: This is amazing!

3042
03:34:51,351 --> 03:34:57,926
MATT: This one gnoll is just holding on so hard.
Jester, I think that ends your turn, unfortunately.

3043
03:34:57,926 --> 03:34:59,709
LAURA: Jesus fucking Christ.

3044
03:34:59,709 --> 03:35:02,649
(laughter)

3045
03:35:02,649 --> 03:35:04,683
MATT: The hyenas are dead. There's no hyenas
left.

3046
03:35:04,683 --> 03:35:08,709
TRAVIS: The proned-out gnoll is just making it
through.

3047
03:35:08,709 --> 03:35:10,701
MARISHA: Come on, Nott. Bring it home!

3048
03:35:10,701 --> 03:35:14,809
LAURA: I'm going to sit down on the ground and--
all my Mirror Images do the exact same thing.

3049
03:35:14,809 --> 03:35:21,173
MATT: You watch as four shimmering Jesters all
kneel down and shake their heads in their hands.

3050
03:35:21,173 --> 03:35:24,005
Beau is over there going (gasps).

3051
03:35:24,005 --> 03:35:27,060
MARISHA: It's almost something like a Jacob's
Ladder moment, the end of his life is being

3052
03:35:27,060 --> 03:35:29,064
stretched out.

3053
03:35:29,064 --> 03:35:31,767
MATT: This gnoll is going to need some serious
therapy. Nott, you're up.

3054
03:35:31,767 --> 03:35:38,376
SAM: I can't believe this thing is still alive.
It's still prone, right?

3055
03:35:38,376 --> 03:35:40,528
MATT: It's prone, yeah, so melee attacks have
advantage.

3056
03:35:40,528 --> 03:35:44,904
SAM: So I walk up to it, and then point-blank
shoot-- not point-blank, but far enough away that--

3057
03:35:44,904 --> 03:35:47,491
MATT: You're at disadvantage with a ranged
attack.

3058
03:35:47,491 --> 03:35:48,759
SAM: All right, I'll stand back ten feet.

3059
03:35:48,759 --> 03:35:50,659
TALIESIN: No, you'll still get disadvantage.

3060
03:35:50,659 --> 03:35:53,421
MATT: You have disadvantage from a ranged attack
up close and disadvantage against a prone

3061
03:35:53,421 --> 03:35:55,806
creature. Right now, with your crossbow, it's
disadvantage regardless.

3062
03:35:55,806 --> 03:35:59,701
SAM: Oh, well shit. Then I will draw a sword and I
will--

3063
03:35:59,701 --> 03:36:01,496
TRAVIS: Slap that bitch!

3064
03:36:01,496 --> 03:36:03,235
TALIESIN: Now you've got advantage.

3065
03:36:03,235 --> 03:36:04,386
MATT: Now you have advantage on the attack.

3066
03:36:04,386 --> 03:36:05,598
TRAVIS: Get your hands dirty.

3067
03:36:05,598 --> 03:36:08,062
SAM: Thank god. Okay, 18.

3068
03:36:08,062 --> 03:36:12,874
MATT: 18 hits. Go ahead and roll damage with your
sneak attack.

3069
03:36:12,874 --> 03:36:16,039
SAM: Okay, 13.

3070
03:36:16,039 --> 03:36:19,962
MATT: 13 points of damage. How do you want to do
this?

3071
03:36:19,962 --> 03:36:23,158
(cheers)

3072
03:36:23,158 --> 03:36:31,920
SAM: I think, since it's on the ground, I would
like to pin it into the ground, if I can, by

3073
03:36:31,920 --> 03:36:36,453
finding the thinnest thing on it and jamming my
shortsword into the ground.

3074
03:36:36,453 --> 03:36:39,888
MATT: As it's cackling and moving around, I like
to imagine this is all happening simultaneously.

3075
03:36:39,888 --> 03:36:44,487
Beau's on the ground holding her elbow, the weapon
misses, and it's rolling and cackling and starting

3076
03:36:44,487 --> 03:36:52,820
to get up and you're like "Hmm, there!" (thump)
Almost unceremoniously it's like (dying yip) and

3077
03:36:52,820 --> 03:36:59,156
falls limp on the ground where you place it. It's
almost like the slow push from Saving Private

3078
03:36:59,156 --> 03:37:00,916
Ryan. You're like, "Shh, shh, shh."

3079
03:37:00,916 --> 03:37:02,254
LAURA: You're terrible.

3080
03:37:02,254 --> 03:37:08,286
MATT: (dying yips) and it expires there on the
ground.

3081
03:37:08,286 --> 03:37:12,365
LAURA: I go around and I collect the gnoll ears
and I put them in the jar.

3082
03:37:12,365 --> 03:37:22,447
LIAM: As the room falls still, I say: Well, he had
a good run. A toast to that guy right there on the ground.

3083
03:37:22,447 --> 03:37:25,170
SAM: Yes.

3084
03:37:25,170 --> 03:37:27,145
TALIESIN: Cheers.

3085
03:37:27,145 --> 03:37:33,439
SAM: He was like Beyoncé. He was one hot Knowles.

3086
03:37:33,439 --> 03:37:36,672
(laughter and groaning)

3087
03:37:36,672 --> 03:37:40,583
SAM: I don't know!

3088
03:37:40,583 --> 03:37:42,906
TRAVIS: One point of damage? All of us?

3089
03:37:42,906 --> 03:37:44,805
MATT: Everyone takes one point of psychic damage.

3090
03:37:44,805 --> 03:37:51,486
LAURA: I have a question. How similar do hyena
ears look to gnoll ears?

3091
03:37:51,486 --> 03:37:54,954
MATT: They are noticeably smaller and not gnoll
ears.

3092
03:37:54,954 --> 03:37:59,842
LAURA: What if we said they were baby gnolls? I'm
going to cut them off just to be safe.

3093
03:37:59,842 --> 03:38:08,893
MATT: Okay. Five sets of gnoll ears and four sets
of hyena ears.

3094
03:38:08,893 --> 03:38:16,058
LIAM: I'm going to call Nott over to the chest
over on that side there. Do you see anything wrong

3095
03:38:16,058 --> 03:38:19,624
with this? Is there anything hinky about that
chest?

3096
03:38:19,624 --> 03:38:22,936
SAM: I check for traps. Checking for traps.

3097
03:38:22,936 --> 03:38:24,191
MATT: All right.

3098
03:38:24,191 --> 03:38:26,300
SAM: This is an intelligence check?

3099
03:38:26,300 --> 03:38:27,501
TRAVIS: Are you still intoxicated?

3100
03:38:27,501 --> 03:38:28,843
LIAM: It's investigation, I think.

3101
03:38:28,843 --> 03:38:30,388
TRAVIS: Or has that shit worn off with some
activity?

3102
03:38:30,388 --> 03:38:37,245
MATT: The next ten to 15 minutes or so, you'll be
able to shake off the alcohol.

3103
03:38:37,245 --> 03:38:40,113
SAM: For now, I rolled an 11.

3104
03:38:40,113 --> 03:38:42,187
MATT: Okay. It does not appear to be trapped.

3105
03:38:42,187 --> 03:38:43,159
SAM: It's good!

3106
03:38:43,159 --> 03:38:44,109
LIAM: Does it look good?

3107
03:38:44,109 --> 03:38:45,689
SAM: It's totally good.

3108
03:38:45,689 --> 03:38:48,879
LIAM: Take a step back. You've earned this. I will
open it, just in case.

3109
03:38:48,879 --> 03:38:50,656
MATT: (clunk) It's locked.

3110
03:38:50,656 --> 03:38:51,492
LIAM: Oh.

3111
03:38:51,492 --> 03:38:54,661
SAM: I will pick it!

3112
03:38:54,661 --> 03:38:59,762
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and attempt, with
disadvantage, to pick it.

3113
03:38:59,762 --> 03:39:01,379
SAM: What am I rolling?

3114
03:39:01,379 --> 03:39:05,597
MATT: It's proficiency bonus, which is two, plus
your dex bonus.

3115
03:39:05,597 --> 03:39:15,472
SAM: Okay. Proficiency and dex. But disadvantage.
Okay. 21.

3116
03:39:15,472 --> 03:39:21,786
MATT: As the adrenaline pumps through your system,
it wakes you up a bit and even with the

3117
03:39:21,786 --> 03:39:26,987
intoxication that's been flooding your system, you
steal a moment of clarity and it opens without an

3118
03:39:26,987 --> 03:39:32,187
issue. You glance at it, and the chest looks like
it's been bashed in a little bit, like one of the

3119
03:39:32,187 --> 03:39:36,634
gnolls was trying to get into it and eventually
gave up, got flummoxed, and threw it on the

3120
03:39:36,634 --> 03:39:47,177
ground. As you open it up from the inside, you can
see essentially a central medical pack, if you

3121
03:39:47,177 --> 03:39:52,147
will. An emergency pack for any of the miners that
had gotten hurt or wounded. There are two healer's

3122
03:39:52,147 --> 03:40:01,536
kits in there. There are a number of disinfectant
herbs and funguses. Anybody who is proficient in

3123
03:40:01,536 --> 03:40:05,086
medicine would know how best to utilize those. I
don't know if any of you are.

3124
03:40:05,086 --> 03:40:07,680
TRAVIS: Nope.

3125
03:40:07,680 --> 03:40:18,194
MATT: Then it's a risky endeavor to maybe use one.
You do find a small leather hand pack that

3126
03:40:18,194 --> 03:40:25,150
contained four glass vials, three of which were
shattered from the rough movements when it was

3127
03:40:25,150 --> 03:40:28,852
tossed around, but one that is still intact. That
contains a healing potion.

3128
03:40:28,852 --> 03:40:30,838
SAM: Is it a healing potion?

3129
03:40:30,838 --> 03:40:38,544
MATT: It is. It is a greater healing potion, not a
standard healing potion.

3130
03:40:38,544 --> 03:40:40,817
LAURA: Whoa!

3131
03:40:40,817 --> 03:40:49,871
SAM: I hand it to Caleb. You need this more than
all of us. You're the squishiest.

3132
03:40:49,871 --> 03:40:55,851
LIAM: Well, that's probably true. Thank you. You
take the two medicine packs and then--

3133
03:40:55,851 --> 03:40:59,621
SAM: What do I do with these? I don't, all right
fine, I'll take them. I collect medicine packs now.

3134
03:40:59,621 --> 03:41:02,993
LAURA: I need them. I could probably use those.

3135
03:41:02,993 --> 03:41:06,838
TALIESIN: I also like the idea of maybe giving the
healing potion to the healer.

3136
03:41:06,838 --> 03:41:10,373
LIAM: She can heal without the potion.

3137
03:41:10,373 --> 03:41:12,298
TALIESIN: Can you heal yourself without the
potion?

3138
03:41:12,298 --> 03:41:13,623
LIAM: Of course she can.

3139
03:41:13,623 --> 03:41:15,834
TALIESIN: Oh, well all right then. That didn't
really occur to me.

3140
03:41:15,834 --> 03:41:17,500
SAM: I'll keep the herbs.

3141
03:41:17,500 --> 03:41:29,505
MATT: You can mark down medicinal supplies, would
be what you'd call it. You are not entirely certain

3142
03:41:29,505 --> 03:41:33,421
as to how they are applied, but they are probably
healthy.

3143
03:41:33,421 --> 03:41:34,891
LAURA: Can I look at them since I'm proficient in
medicine?

3144
03:41:34,891 --> 03:41:38,082
MATT: You're proficient in medicine? Yeah. I was
asking if anyone was proficient with it.

3145
03:41:38,082 --> 03:41:40,648
LAURA: Oh, sorry. I was writing down gnoll sets of
ears.

3146
03:41:40,648 --> 03:41:50,383
MATT: (laughs) Fair enough. The medicinal supplies
you have acquired can be utilized to remove

3147
03:41:50,383 --> 03:41:59,441
poisons, if quickly applied to where the poison
was put. It has two uses. If an action is taken to

3148
03:41:59,441 --> 03:42:05,124
apply it to a wound, whether a bite or a wound
that was poisoned, it can help remove the poison.

3149
03:42:05,124 --> 03:42:06,163
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

3150
03:42:06,163 --> 03:42:08,038
LAURA: It's an action you said?

3151
03:42:08,038 --> 03:42:09,097
MATT: It's an action to apply it, yeah.

3152
03:42:09,097 --> 03:42:16,748
LIAM: There was a lot of gnoll chatter in here,
and a lot of exploding orbs and stuff, so I'm

3153
03:42:16,748 --> 03:42:24,617
going to guess that we have alerted whatever is
beyond that we are here. How do we wish to proceed?

3154
03:42:24,617 --> 03:42:27,092
TALIESIN: Well, they make a lot of noise. They may
not have noticed.

3155
03:42:27,092 --> 03:42:35,830
MARISHA: Can I, since I'm in that general
vicinity, go 20 or so feet into this hole and

3156
03:42:35,830 --> 03:42:37,951
listen and see if I hear anything?

3157
03:42:37,951 --> 03:42:43,031
LIAM: They don't send orbs of fire through the
air, though.

3158
03:42:43,031 --> 03:42:46,620
MATT: As you step forward a little bit, make a
perception check.

3159
03:42:46,620 --> 03:42:50,864
LAURA: What was the question? I'm sorry.

3160
03:42:50,864 --> 03:42:52,179
TRAVIS: There was no question.

3161
03:42:52,179 --> 03:42:54,123
MARISHA: 13.

3162
03:42:54,123 --> 03:43:08,041
MATT: You hear echoing, muffled in the distance.
Some yipping, some conversation in whatever this

3163
03:43:08,041 --> 03:43:17,865
gnollish language is. You hear a deep, resonant
(deep breathing) and a distant (thump). An impact,

3164
03:43:17,865 --> 03:43:26,305
and a sound near (yips). That's all. Sounded quite
a ways away, like this echo had been traveling a

3165
03:43:26,305 --> 03:43:28,090
ways down this tunnel.

3166
03:43:28,090 --> 03:43:31,052
MARISHA: I bend down--

3167
03:43:31,052 --> 03:43:36,116
MATT: You hear a few other cackling chuckles that
echo shortly thereafter.

3168
03:43:36,116 --> 03:43:43,266
MARISHA: I turn around and come back to the rest
of the group and say: There's something bigger.

3169
03:43:43,266 --> 03:43:48,968
TRAVIS: Jester, could you give me a heal a little
bit? I took a little bit of a beating.

3170
03:43:48,968 --> 03:43:52,890
LAURA: Oh sure. Yeah, I'll cast Cure Wounds on
him.

3171
03:43:52,890 --> 03:44:03,717
MARISHA: I think there's something bigger at play
here. Whatever is driving these gnolls I think is

3172
03:44:03,717 --> 03:44:16,489
deeper in. Can I look around and see if I can find
anything like any papers, anything from that

3173
03:44:16,489 --> 03:44:19,297
humanoid that might be intelligible?

3174
03:44:19,297 --> 03:44:22,107
MATT: Make an investigation check, please.

3175
03:44:22,107 --> 03:44:28,573
MARISHA: Okay, 20 total.

3176
03:44:28,573 --> 03:44:39,767
MATT: Okay. Looking about the altar, you find some
smaller pieces of fresher flesh that have been

3177
03:44:39,767 --> 03:44:45,137
stretched over the edges of the altar, like on the
corners. You can see a similar grin across the

3178
03:44:45,137 --> 03:44:48,958
center. It's all blood splattered from the hearts
that were placed on there. As you wipe a little

3179
03:44:48,958 --> 03:44:56,853
bit of it away, you can see stained into this
loosely tanned human skin the same symbol of the

3180
03:44:56,853 --> 03:45:03,085
jagged smile. The jagged teeth that form a grin
that the various tanned banners that are stapled

3181
03:45:03,085 --> 03:45:09,033
into the stone walls show and reveal. But no
notes. No books, no parchment.

3182
03:45:09,033 --> 03:45:15,223
MARISHA: Can I try and figure out what this is, if
I recognize this symbol in any way?

3183
03:45:15,223 --> 03:45:17,556
TALIESIN: I'd also like to join in on that with a
religion check.

3184
03:45:17,556 --> 03:45:23,850
MATT: You've already made a religion check before,
and as you come up and join her, this particular

3185
03:45:23,850 --> 03:45:28,750
symbol, the grin matches the memory, the flash you
had of this entity.

3186
03:45:28,750 --> 03:45:30,537
MARISHA: Yeenogru?

3187
03:45:30,537 --> 03:45:31,601
LAURA: Yeah, Yeenoghu.

3188
03:45:31,601 --> 03:45:32,707
MARISHA: Yeenoghu?

3189
03:45:32,707 --> 03:45:35,666
MATT: You gather this is probably the symbol
that represents this entity.

3190
03:45:35,717 --> 03:45:37,120
TALIESIN: The cult of Yeenogru.

3191
03:45:37,120 --> 03:45:38,390
LAURA: Yeenogru or Yeenoghu?

3192
03:45:38,390 --> 03:45:39,772
MARISHA: Yeenoghu or what?

3193
03:45:39,772 --> 03:45:40,884
MATT and MARISHA: Yeenoghu.

3194
03:45:40,884 --> 03:45:45,788
TALIESIN: Mr. Magoo. Well, you know. Fake
confidence.

3195
03:45:45,788 --> 03:45:47,314
LIAM: Are you clear now?

3196
03:45:47,314 --> 03:45:48,973
SAM: I'm fine.

3197
03:45:48,973 --> 03:45:50,765
LIAM: How many fingers am I holding up?

3198
03:45:50,765 --> 03:45:57,056
SAM: More than I think I have on my entire body. I
think I just have four on each hand.

3199
03:45:57,056 --> 03:46:01,434
LIAM: And thumbs? Or--?

3200
03:46:01,434 --> 03:46:04,563
(laughter)

3201
03:46:04,563 --> 03:46:08,595
LIAM: You good? Do we need to get out of here?

3202
03:46:08,595 --> 03:46:21,350
SAM: Yeah. I'm good. We're fine. I mean, is this
the plan? We were supposed to free living people,

3203
03:46:21,350 --> 03:46:23,677
but we got some arms. We could bring those back.

3204
03:46:23,677 --> 03:46:26,127
LIAM: I don't think, I mean, yeah, we could,
but--

3205
03:46:26,127 --> 03:46:28,824
LAURA: He did say to bring back anything we could
find.

3206
03:46:28,895 --> 03:46:31,246
SAM: Are there any identifiable body parts?

3207
03:46:31,246 --> 03:46:37,695
MATT: You take a few minutes to look around, which
gives you two notifications. One, nothing seems to

3208
03:46:37,695 --> 03:46:42,942
be immediately coming in to search as to what the
noises were, and you do hear other distant sounds.

3209
03:46:42,942 --> 03:46:47,525
Impacts and cackling and stuff. You get the sense
that the tunnels deeper in have some activity

3210
03:46:47,525 --> 03:46:56,153
amongst the gnolls that live below whatever
they've converted this mine network to be. You

3211
03:46:56,153 --> 03:47:03,127
also see that all the bodies in this chamber have
been pretty much picked of any identifiable facets.

3212
03:47:03,127 --> 03:47:08,333
MARISHA: Jewelry, wedding bands, anything?

3213
03:47:08,333 --> 03:47:11,538
MATT: If you want to take some time to really pick
through it, you could try. Do you want to?

3214
03:47:11,538 --> 03:47:15,707
LIAM: No, we're still trying to get to people
here. Our options are we press forward to

3215
03:47:15,707 --> 03:47:21,871
something worse, or we backtrack and try the other
direction, or we get out of here.

3216
03:47:21,871 --> 03:47:25,120
TRAVIS: We have the silver thread up top, right?

3217
03:47:25,120 --> 03:47:26,696
SAM: Did we do that?

3218
03:47:26,696 --> 03:47:29,441
LIAM: Did we? No, we opted not to do that for
time's sake.

3219
03:47:29,441 --> 03:47:31,758
LAURA: We could do it now. As we move forward.

3220
03:47:31,758 --> 03:47:34,284
TRAVIS: Oh, it took a few minutes, didn't it?

3221
03:47:34,284 --> 03:47:36,121
LIAM: Yeah, we could do that now.

3222
03:47:36,121 --> 03:47:38,679
TALIESIN: How are you feeling, Fjord?

3223
03:47:38,679 --> 03:47:43,677
SAM: Yeah, Fjord, are we going to be Fjord
Explorers or Fjord Escapes?

3224
03:47:43,677 --> 03:47:46,387
LAURA: Jesus.

3225
03:47:46,387 --> 03:47:51,356
LIAM: Yeah. I could do that quickly. I could put
an Alarm here quickly. I could do it the fast way,

3226
03:47:51,356 --> 03:47:57,876
and know if anything is coming behind us. Is that
what we want to do? Do we want to go around? I

3227
03:47:57,876 --> 03:48:01,607
don't know, I'm a little terrified of what is down
there.

3228
03:48:01,607 --> 03:48:04,822
MARISHA: While he does that, can we, no we can't
take a short rest. It's not enough time.

3229
03:48:04,822 --> 03:48:06,022
MATT: That's up to you.

3230
03:48:06,022 --> 03:48:09,524
LIAM: That's a half hour is a short rest. Or an
hour is a short rest.

3231
03:48:09,524 --> 03:48:10,563
MATT: It's about an hour or so.

3232
03:48:10,563 --> 03:48:11,607
MARISHA: Nope. Ignore what I said.

3233
03:48:11,607 --> 03:48:15,082
LIAM: There's two ways that I can do this. I can
do it lickety-split or I can take my book out and

3234
03:48:15,082 --> 03:48:19,542
do it the harder way, but that's ten minutes,
about.

3235
03:48:19,542 --> 03:48:23,878
TRAVIS: I think it's in front of us.

3236
03:48:23,878 --> 03:48:29,750
MARISHA: There's something real big back there.
It's real big.

3237
03:48:29,750 --> 03:48:31,771
LIAM: We just have to march into it. Okay.

3238
03:48:31,771 --> 03:48:35,321
TALIESIN: I'm not convinced that they don't still
have people alive down there.

3239
03:48:35,321 --> 03:48:45,699
LAURA: I'm pretty much out of spells now. But
that's okay.

3240
03:48:45,699 --> 03:48:47,987
TRAVIS: A short rest doesn't get us spells back,
does it?

3241
03:48:47,987 --> 03:48:52,327
MATT: Not for her it doesn't. (singing)
Conservation!

3242
03:48:52,327 --> 03:48:56,783
LIAM: How are you with that sledgehammer on your
back?

3243
03:48:56,783 --> 03:48:58,237
LAURA: What do you mean?

3244
03:48:58,237 --> 03:48:59,958
LIAM: You're carrying a sledgehammer on your
back.

3245
03:48:59,958 --> 03:49:01,015
LAURA: Yeah.

3246
03:49:01,015 --> 03:49:02,262
LIAM: How are you with it?

3247
03:49:02,262 --> 03:49:05,770
LAURA: Oh. I don't know. It's a big weapon.

3248
03:49:05,770 --> 03:49:07,290
MARISHA: She's got a badass scythe.

3249
03:49:07,290 --> 03:49:09,949
MATT: It's more of a tool sledgehammer than a
weapon sledgehammer.

3250
03:49:09,949 --> 03:49:12,306
LAURA: Yeah, I've got a scythe. A sickle.

3251
03:49:12,306 --> 03:49:17,627
TRAVIS: I'd like to volunteer that perhaps we move
forward until we can see whether there are any

3252
03:49:17,627 --> 03:49:21,467
living people that we can help and we make a
decision then.

3253
03:49:21,467 --> 03:49:27,038
MARISHA: I saw nothing that would clue me in as to
what might be deeper and really big?

3254
03:49:27,038 --> 03:49:29,284
MATT: Nothing that caught your attention.

3255
03:49:29,284 --> 03:49:30,609
MARISHA: Okay. Let's go.

3256
03:49:30,609 --> 03:49:34,797
TRAVIS: That went far better than the village, but
also that big armored bastard wasn't there.

3257
03:49:34,797 --> 03:49:42,028
TALIESIN: Let's make a pile of these bodies, too.
Just in case, maybe they think that they took each

3258
03:49:42,028 --> 03:49:43,848
other apart.

3259
03:49:43,848 --> 03:49:46,655
LAURA: Let's set them up like they all were making
out.

3260
03:49:46,655 --> 03:49:50,752
LIAM: No, we don't have time for that here. We
have to get going.

3261
03:49:50,752 --> 03:49:54,086
SAM: Like some sort of a circle-jerky sort of a
thing?

3262
03:49:54,086 --> 03:49:55,487
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

3263
03:49:55,487 --> 03:49:56,619
TALIESIN: On the way out.

3264
03:49:56,619 --> 03:49:58,755
LAURA: Loosely prop them up like that.

3265
03:49:58,755 --> 03:50:03,177
LIAM: When we're victorious we can do disgusting
things as we leave. Nott, I think you should take

3266
03:50:03,177 --> 03:50:04,444
point again.

3267
03:50:04,444 --> 03:50:06,125
SAM: All right.

3268
03:50:06,125 --> 03:50:07,393
LAURA: Did you do the--

3269
03:50:07,393 --> 03:50:12,743
LIAM: That I thought that was for going back the
other way. We want to know if something comes

3270
03:50:12,743 --> 03:50:13,675
behind us?

3271
03:50:13,675 --> 03:50:14,844
LAURA: Yeah.

3272
03:50:14,844 --> 03:50:21,373
LIAM: The reasons for doing that are slighter and
I don't want to blow my wad magically.

3273
03:50:21,373 --> 03:50:22,655
LAURA: Okay.

3274
03:50:22,655 --> 03:50:24,395
LIAM: If we were going the other way, I might.

3275
03:50:24,395 --> 03:50:27,381
TALIESIN: I agree.

3276
03:50:27,381 --> 03:50:31,590
LAURA: Let's go and be really smart and do this.

3277
03:50:31,590 --> 03:50:33,515
SAM: Am I drunk or am I not drunk?

3278
03:50:33,515 --> 03:50:37,525
MATT: If you were to take about ten more minutes,
you'd stop being drunk.

3279
03:50:37,525 --> 03:50:39,882
LIAM: We talked for seven minutes, yeah?

3280
03:50:39,882 --> 03:50:40,997
TALIESIN: All right.

3281
03:50:40,997 --> 03:50:45,222
SAM: All right. Wait for three more minutes and
then go.

3282
03:50:45,222 --> 03:50:49,243
MATT: Okay, so you want to wait until Nott shakes
off the--

3283
03:50:49,243 --> 03:50:50,727
TRAVIS: The booze?

3284
03:50:50,727 --> 03:50:54,626
MATT: The influence, the booze. Eventually, you
regain--

3285
03:50:54,626 --> 03:50:58,822
MARISHA: While we wait for those three minutes I
turn to Molly and I say, Do you remember anything

3286
03:50:58,822 --> 03:51:05,967
in your recollections of this Yee...ah...noghu.

3287
03:51:05,967 --> 03:51:07,811
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeenoghu.

3288
03:51:07,811 --> 03:51:08,700
TALIESIN: Yoplait.

3289
03:51:08,700 --> 03:51:17,490
MARISHA: Uh-huh. Yoplait is a female deity? Or a
male deity? Do you remember?

3290
03:51:17,490 --> 03:51:24,266
TALIESIN: It's hard to remember. It's a lot of
aggression, anger.

3291
03:51:24,266 --> 03:51:27,601
MARISHA: I'm wondering with that whole, you
know--

3292
03:51:27,601 --> 03:51:29,467
LIAM: Why are you curious about that?

3293
03:51:29,467 --> 03:51:35,780
MARISHA: Well, the guy. The guy running the
ceremony said that the hunger will be fed, "ours

3294
03:51:35,780 --> 03:51:40,522
"and hers," right? I mean, that's what he said,
right, DM? I didn't mishear that?

3295
03:51:40,522 --> 03:51:41,861
MATT: Yes.

3296
03:51:41,861 --> 03:51:48,098
TALIESIN: Do I remember anything about either
gender or that this would be-- Other than

3297
03:51:48,098 --> 03:51:50,892
I just saw a lot of aggression and a feral aspect of this.

3298
03:51:50,892 --> 03:51:52,756
MATT: That was it, yeah.

3299
03:51:52,756 --> 03:51:56,429
MARISHA: I just wonder who "hers" is. Who is
that?

3300
03:51:56,429 --> 03:52:00,525
LIAM: That is the crux of the matter.

3301
03:52:00,525 --> 03:52:03,729
MARISHA: Yeah.

3302
03:52:03,729 --> 03:52:04,997
TALIESIN: Shall we go find out?

3303
03:52:04,997 --> 03:52:05,781
TRAVIS: Yep.

3304
03:52:05,781 --> 03:52:13,550
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,
you hear one sound that varies very strongly from

3305
03:52:13,550 --> 03:52:21,202
the others that have encompassed this tunnel
sequence. You hear this female scream, this

3306
03:52:21,202 --> 03:52:28,054
high-pitched shrieking scream that says, "No! My
baby!"

3307
03:52:28,054 --> 03:52:33,206
LAURA: Oh, no! This is what happens when we sit
down and we talk.

3308
03:52:33,206 --> 03:52:39,470
TRAVIS: We got to go. Can't fuck around with mama
deaths.

3309
03:52:39,470 --> 03:52:41,515
LAURA: We're moving forward as quickly as
possible.

3310
03:52:41,515 --> 03:52:42,786
SAM: I charge ahead.

3311
03:52:42,786 --> 03:52:47,528
MATT: You guys rush down the tunnel deeper into
the maze of mineshafts--

3312
03:52:47,528 --> 03:52:49,001
MARISHA: What?

3313
03:52:49,001 --> 03:52:50,340
MATT: And we'll pick up on that next week.

3314
03:52:50,340 --> 03:52:51,662
MARISHA: No!

3315
03:52:51,662 --> 03:52:56,723
SAM: Whose baby? Where are they? Why were they
crying? We'll find out next week.

3316
03:52:56,723 --> 03:53:03,962
LAURA: That's one way to get your players to move.
There's babies dying.

3317
03:53:03,962 --> 03:53:05,549
MATT: Also, babies.

3318
03:53:05,549 --> 03:53:07,421
MARISHA: Oh my God!

3319
03:53:07,421 --> 03:53:12,093
TRAVIS: (singing) We fucked up the gnolls, fucked
up the gnolls.

3320
03:53:12,093 --> 03:53:15,703
LAURA: I like that our pickle jar is getting
filled with little--

3321
03:53:15,703 --> 03:53:17,071
TALIESIN: Filled with pickled ears!

3322
03:53:17,071 --> 03:53:18,786
LAURA: I'm smushing them down so that there's
like--

3323
03:53:18,786 --> 03:53:21,798
MATT: Oh god! So it's actually briney pickled
gnoll ears?

3324
03:53:21,798 --> 03:53:24,608
TALIESIN: Have you ever had pickled pigs' feet?

3325
03:53:24,608 --> 03:53:27,113
LAURA: Well, we drank all the pickle juice out of
it, so, really they just kind of have a pickle stink.

3326
03:53:27,113 --> 03:53:28,033
MATT: That's true.

3327
03:53:28,033 --> 03:53:29,493
TALIESIN: They're in their own juices.

3328
03:53:29,493 --> 03:53:30,327
MATT: Yeah, there you go.

3329
03:53:30,327 --> 03:53:31,533
LIAM: It's like a tip jar.

3330
03:53:31,533 --> 03:53:37,511
MATT: Yeah, it'll be an interesting, interesting
learning process of conservation of spells as you

3331
03:53:37,511 --> 03:53:38,875
progress down--

3332
03:53:38,875 --> 03:53:41,480
LAURA: Well, I was saving them but then
fucking Fjord asked for healing.

3333
03:53:41,480 --> 03:53:46,182
MATT: I know. That's okay. That's what cantrips
are for. That's what weapons are for.

3334
03:53:46,182 --> 03:53:47,778
LAURA: That's what I was using, cantrips.

3335
03:53:47,778 --> 03:53:52,017
MATT: That's what I'm saying, something to keep--
as you continue forward if you need to assault

3336
03:53:52,017 --> 03:53:57,020
things. All right. Oh, quick announcement which is
fun, so we're going to have a guest next week.

3337
03:53:57,020 --> 03:53:58,260
SAM: Oh. We are?

3338
03:53:58,260 --> 03:53:59,681
MATT: Our first guest of the campaign.

3339
03:53:59,681 --> 03:54:02,791
MARISHA: We didn't know about this.

3340
03:54:02,791 --> 03:54:04,863
MATT: Yeah you did, I mentioned it.

3341
03:54:04,863 --> 03:54:07,140
MARISHA: We knew this. We totally fucking knew
this.

3342
03:54:07,140 --> 03:54:08,359
SAM: Do we know who it is?

3343
03:54:08,359 --> 03:54:13,887
MATT: Yeah, next week we'll be able to have on our
show Khary Payton.

3344
03:54:13,887 --> 03:54:16,235
LAURA: Yay!

3345
03:54:16,235 --> 03:54:20,511
MATT: He's a long-time friend of a lot of us here,
we've worked a lot in the VO community. If you

3346
03:54:20,511 --> 03:54:22,954
aren't familiar with him, you should look him up.
If you've been watching The Walking Dead or Fear

3347
03:54:22,954 --> 03:54:25,945
of the Walking Dead, he's been awesome. On that
show for a long time.

3348
03:54:25,945 --> 03:54:30,128
LIAM: Teen Titan's Go!, plays Grimlock on
Transformers, all over the place.

3349
03:54:30,128 --> 03:54:35,661
MATT: Phenomenal voice actor, great actor. We've
been talking for a long time, he's been wanting to

3350
03:54:35,661 --> 03:54:38,988
play in this for a long time, but he's been very
busy, of course, those things, but he's in town

3351
03:54:38,988 --> 03:54:40,426
and he'll be joining us.

3352
03:54:40,426 --> 03:54:41,289
MARISHA: He's so nice.

3353
03:54:41,289 --> 03:54:42,018
MATT: I know.

3354
03:54:42,018 --> 03:54:43,412
MARISHA: He's such a teddy bear.

3355
03:54:43,412 --> 03:54:46,772
MATT: He's fucking awesome. So we'll have Khary
here next week. We're so excited to have him join

3356
03:54:46,772 --> 03:54:55,008
us, and go give him a little love. He's actually
at a Kansas City convention right now with Will Friedle.

3357
03:54:55,008 --> 03:54:56,046
TRAVIS: Oh, nice!

3358
03:54:56,046 --> 03:54:58,921
MATT: So if you're in that area over the next few
days, you should go say hi and give him some

3359
03:54:58,921 --> 03:55:04,523
Critter love or on the internet as well. So, yeah,
excited to have him next week. In the interim,

3360
03:55:04,523 --> 03:55:13,852
guys, have a wonderful week, we love you, thank
you for joining us, and is it Thursday yet? Good night.
