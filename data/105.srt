00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,243
MATT: Hello everyone,

2
00:00:01,243 --> 00:00:02,970
and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role,

3
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,360
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

4
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,220
sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons.

5
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,000
ALL: (high-pitched and silly voices)
We play Dungeons & Dragons!

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,472
MATT: The evolution is something.

7
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:15,313
Thank you for joining us.

8
00:00:15,313 --> 00:00:16,620
Before we jump into tonight's episode,

9
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,660
we have some announcements to get through,

10
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,140
beginning with the first of our two sponsors,

11
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,330
which is tonight NordVPN, which means,

12
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:24,170
it says here on the sheet,

13
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,520
"We have another technoriffic installment

14
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,710
"of 'Nord by Nordwest:

15
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,229
"'The Quest for the Ultra Codex Reloaded.'"

16
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:33,300
(laughter)

17
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,220
Which, apparently, is the title

18
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:38,080
that Sam has now named these segments, so we'll just...

19
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:38,940
You know what?

20
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,210
Taliesin. Take it away, man.

21
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,270
TALIESIN: Thank you, Matt.

22
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,503
(laughter)

23
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:46,220
LIAM: Look at Marisha.

24
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,860
TALIESIN: As everyone on the dark net remembers,

25
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,210
blackwillow69@aol.com and KryptonicOverride

26
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,640
needed a level 12 master hacker

27
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,190
to get them out of the internet.

28
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,470
And it turns out you're looking at one.

29
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,580
I, FreezerBurn, spent 10 long years in nano-jail

30
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,315
for electro-crimes against webmanity.

31
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,714
But now I'm hacking for friendship.

32
00:01:07,714 --> 00:01:08,697
(laughter)

33
00:01:08,697 --> 00:01:12,180
You see, I'm an old-school hacker, really old school.

34
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,180
My power glove is cranked up to Duck Hunt,

35
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,970
but my secret weapon

36
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,720
is my mega abacus millennium edition,

37
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,624
given to me by none other than Pharaoh Ramses III.

38
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,968
(beads rattle)
Let's get jiggy with it.

39
00:01:24,968 --> 00:01:26,850
(laughter)
(beads rattling rapidly)

40
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,040
One, two, three...

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,140
Damn it!

42
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:30,982
Looks like they're behind

43
00:01:30,982 --> 00:01:34,550
a plex-folded, Fortran flamewall!

44
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,495
Ha! Child's Play, part two.

45
00:01:37,495 --> 00:01:40,160
Flip the floppy, unmax the headroom,

46
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,680
shoot the C++, and Baloo the TaleSpin!

47
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,463
Ugh, no.

48
00:01:46,463 --> 00:01:49,450
Not even my cyber abacus can unjack them.

49
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,358
This is a two-man job.

50
00:01:51,358 --> 00:01:55,950
ASHLEY: (cockney accent) Oi, did you say two-man job?

51
00:01:57,189 --> 00:02:00,126
You-- (laughs)
(laughter)

52
00:02:00,126 --> 00:02:02,501
You may've heard of me as the MadHatterson.

53
00:02:02,501 --> 00:02:04,980
Sure, me hacks on TV were mad fictional,

54
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,740
but I wrote every script!

55
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,830
Let's fuckin' rescue Laura!

56
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,821
TALIESIN: And Sam!
ASHLEY: What?

57
00:02:10,821 --> 00:02:13,384
Oi, yeah, of course, Sam too.

58
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:15,188
Come on, let's use everything we got!

59
00:02:15,188 --> 00:02:16,670
(beads rattling)
(laughter)

60
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,410
TALIESIN: I'm dropping code I learned in the Dark Ages!

61
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:22,620
ASHLEY: This binary sequence has plateaued on me COSTART!

62
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,520
TALIESIN: Gilgamesh itself invented the DDoS attack!

63
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,220
ASHLEY: The cube shall be...

64
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,936
ASHLEY and TALIESIN: Gleamed!

65
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:34,330
LAURA and SAM: (gasping)
SAM: Did it work?

66
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,910
LAURA: We're back!
ASHLEY: Yes!

67
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,177
Everything is A-OK!

68
00:02:39,177 --> 00:02:40,330
SAM: No!

69
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,260
Everything's changed.

70
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,010
There's a secret you all need to know,

71
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,420
and I'll tell you,

72
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,470
next time NordVPN sponsors our show.

73
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,330
They are the highest-quality encryption

74
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,450
for your internet traffic

75
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,270
and to hide your IP and physical location,

76
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,230
and it's the last chance to get their three-year deal

77
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,630
for $3.49 a month.

78
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:02,790
Go to NordVPN.com/CriticalRole and use code "CRITICALROLE"

79
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,400
to get 70% off a three-year plan

80
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,950
and a extra month for free.

81
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,710
Get going with secure, super-fast

82
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,110
NordLynx-powered VPN service now,

83
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,500
and I'll tell you all

84
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,010
what happened in the internet next time.

85
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,333
Matt, hack to you.

86
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,970
SAM: Matt, hack to you.

87
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,290
TRAVIS: Oh my god.
MATT: (clearing throat)

88
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,850
Thank you, Sam and everybody. Wow.

89
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:23,910
And especially Marisha,

90
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,880
who was really the key player in that narrative there.

91
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,573
MARISHA: I don't know why I had to be here.

92
00:03:28,573 --> 00:03:30,048
(laughter)

93
00:03:30,048 --> 00:03:31,731
SAM: You could've literally shown up to work

94
00:03:31,731 --> 00:03:32,939
15 minutes late.
LAURA: There's so much color

95
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:34,172
on that screen right now

96
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,790
between your hair and Ashley's jacket.

97
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,780
LIAM: I encourage everybody to watch
that segment a second time

98
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,916
to watch Marisha's subtle facial journey

99
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,915
through it all.

100
00:03:43,915 --> 00:03:46,553
SAM: Oh, Ashley, that was amazing.
TALIESIN: That was fantastic.

101
00:03:46,553 --> 00:03:48,530
ASHLEY: I know, my accent, I really--

102
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,204
TRAVIS: You took us to another world.

103
00:03:50,204 --> 00:03:51,060
ASHLEY: -- for a long time.

104
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,820
TRAVIS: We got New York in there somehow at one point.

105
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,653
ASHLEY: Yes.
LIAM: Fusion.

106
00:03:54,653 --> 00:03:56,030
ASHLEY: I wanted to cover a lot of--

107
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,640
I come from everywhere.

108
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,271
TRAVIS: Crikey! Australia.
TALIESIN: Hack the planet.

109
00:04:00,271 --> 00:04:02,358
ASHLEY: Hack the planet. Hack the--

110
00:04:02,358 --> 00:04:03,260
MATT: And well done.

111
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,990
Thank you, Ashley, thank you, Sam.

112
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,142
Thank you, NordVPN.

113
00:04:07,142 --> 00:04:08,630
Our second sponsor tonight is our good friend

114
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,070
since the beginning of Campaign Two,

115
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,587
D&D Beyond.
TRAVIS: ♪ D&D Beyond! ♪

116
00:04:12,587 --> 00:04:13,800
MATT: So for those who aren't aware,

117
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,990
D&D Beyond has now added a digital dice-rolling feature

118
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,560
to their fantastic online elements there.

119
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,220
It's integrated into the character sheet now,

120
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,310
so if there's any rollable stat in the game,

121
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,460
you can go ahead and just click on it,

122
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,060
and it will roll it for you,

123
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,320
add the modifiers and give you the roll that you need,

124
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,770
which is awesome and super-convenient,

125
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,390
especially if you're having to play games online

126
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,900
like everyone is, and having to roll dice,

127
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,880
and that whole thing can be weird,

128
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,830
and losing it and drop it and let the space...

129
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,710
Maybe it's just me in my office.

130
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,920
But you can start your collection now of digital dice

131
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,690
with the new Archmage's Favor dice,

132
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,210
a digital set with unique animations

133
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,320
and sounds that pulse with unstable magic

134
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,550
and unleashes ancient arcane magic across your screen

135
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,320
with every natural 20.

136
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,600
That sounds cool.

137
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,690
Probably not dangerous at all.

138
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,523
But check it out today at

139
00:04:57,523 --> 00:05:02,106
dndbeyond.link/CRArch,

140
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:03,772
A-R-C-H.

141
00:05:03,772 --> 00:05:04,730
And thank you again, once again,

142
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:08,210
for D&D Beyond for sponsoring our show all this time.

143
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,420
For our announcements,

144
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,702
Laura, you've got some things to mention.

145
00:05:11,702 --> 00:05:15,292
LAURA: I've got a couple of things to talk about.

146
00:05:15,292 --> 00:05:18,822
Um...
(triumphant fanfare)

147
00:05:18,822 --> 00:05:19,810
(clamoring)

148
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,860
Take it off this super-cool hanger, hold on.

149
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,377
(triumphant fanfare)
(laughter)

150
00:05:26,377 --> 00:05:29,668
It's our very first CR polo shirt!

151
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:31,480
TRAVIS: Give it to me!

152
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,720
LAURA: For all those professional nerds out there

153
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,190
that need to have a collar.
TRAVIS: Give it.

154
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,400
LAURA: Look at this!
SAM: Is there a lining in there?

155
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,250
LAURA: There's a cool--

156
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,110
It's, like, a upper lining thing.

157
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,710
Just, you know, a little something something

158
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:50,140
that we added for fun.
(laughter)

159
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,340
MATT: A little secret just for you.

160
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,400
LAURA: A little secret just for your little polo. Hold on.

161
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,090
Oh! A little contrast lining!

162
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,049
SAM: Ooh!
LAURA: So yeah.

163
00:05:58,049 --> 00:05:59,320
This is in the store.

164
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,370
This is in the store right now

165
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:05,326
in the US and the UK CritRole shops, da-da.

166
00:06:05,326 --> 00:06:06,962
(laughter)

167
00:06:06,962 --> 00:06:09,700
Okay, and then the second thing...

168
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,695
(laughter)

169
00:06:13,695 --> 00:06:14,720
LAURA: Then

170
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,553
the other thing

171
00:06:15,553 --> 00:06:18,433
that I wanted to talk about is this box.

172
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,880
TRAVIS: Put out the flames.
LAURA: Inside of it--

173
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,630
TRAVIS: It's burning--
LAURA: (gasping)

174
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,145
SAM: Ooh, whoa.

175
00:06:25,145 --> 00:06:26,413
LAURA: Oh!

176
00:06:26,413 --> 00:06:30,990
It's our Don't Forget to Love Each Other mug!

177
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,230
MARISHA: So cute!

178
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,675
LAURA: Right?

179
00:06:33,675 --> 00:06:35,480
So yeah, these are so wonderful,

180
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,410
and these are now available in the US, UK,

181
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,750
and the Australia Critical Role shops.

182
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,160
It's got the same 11 flags

183
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,480
as our updated t-shirt that we recently released,

184
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,760
and six dollars of every mug sold will be donated

185
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,740
to OutRight Action International.

186
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,770
MARISHA: Yeah!
TRAVIS: That's wonderful.

187
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,420
MARISHA: It's so cute.
TRAVIS: It's a good mug.

188
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,820
It's a fair amount of coffee.

189
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,170
LAURA: You know how I am about mugs,

190
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:01,123
so I wanted to make sure this mug was awesome.

191
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,600
MATT: Hell yeah. Thank you, Laura.
LAURA: You're welcome.

192
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,460
SAM: Good job, Laura.
TRAVIS: Oh, man.

193
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,980
MATT: And so I think with that, our announcements conclude,

194
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,317
which means it's time for us to go ahead and jump into

195
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:15,933
tonight's episode of--

196
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:17,308
TRAVIS: Too early.
MARISHA: We don't have a plan!

197
00:07:17,308 --> 00:07:18,316
MATT: -- Critical Role.

(laughter

238
00:08:59,092 --> 00:09:01,310
MATT: And welcome back.
TALIESIN: That works.

239
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,589
LIAM: Delayed reaction on that.
MATT: So.

240
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:05,849
Last we left off:

241
00:09:05,849 --> 00:09:08,922
The Mighty Nein, after arriving to the island of Rumblecusp

242
00:09:08,922 --> 00:09:12,012
to set up the coming Traveler Con, now naught

243
00:09:12,012 --> 00:09:14,791
but probably seven days away.

244
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:17,007
You discovered that a culture of people

245
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:18,389
had been living here for quite some time

246
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:19,812
before you arrived,

247
00:09:19,812 --> 00:09:23,554
worshiping this fire entity known as Vokodo,

248
00:09:23,554 --> 00:09:25,322
and an enchantment seemed to lay on the space

249
00:09:25,322 --> 00:09:27,073
that caused them to forget

250
00:09:27,073 --> 00:09:28,580
everything about their past lives

251
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,356
and live here happily amongst their new society here

252
00:09:31,356 --> 00:09:32,863
in the village of Vo.

253
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,655
With the aid of one such druid

254
00:09:34,655 --> 00:09:36,679
as their spiritual guardian, named Viridian,

255
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:38,262
you went and spoke with this fire god

256
00:09:38,262 --> 00:09:39,672
who seems a little less godlike

257
00:09:39,672 --> 00:09:43,802
and a little more like strange, greedy entity

258
00:09:43,802 --> 00:09:46,639
that rules those on the island.

259
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:49,947
You freed the mind, long clouded, of this druid

260
00:09:49,947 --> 00:09:52,255
and discovered her name is actually Vilya,

261
00:09:52,255 --> 00:09:54,215
apparently a druid from Tal'Dorei,

262
00:09:54,215 --> 00:09:55,788
and you began to figure out

263
00:09:55,788 --> 00:09:58,604
how best to possibly free the island

264
00:09:58,604 --> 00:10:00,704
of whatever this creature's influence is

265
00:10:00,704 --> 00:10:04,418
in preparation for the coming hordes of Traveler followers

266
00:10:04,418 --> 00:10:07,063
that are making their way.

267
00:10:07,063 --> 00:10:11,080
You then traveled across to the Heaven Falls,

268
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,380
an upward shooting waterfall

269
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,910
on the eastern side of the island,

270
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:18,090
which seemed to contain behind it an illusory cliff-face,

271
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,730
a bunch of ships that had been long hoarded away,

272
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,540
apparently the vessels that carried

273
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,720
many of the people that live on the island here originally

274
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,300
and then were kept from sight

275
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,300
to prevent them from remembering where they came from

276
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,440
and how to leave.

277
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,620
You nearly lost Caduceus, who was drawn in

278
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,400
by some sort of magical enchantment

279
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,810
at the tunnels that lead to Vokodo's lair, and upon fleeing,

280
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,060
you made your way northward to the strange Ruins,

281
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,990
a sliver, one of many, of strange segments

282
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,180
of either this world or other nearby dimensions

283
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,780
that came here, it seems,

284
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:53,778
when Vokodo fled here from the Astral Sea for some reason.

285
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,460
Unfortunately, you destroyed the spirits

286
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,560
that remained at the Ruin,

287
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,430
as opposed to seeking possible an alliance with them,

288
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,300
but in doing so,

289
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,770
also removed a dangerous aspect of the island

290
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,170
that prevented people from going there,

291
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,150
so not all is lost.
(laughter)

292
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:15,650
Gathering yourselves and beginning your trek backward

293
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:20,650
past towards the actual volcano of Rumblecusp

294
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,620
later in the afternoon,

295
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,495
you begin to plot

296
00:11:25,495 --> 00:11:29,210
whatever your next stage of engagement

297
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,470
with the dangers of this island may be.

298
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:35,600
So as you return, you guys have begun making your trek back

299
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,080
from the northern side of the island from the Ruin,

300
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,140
at which case Vilya does mention,

301
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,807
as it begins to grow a little more dangerous.

302
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,093
"It's interesting.

303
00:11:48,093 --> 00:11:50,720
"Since you've cleared my mind,

304
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,300
"I'm still kind of finding myself,

305
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,530
"but I feel I might be able

306
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:59,950
"to get us somewhere on the island rather quickly,

307
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,267
"if I've been there."

308
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,310
TRAVIS: How do you mean?

309
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,760
MATT: "Uh, getting to the Ruins,

310
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,400
"or places that I have not actually been

311
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,010
"or seen myself before,

312
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,600
"I have to travel the challenging way,

313
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,650
"but if I know of a tree that I've seen

314
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,650
"or been around previously--"
LAURA: (gasping)

315
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:20,120
MATT: "I may be able to bring us there,

316
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,370
"if we have a tree to enter."
SAM: If we have a tree?

317
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,330
Your village is lousy with trees.

318
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,240
You've got nothing but trees.
MATT: "Right.

319
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,490
"Would you like to go back to the village?

320
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:30,650
"Did you want to make your way to the Heaven Falls again?

321
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,970
"Did you want to make your way to Vokodo's lair?"

322
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,312
LAURA: If we can get to the village quickly,

323
00:12:33,312 --> 00:12:37,490
then we could maybe try to free the mind of somebody else

324
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,540
and they could help us.

325
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,600
TRAVIS: Terra, the hunting leader?
LAURA: Yeah.

326
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,610
TALIESIN: Kind of tapped out at this point.

327
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,380
LAURA: Oh. Am I, too?

328
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,760
Maybe.
ASHLEY: What time is it?

329
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,110
SAM: Afternoon?
MATT: It's afternoon,

330
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,480
after you guys have traveled out to the--

331
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,990
LAURA: I've got a 6th-level left.

332
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:54,500
TRAVIS: Just to be clear, it's like a teleportation?

333
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,110
We just step in a circle like our friend can do, or--?

334
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,980
MATT: "It's a little different."

335
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,324
TRAVIS: Oh. A tree.
LIAM: How does the tree factor into it?

336
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,420
Is it like a component

337
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,520
for what you would do, or--?

338
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,454
MATT: "The tree becomes the door."

339
00:13:10,454 --> 00:13:13,180
TALIESIN: Huh.
TRAVIS: The tree becomes the door.

340
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,600
MATT: "I understand that you may ascribe to

341
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,570
"the more esoteric arcane spell constructs.

342
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,670
"I, myself, tend to lean on nature and the elements

343
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:27,910
"to draw the intent, so."

344
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,743
TALIESIN: Hm.

345
00:13:28,743 --> 00:13:30,549
MATT: "Just trust me."

346
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:31,930
LIAM: All right.

347
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,910
I would love to see a tree turn into a door.

348
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,010
LAURA: Me, too.
TALIESIN: I mean,

349
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,258
most doors used to be trees.

350
00:13:37,258 --> 00:13:40,380
LIAM: Yeah, but that's a slower process.

351
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,240
LAURA: Some doors are made of stone.

352
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,623
TALIESIN: That's true. That does happen.
LAURA: Some doors are made of iron.

353
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,011
TRAVIS: I forget.

354
00:13:46,011 --> 00:13:48,970
Are we trying to drive to Vokodo before we rest?

355
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,390
No. We're doing one more night, right?

356
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:54,190
LAURA: Yeah, we have to, because if we take a rest tonight,

357
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,340
then we can all have a nice fancy feast.

358
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,890
TRAVIS: We could try and wait in the village.

359
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,610
We could try to convince Terra,

360
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:04,233
but also, Terra may resist and

361
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:05,968
try to stop us.

362
00:14:05,968 --> 00:14:08,850
SAM: Or rouse the village against us.

363
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,275
TRAVIS: Right.
TALIESIN: Hmm.

364
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,690
SAM: Once we do, with or without Terra,

365
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,630
do we have a plan after that?

366
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:21,320
Were we going to go in from the front and the back

367
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,730
at the same time or something?

368
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,390
Was that a plan?

369
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,380
TALIESIN: We thought that there was no sneaking up.

370
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:31,350
I think the idea's to go in just as we were,

371
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,470
and see if the element of surprise

372
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,820
could just be our intentions.

373
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,850
LAURA: I mean, we can always try again tomorrow

374
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:41,283
to see if our divine...

375
00:14:41,283 --> 00:14:43,350
people can help us.

376
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,050
SAM: You're so religious.
LAURA: You know.

377
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:46,883
TRAVIS: Yeah, well, we're going to try

378
00:14:46,883 --> 00:14:48,190
and get him out of his--
TALIESIN: I'm tapped for that.

379
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,765
LAURA: Yeah, but tomorrow.

380
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:52,020
TALIESIN: One week.
LAURA: Oh, it worked!

381
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,710
TRAVIS: Should we try and draw him out from his hot springs

382
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,780
underneath the volcano?

383
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,760
LIAM: And what would be something that would tempt him

384
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,070
out of his cubby hole?

385
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,940
LAURA: I've been thinking about this, you guys.

386
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,040
TRAVIS: You were what?

387
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,940
LAURA: Well, what if...

388
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,528
You know how he has all those ships?

389
00:15:11,528 --> 00:15:12,453
SAM: Mm-hmm?

390
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,880
LAURA: Well, when I was talking to the dragon turtle,

391
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,130
he said he takes what he wants

392
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,440
and he likes to have all of his stuff.

393
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,920
He thinks he has the most stuff.

394
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:27,840
So what if I were to just send him a little message

395
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,910
and tell him that, you know,

396
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,480
maybe somebody else out there has more stuff,

397
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,360
and he's not as cool as he thought he was.

398
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,550
SAM: That's brilliant.
TRAVIS: (laughs)

399
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:43,020
SAM: That's brilliant.
TRAVIS: (clearing throat)

400
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,610
SAM: I remember, but for those who don't,

401
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:51,310
the access to the shipyard, the hidden shipyard,

402
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,455
is it accessible by the ocean?

403
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:55,288
It has to be, right?

404
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,603
How do the ships get there?
MATT: It is, yes.

405
00:15:56,603 --> 00:15:57,830
SAM: It is.
MARISHA: It is?

406
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,630
TRAVIS: It is, but the tunnel through,

407
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:02,000
in that particular tunnel, doesn't quite seem...

408
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,880
LAURA: Yeah, but he's a fucking dragon turtle.

409
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,230
I mean, I'm sure he could

410
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,113
bust a hole if he wanted to.

411
00:16:08,113 --> 00:16:10,610
Besides the fact, if he went into the area

412
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,740
that has all the ships and he was like,

413
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,380
"Fuck these ships, these should be my ships!"

414
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,000
And was like, "Fuck you!"

415
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,690
And then he destroys everything,

416
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,090
don't you think Vokodo would come out

417
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,300
and be like, "What the shit?!"

418
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,090
And he would try to attack the thing that was attacking him?

419
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,220
And then he would be out,

420
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,010
and then we could all attack him there too,

421
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,560
and then we would be fighting with the dragon turtle,

422
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,720
and then he would be like, "Oh my gosh, I love you guys,"

423
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,430
and he would give us a ride home.

424
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:35,470
SAM: This is a rock-solid plan.

425
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,020
I'm in, yes, correct.

426
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,740
TRAVIS: The evolution of that idea was staggering.

427
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,573
I like how it ended

428
00:16:40,573 --> 00:16:43,020
with us riding the dragon turtle into the sunset.

429
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,640
LIAM: Yeah, he would also have to
negotiate through a shipyard

430
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,910
in an underground cavern

431
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,910
and then go through tunnels,

432
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,630
which were not that large.

433
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,760
We had a hard time getting Caduceus out of them.

434
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,593
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's correct.

435
00:16:54,593 --> 00:16:56,010
LIAM: So that was a bit of a tight fit, and--

436
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,490
LAURA: Yeah, but I'm sure Vokodo

437
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,860
has a way to get out of his lair.

438
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,140
TRAVIS: Isn't it a maze under there?

439
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,440
Maybe there are more tunnels

440
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,110
we didn't see, larger ones.
LAURA: There's got to be something.

441
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,410
TRAVIS: Like, how did he get in there?

442
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,185
LAURA: Exactly! He has to have a way in and out.

443
00:17:06,185 --> 00:17:07,310
SAM: We don't need the dragon turtle

444
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,360
to get to Vokodo.

445
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,490
We just need the dragon turtle to get to the ship.

446
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,323
TRAVIS: What would it cost?

447
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:15,430
What would it cost for you to execute this batshit plan?

448
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,090
LAURA: A spell.

449
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,000
TRAVIS: A big one?

450
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,031
LAURA: No, it's just my Sending spell.
TRAVIS: Oh!

451
00:17:21,031 --> 00:17:23,551
LAURA: I have so many messages I can send him right now.
TRAVIS: We should totally do that.

452
00:17:23,551 --> 00:17:25,330
MARISHA: I mean, it's worth a shot.

453
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,580
If it doesn't work, then

454
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,150
we're no further away from our original plan.

455
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,410
LIAM: -- of walking in and--

456
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,890
TRAVIS: Yeah. We're not much
worse off if nothing happens.

457
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,370
MARISHA: And it goes with that

458
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,500
playing his weakness against each other.

459
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,300
He's super fucking greedy.

460
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,300
TRAVIS: How long--

461
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,178
Oh, we don't know where the dragon turtle is, do we?

462
00:17:42,178 --> 00:17:45,025
LAURA: Mm-mmm, but he did recently destroy our ship,

463
00:17:45,025 --> 00:17:46,853
within the last day or so, so he's close.

464
00:17:46,853 --> 00:17:49,280
SAM: Yeah, he's within a day or two's journey.

465
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,171
TRAVIS: Okay. Well, that's fucking--

466
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:54,660
MARISHA: I'm trying to think if there are any other holes

467
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,901
we're not thinking of.

468
00:17:55,901 --> 00:17:56,970
SAM: Oh, of course there are,

469
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,795
but you know.
MARISHA: Yeah.

470
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,810
Should we try and steal a ship

471
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:04,070
and squirrel one away for ourselves?

472
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:07,084
TRAVIS: It would be nice to keep one on the side.

473
00:18:07,084 --> 00:18:08,820
MARISHA: Before they fight and destroy them all.

474
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,911
LAURA: But it's not like we couldn't

475
00:18:09,911 --> 00:18:12,444
get off of the island, right, Vilya?

476
00:18:13,418 --> 00:18:17,500
MATT: "I mean, there are ways to leave the island, yes."

477
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,200
LAURA: Yeah, I mean, you have trees that you know of, right?

478
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,010
MATT: Yes.
TRAVIS: On the island.

479
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,280
LAURA: But you have trees that you remember

480
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,850
from before the island.

481
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,550
MATT: "I know many trees across Exandria

482
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,216
"from my travels."
LAURA: Yeah! So we could hop into any tree!

483
00:18:28,216 --> 00:18:29,830
TRAVIS: Oh, you can go to any tree you've ever known?

484
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,422
MATT: "That I've visited, yes."

485
00:18:31,422 --> 00:18:33,555
TRAVIS: Well, fuck! That's way different.

486
00:18:33,555 --> 00:18:34,780
MATT: "But you also mentioned

487
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,190
"that you're able to teleport as well, correct?"

488
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:42,210
LIAM: Ja, although I can only
bring through so many people.

489
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,833
It does not last very long. I'm not sure what--

490
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:48,250
I mean, there's all the people in Vo.

491
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,090
LAURA: Do you have a limited amount of people

492
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,180
that you can bring through a tree?

493
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:55,860
MATT: "It's a very short time that it exists."

494
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,918
TRAVIS: How short?

495
00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:58,668
MATT: "Six seconds."

496
00:18:58,668 --> 00:19:00,130
TRAVIS: Ooh.

497
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,730
SAM: But that's how long Caleb's spell lasts,

498
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,950
and we've managed.

499
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,980
LIAM: I'm probably more limited.

500
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,490
There's only a small handful of places

501
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:10,460
where I could bring people.
MATT: "True.

502
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:14,430
"Though I would say, just as a point of reference,

503
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,710
"for a lot of these people who live here in the village,

504
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:21,010
"if we were to free them of Vokodo's influence,

505
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,530
"there's a good chance that many of these ships

506
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,813
"are their livelihood.

507
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,700
"So even if we were to take them away from the island--

508
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,600
"and I can't say this,

509
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,280
"because I don't know what their histories are--

510
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,810
"that's a lot of money that we're destroying

511
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:39,135
"that these people may have worked for in their life,

512
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,200
"and it might be all that remains with them."

513
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,600
TRAVIS: Yes, but there's life and then there are things.

514
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,433
MATT: "That's true."

515
00:19:46,433 --> 00:19:47,430
MARISHA: If they've been gone for that long,

516
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,630
they're presumed dead.

517
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,534
SAM: Life doesn't need things to live.

518
00:19:51,534 --> 00:19:52,856
(laughter)

519
00:19:52,856 --> 00:19:54,648
TALIESIN: It can be perfectly content without it.

520
00:19:54,648 --> 00:19:56,539
(laughter)

521
00:19:56,539 --> 00:20:00,820
TRAVIS: I couldn't finish it.
(laughter)

522
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,020
LAURA: I mean, do you think there's a chance

523
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:06,420
that anybody that, you know, has been here this long,

524
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,745
they may just want to stay?

525
00:20:08,745 --> 00:20:09,980
MATT: "I don't know.

526
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,190
"It's possible."
LAURA: People have babies here!

527
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:16,030
MATT: "There's probably some who have only known their life

528
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:16,863
"on this island.

529
00:20:16,863 --> 00:20:19,010
"We have children who were born here."

530
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,210
LIAM: Oh.
MARISHA: Even still.

531
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,800
MATT: "It's complicated."
MARISHA: Releasing them from Vokodo

532
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,100
would at least give them their own free will

533
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,890
to decide what to do.
MATT: "Exactly."

534
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,690
LAURA: Plus, they don't know that those ships are okay.

535
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,740
For all they know, Vokodo destroyed them.

536
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,060
MATT: "The choice is yours.

537
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,180
"I'm following your lead."

538
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,013
TRAVIS: Sure, sure.

539
00:20:35,013 --> 00:20:35,950
There are plenty of trees.

540
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:39,464
I mean, how hard is it to chop down a tree and make a ship?

541
00:20:39,464 --> 00:20:40,997
Pretty hard.

542
00:20:40,997 --> 00:20:42,430
MARISHA: (laughs)

543
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:44,055
TALIESIN: I genuinely have no idea.

544
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,570
LAURA: Besides, you know, we don't even know

545
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:50,190
if this is going to work.

546
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,570
SAM: Yeah, your Sending relationship

547
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:57,090
with Mr. Turtle Man was iffy, if I recall, right?

548
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,100
LAURA: No, he really liked me a lot.

549
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,933
TRAVIS and SAM: Oh!

550
00:20:59,933 --> 00:21:02,050
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. We had really good conversations.

551
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,076
SAM: Oh.

552
00:21:03,076 --> 00:21:05,740
TRAVIS: How many times have you communicated?

553
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,840
LAURA: Pretty much, like,--

554
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,631
I just talked to him, like, 10 minutes ago,

555
00:21:09,631 --> 00:21:11,690
and he was like, "Oh, hey Jester, what's going on?"

556
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,115
LIAM: What is his name?

557
00:21:13,115 --> 00:21:14,588
LAURA: Dragon turtle.

558
00:21:14,588 --> 00:21:17,432
MARISHA: (laughs)
LIAM: Okay.

559
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:19,923
MARISHA: Yasha.

560
00:21:19,923 --> 00:21:20,780
LIAM: D Turtle.

561
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,870
MARISHA: You've been very quiet.

562
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:22,770
What do you think?

563
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,390
ASHLEY: I mean, we don't quite have a plan yet to fight him,

564
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,510
so we might as well try this.

565
00:21:31,933 --> 00:21:34,030
If we can get somebody else to fight him,

566
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,590
and I'm sure when he dies,

567
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,070
everybody will start to remember things.

568
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,330
TRAVIS: The dragon turtle or Vokodo?

569
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,780
ASHLEY: Vokodo.
TRAVIS: Oh, yes. Of course.

570
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,370
TALIESIN: Will we have to fight the dragon turtle?

571
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,460
MARISHA: That's actually a good point.

572
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,930
ASHLEY: We'd have to fight the dragon turtle.

573
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:50,440
MARISHA: Or we could have to fight both.

574
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,030
LAURA: The dragon turtle will probably be--

575
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:55,830
Whichever one made it out would be weakened.

576
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,172
Right?
TRAVIS: Weekend?

577
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,840
LAURA: In the weakened state?
TRAVIS: Oh.

578
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,110
LIAM: Well, what about this?

579
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,180
Building on your idea, Jester,

580
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:08,337
what if you send your message to your dragon turtle?

581
00:22:10,206 --> 00:22:12,750
What if we holed up into the shipyard

582
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,430
and kept ourselves hidden,

583
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:18,920
and we kick off a kaiju battle there,

584
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:23,911
and while Vokodo is occupied with your friend, D Turtle--

585
00:22:25,294 --> 00:22:26,980
LIAM: We attempt to--

586
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:31,970
You, and you, and I attempt to
send him away while he's busy,

587
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:32,850
rather than walking in

588
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,260
and having all of his attention and ire directed at us.

589
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,618
If it works. Maybe it won't.
LAURA: If it works.

590
00:22:37,618 --> 00:22:39,410
LIAM: But if it works,

591
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,880
we don't let your friend handle it all.

592
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,260
We lie in wait, hidden, and then from the peanut gallery,

593
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,770
we attempt to banish him away.

594
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:50,447
MARISHA: And you're talking about Guacamole?

595
00:22:50,447 --> 00:22:51,513
LAURA and TALIESIN: Yes.
LIAM: Ja.

596
00:22:51,513 --> 00:22:53,138
LAURA: And if it doesn't work

597
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:56,263
then we just go in all on our own

598
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:01,180
and try to fight a giant, almost godlike creature.

599
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,360
ASHLEY: Wait, but what do we do with the dragon turtle

600
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,447
once Guacamole maybe is gone?

601
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,293
LAURA: Wait, what?

602
00:23:10,293 --> 00:23:12,110
ASHLEY: What do we do with the dragon turtle then?

603
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,160
LAURA: Well, then, he'll have some ships

604
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,193
and he'll probably--

605
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:16,900
TRAVIS: Lots of treasure, as well,

606
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,220
on the back of Vokodo.
ASHLEY: He'll just stay in there.

607
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,910
TRAVIS: Well, or take it to his underwater lair.

608
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,550
I think they drag ships down,

609
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,630
and then take it to wherever--

610
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,690
MARISHA: You're sure he won't
still have a personal vendetta?

611
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:31,020
He's mainly just here for the ships,

612
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:35,480
and not the murder side of it, right?

613
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,100
SAM: We will have done him a great favor, though.

614
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,310
LAURA: I mean, he'll get so much treasure from it.

615
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,660
SAM: Also, I don't know anything,

616
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,350
but I'm going to confidently say

617
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:47,870
that he'll probably only take out one or two of the ships.

618
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:50,310
There's lots.
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

619
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,143
TALIESIN: I don't know.

620
00:23:51,143 --> 00:23:53,850
Transmutation tends to leave a sour taste.

621
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,070
People can really hold that grudge.

622
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:55,980
TRAVIS: Wait a minute.

623
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,410
Can one of you grow or shrink things?

624
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:00,430
LIAM: Yeah.

625
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,980
TRAVIS: Like, if the dragon turtle's a huge nuisance

626
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,170
and it comes into the cave,

627
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,560
can we (whooshing)

628
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,800
shrink him down and go through the tunnel and then (pop)?

629
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,560
LAURA: We polymorphed him before.

630
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,140
SAM: Why does he need to go down the tunnel?

631
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,670
To get him to Vokodo?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

632
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,150
SAM: Why does he need to go to Vokodo?

633
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,370
MARISHA: If Vokodo doesn't come out to fight him.

634
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,240
SAM: We're trying to get Vokodo to come to him, I thought.

635
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,690
TRAVIS: Oh, well, yeah.
LAURA: That's the goal.

636
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,330
But if he doesn't...

637
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,610
MARISHA: And that means we're hoping

638
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:24,380
he starts destroying a lot of ships,

639
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,890
because that would ideally lure out Vokodo.

640
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,270
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Do we know,

641
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:33,640
in our interactions with D Turtle,

642
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,110
did he connect with one of us?

643
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:40,560
Like, see one of our eyes and know hatred?

644
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,150
Does he have an enemy among us?

645
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:46,340
MARISHA: We threw Jester and Caduceus and Caleb overboard

646
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,810
and had them water-ski behind the ship.

647
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:49,880
LAURA: And we turned him into a little--

648
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,020
MARISHA: Turned him into a slug.
SAM: But do you think

649
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,780
he clocked one of you?

650
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,740
LAURA: Well, I've been talking to him, so, you know.

651
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,370
SAM: But you could be the, like,

652
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,203
"Hey, I'm on the ship.

653
00:24:58,203 --> 00:25:00,370
"Come destroy this one."
LAURA: Hey, who's over here!

654
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:02,253
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

655
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,550
You know, it depends on how we want to play it.

656
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:08,400
I can try to antagonize him to make him come here.

657
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,557
I can try to be nice to him to make him come here.

658
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,493
TRAVIS: I had another idea.

659
00:25:13,493 --> 00:25:14,910
I don't think it's as good.

660
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:17,820
If he was fleeing from the Astral Plane, right?

661
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:21,470
Which is where the astral dreadnought was from?

662
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:24,550
Is there a chance that maybe using Major Image

663
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,370
to conjure an astral dreadnought

664
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:28,130
outside the volcano and have it be like,

665
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:30,910
"Vokodo, I'm here to kill you!"

666
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,640
Would make him run?

667
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,180
SAM: Can you do that?
TRAVIS: Yeah!

668
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,480
SAM: How big can your image be?

669
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,670
TRAVIS: Any creature that's big as fuck, it says.

670
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,771
Those are the words.

671
00:25:40,771 --> 00:25:42,270
(laughter)

672
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,990
MATT: The official ruling.
TRAVIS: "Visible phenomenon

673
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,030
"that is no larger than a 20-foot cube," so...

674
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,010
SAM: 20-foot cube?
TRAVIS: Pretty big.

675
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:49,400
SAM: How big was the astral dreadnought?

676
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,460
LAURA: Was it 20 feet?

677
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,910
MATT: It was a little larger than that,

678
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:54,370
but you could make a slightly runtish--

679
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:55,830
MARISHA: Ooh, we could use forced perspective.

680
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:58,590
If you put him far enough on the horizon--

681
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,700
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah!
MARISHA: You know?

682
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,980
And use one of the ships

683
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,532
in the foreground.
TRAVIS: Astral dreadnought lite.

684
00:26:02,532 --> 00:26:04,850
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah!

685
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:05,850
TRAVIS: I don't know.

686
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,510
MARISHA: They did it on Lord of the Rings. It worked.

687
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,960
LAURA: Yeah, you could totally do that.

688
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,990
MARISHA: Yeah.
LIAM: Potentially.

689
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,720
But a creature who has little trouble

690
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,030
getting into the minds of so many people,

691
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,277
you'd have to question whether it would be easy to--

692
00:26:16,277 --> 00:26:18,710
TRAVIS: Good call. That's fair.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

693
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,320
MARISHA: I like the D Turtle idea.

694
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,320
ASHLEY: Yeah. I feel like it doesn't hurt to try.

695
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,950
TRAVIS: DT?
MARISHA: Yeah, DT.

696
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,630
LAURA: Should I send a message?
SAM: What could it hurt

697
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,700
to try to lure a vicious turtle--

698
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,040
ASHLEY: I think it's a fantastic idea.

699
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,320
SAM: Yeah, what could go wrong?
ASHLEY: Yeah. What could go wrong?

700
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,790
TRAVIS: He'll thank us for all of the free--

701
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:39,680
They're intelligent.

702
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,330
They strike deals with sailors sometimes.

703
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,500
If there is gold--
SAM: They do?

704
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,700
TRAVIS: Yeah!
SAM: How do you know this?

705
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,940
TRAVIS: It's all part of the lore!

706
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,092
I mean, there's one guarding Darktow.

707
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,440
LAURA: That's true.
TRAVIS: That's right, yeah.

708
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,546
There's a percentage, a rev share,

709
00:26:56,546 --> 00:26:58,450
that goes to the DT.

710
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,320
So maybe if we say: Hey!

711
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,140
This son of a bitch has got all your loot!

712
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,266
SAM: Fjord, are you all right?
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm okay.

713
00:27:04,266 --> 00:27:07,334
(laughter)

714
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,757
ASHLEY: You're saying so many words today.

715
00:27:08,757 --> 00:27:12,250
TRAVIS: Yeah, we could say, like,
"Hey, come get all the gold!"

716
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,044
LIAM: Your accent work never disappoints.

717
00:27:14,044 --> 00:27:15,309
TRAVIS: Yes.

718
00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:16,920
Nothing but not consistent.

719
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,472
TALIESIN: Maybe a split. Partners.

720
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:22,690
MARISHA: Wait.

721
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:24,060
LAURA: A split?
SAM: Go into a partnership.

722
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,790
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LAURA: Like 50/50 (British accent) gold?

723
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,630
Whoa.
(laughter)

724
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:29,463
LAURA: Oh, no!

725
00:27:29,463 --> 00:27:33,048
What's happening right now?
(laughter)

726
00:27:33,048 --> 00:27:34,160
SAM: Technically, technically!
LAURA: Technically.

727
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,350
TRAVIS: Is the oxygen turned down in here?

728
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,423
MATT: No!

729
00:27:37,423 --> 00:27:38,772
ASHLEY: No, I think I made the table go cold.

730
00:27:38,772 --> 00:27:39,789
LAURA: Oh, god!

731
00:27:39,789 --> 00:27:41,760
(laughter)

732
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,750
TRAVIS: NordVPN, annihilating accents.

733
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,750
ASHLEY: Nord by Nordwest.
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

734
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,930
Okay, so should I give this a go, then?

735
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,470
SAM: The only thing that we need to decide--

736
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,550
The answer is yes, but--

737
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,660
LAURA: Okay!
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm?

738
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,960
SAM: The only thing we need to decide is,

739
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,840
are we going to approach Terra at the village first?

740
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,800
Or should we put this plan in motion first

741
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,490
because it'll take him some travel time?

742
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,130
LIAM: We don't know how long it will take

743
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:09,120
for D Turtle to arrive, so perhaps we want to be rested

744
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,123
and prepared and on location.

745
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:13,120
ASHLEY: Wait, did he take out our ship?
LAURA: In case he shows up

746
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,080
right away?
TALIESIN: He did.

747
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,500
ASHLEY: So he might be close.

748
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,850
LIAM: Maybe it'd take him a couple of hours,

749
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:17,800
or half a day or a day?

750
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,633
I have no idea where--

751
00:28:18,633 --> 00:28:20,020
LAURA: Well then, maybe I should send a message

752
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,620
early in the morning, or I should send a message

753
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,930
right before we go to sleep, or like--?

754
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:23,870
SAM: I feel like you should do it now,

755
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,060
at least to gauge where is he?

756
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,970
LIAM: What if he tears into there when we are not there?

757
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,280
SAM: Well, just to gauge.

758
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,100
Like, she could say, "Hey, remember me?"

759
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,780
TRAVIS: "How far are you?"
SAM: "How far away are you?

760
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,290
"You interested in some treasure?"

761
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,810
LIAM: Or you have a lead on treasure

762
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:42,691
and will tell more.

763
00:28:42,691 --> 00:28:44,050
LAURA: I feel like it's going to work better

764
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:46,480
if I'm not sending multiple messages

765
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,630
going, "Hey, guess what?"

766
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,711
TRAVIS: I thought you said you talk to him all the time.

767
00:28:50,711 --> 00:28:52,640
LAURA: (spluttering) I do.

768
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,470
But about other things, you know.

769
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,130
So this would be, like--

770
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,070
He would probably see--

771
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,100
I don't really talk to him that much.

772
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,590
TRAVIS: Oh.

773
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:05,423
Huh.

774
00:29:05,423 --> 00:29:07,750
One thing against talking to Terra,

775
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,300
we're going to run out of components soon

776
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,396
in order to do Greater Restorations, right?

777
00:29:11,396 --> 00:29:13,770
MARISHA: I feel like Terra's kind of a wild card.

778
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:16,990
We don't know how she's going to respond or act.

779
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:17,823
I don't know.

780
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:22,691
I say we stay here, see what D Timberlake wants.

781
00:29:22,691 --> 00:29:24,600
LAURA: What? We go!

782
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,317
We get Terra. We be like--

783
00:29:27,317 --> 00:29:28,600
Because it'd be like you, Vilya, right?

784
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,760
Where you were like, "Don't touch me!"

785
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,082
And then as soon as we did, you were like, "Oh, hey."

786
00:29:32,082 --> 00:29:33,890
SAM: (laughs)

787
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:35,360
MATT: "Do I sound like that?"

788
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,200
LAURA: Well, sometimes.
MATT: "Okay, all right.

789
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,423
"Sorry. Just a moment there.

790
00:29:39,423 --> 00:29:40,400
"It could be.

791
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,335
"I don't know Terra outside of the village."

792
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,000
TRAVIS: Who was here first, you or her?

793
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,518
MATT: "Terra came after.

794
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:51,523
"But...

795
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,300
"what worries me, and something to be aware of

796
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,120
"even if we succeed at all this--"

797
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,399
TRAVIS: This amazing plan?
MATT: "This amazing plan."

798
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,290
(laughter)

799
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:07,540
"Everyone in the village works together well

800
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,840
"because they've known nothing but the village.

801
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:12,320
"We don't know who these people were

802
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,020
"before they found their way here."

803
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,250
MARISHA: Exactly.

804
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:19,600
MATT: "And we don't know who
they're going to become when freed."

805
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,420
TRAVIS: Jesus, that's ominous.
SAM: So we could switch Terra

806
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,440
and find out that Terra's a total d-bag.

807
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,340
MATT: "Or could be an amazing ally.

808
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,560
"I don't know, I'm just saying,

809
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,870
"my concern, having been through this process,

810
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:35,290
"is I do not know who these people are

811
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:37,700
"beyond their persona here at the village."

812
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,540
LIAM: Yeah, and on a side note, there could be

813
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,020
some very awkward conversations

814
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,470
between the people who have had children

815
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:43,870
since arriving here.
LAURA: Yeah.

816
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:46,290
Like, what if they have families outside of the village?

817
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,127
LIAM: Ding, ding.

818
00:30:47,127 --> 00:30:48,343
TRAVIS: Ooh.
TALIESIN: Wow.

819
00:30:48,343 --> 00:30:50,318
MATT: "Well, that's going to have to

820
00:30:50,318 --> 00:30:51,700
"come to a head regardless,

821
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,810
"if we succeed.

822
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,080
"It's just deciding if you want

823
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,190
"to try and recruit aid from others.

824
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:03,074
"One, ensure how many of your components

825
00:31:03,074 --> 00:31:05,091
"you still have to be able to do that.

826
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,313
"Because that's one

827
00:31:07,313 --> 00:31:10,030
"taking away from a night or two's rest for us,

828
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,498
"and we don't know what we're going to get."

829
00:31:12,498 --> 00:31:13,331
LAURA: (huffing)

830
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:14,770
MARISHA: Feels like too much of a risk.

831
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:16,490
TALIESIN: It's a big risk.
LAURA: All right.

832
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:18,380
MARISHA: For a little bit of additional aid.

833
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:21,010
LAURA: Let's just send that message to him.

834
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,385
SAM: To the D Turtle?

835
00:31:22,385 --> 00:31:24,469
LAURA: No, to Vokodo. Yes, to the D Turtle.

836
00:31:24,469 --> 00:31:25,310
SAM: Oh, thank you, yes.

837
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,120
Sure, yeah, let's do it.

838
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,580
Today?
TALIESIN: It's a wild card.

839
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,131
TRAVIS: It was your idea, go for it.

840
00:31:30,131 --> 00:31:31,930
LAURA: (squealing)

841
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,463
SAM: Do you need to rehearse?

842
00:31:33,463 --> 00:31:34,296
LAURA: Okay.

843
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:40,380
Hey, dragon turtle...

844
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,230
I think I got it.
SAM: (laughs)

845
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:45,180
MARISHA: Great rehearsal.
SAM: Good run-through.

846
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,781
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Shot through rehearsal.

847
00:31:46,781 --> 00:31:48,497
(laughter)

848
00:31:48,497 --> 00:31:50,172
TALIESIN: Felt that, felt true.

849
00:31:50,172 --> 00:31:51,638
LIAM: I thought we were shooting the rehearsal.

850
00:31:51,638 --> 00:31:52,610
(laughter)

851
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:55,330
MATT: Vilya nods and tilts her head in the way

852
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,610
that a dog that hears a strange sound does, like, "Hmm."

853
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:01,210
LAURA: We got this.

854
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,440
You know what, this is kind of important.

855
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,819
Maybe I shouldn't just wing it.

856
00:32:03,819 --> 00:32:04,652
MARISHA: Yeah.

857
00:32:04,652 --> 00:32:06,090
Which tactic do you want to go with?

858
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,880
LAURA: I don't know which kind of tactic I want to use!

859
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,300
Do I want to use a tactic where I'm like,

860
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,660
"I just found a whole bunch of ships!

861
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,610
"Do you want them?"

862
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:16,030
Or do I use the tactic like, "Hey.

863
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,680
"I thought you were a badass,

864
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,190
"and there's this other guy here

865
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,690
"that's got all of these ships.

866
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,550
"What the fuck?"
TRAVIS: Dragons are greedy

867
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,640
and egotistical, right?

868
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,760
So we should appeal to that side of it.

869
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,710
So, like--
MARISHA: So, poke the turtle.

870
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:31,420
Number two!
LAURA: Poke the turtle.

871
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,253
LIAM: Oh, boy.

872
00:32:32,253 --> 00:32:33,570
If I may.
LAURA: Yeah?

873
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:36,480
LIAM: Traveler be with us. Go ahead.

874
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,770
LAURA: Okay. (inhales)

875
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:40,790
Traveler. Be with us.

876
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:43,220
Okay. I'm going to cast Sending.

877
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,353
Get ready to count.

878
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:47,370
MARISHA: Don't fuck this up.

879
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:48,203
LAURA: Okay.
ASHLEY: You got this.

880
00:32:48,203 --> 00:32:49,280
TRAVIS: I'm never very good at counting.

881
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,615
LAURA: I cast Sending.
MATT: All right.

882
00:32:51,615 --> 00:32:54,530
TRAVIS: I really should have a stenographer.
LIAM: Okay, it's for realsies now.

883
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:58,331
LAURA: Hey, it's me!

884
00:32:59,471 --> 00:33:01,063
You destroyed our ship,

885
00:33:02,896 --> 00:33:04,413
but don't worry about it.

886
00:33:04,413 --> 00:33:05,433
SAM: (laughs)

887
00:33:05,433 --> 00:33:09,142
LAURA: Because we know a guy who's got, like,

888
00:33:09,142 --> 00:33:11,166
a hundred ships here.

889
00:33:13,465 --> 00:33:17,480
I thought you...

890
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,313
were--

891
00:33:21,621 --> 00:33:23,590
SAM: Is that it, really?
LAURA: I'm going to cast another one.

892
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,423
SAM: Okay. (laughs)

893
00:33:24,423 --> 00:33:26,120
MATT: How quickly after?
LAURA: Immediately!

894
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,590
MATT: Okay.

895
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:31,679
LAURA: -- supposed to be great and stuff.

896
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,295
How come this guy has so many more ships than you?

897
00:33:34,295 --> 00:33:35,610
MARISHA: Tell him where we are!

898
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:38,050
LAURA: We're at Rumblecusp, by the way.

899
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:40,003
It's the volcano island.

900
00:33:44,175 --> 00:33:45,508
See you, maybe!

901
00:33:45,508 --> 00:33:47,170
(laughter)

902
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:49,090
LIAM: Do you have one more in you?

903
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,010
LAURA: I do.
MARISHA: Hey, hang on, wait!

904
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:51,200
LIAM: Wait, wait, wait!
MARISHA: Let's see what he says.

905
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,320
LAURA: I've got to wait for his response.

906
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,170
I need to wait.

907
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,380
LIAM: It's a big island.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

908
00:33:59,942 --> 00:34:01,690
LAURA: I'll wait, I'll wait.
TALIESIN: See if anything comes.

909
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:03,590
MATT: So you take a moment,

910
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,460
and eventually you begin to--

911
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,620
The Draconic language comes through,

912
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,420
translated through the spell,

913
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:14,830
so the ideas come to your mind

914
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:18,140
through the divine channel of the spell,

915
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,230
to loosely read as,

916
00:34:22,433 --> 00:34:24,997
"I took your ship.

917
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,891
"More.

918
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,246
"Where?

919
00:34:35,185 --> 00:34:40,066
"I like it easy pickings.

920
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:46,782
"Partway home already.

921
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:55,680
"Interested, maybe,"

922
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,072
and that's all you hear.

923
00:34:57,072 --> 00:34:58,740
LAURA: He's interested, maybe!

924
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,630
TRAVIS: Was it "on the way home already"?

925
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,922
LAURA: Yeah, he said he was on the way home already.

926
00:35:03,922 --> 00:35:05,980
(sighs)
ASHLEY: Maybe tell him there's lots of them.

927
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,070
Lots of ships.
TALIESIN: Lots of them.

928
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:10,860
Exactly where they are.
LIAM: Unguarded.

929
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:14,000
TALIESIN: Unguarded, and time is limited.

930
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,833
LAURA: Okay.

931
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:15,893
ASHLEY: Good, good, good, good.

932
00:35:15,893 --> 00:35:20,130
TALIESIN: Because we're going to take it and run soon.

933
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,660
LAURA: Okay.
SAM: That's a lot to fit in.

934
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:25,150
MARISHA: What side of the island is Heaven Falls on?

935
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:27,060
East side?
MATT: East side, yeah.

936
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,210
TALIESIN: East side of the island, behind the waterfall.

937
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,650
MARISHA: Behind the waterfall.

938
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:31,510
LAURA: With your spell

939
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:35,300
that you can make people understand things, languages?

940
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,133
LIAM: Yeah.

941
00:35:36,133 --> 00:35:38,000
LAURA: Is it only reading, or is it talking?

942
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,610
LIAM: Well, it's two separate things.

943
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:42,950
LAURA: Can you make me be able to talk his language?

944
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,570
LIAM: Tomorrow.
LAURA: Okay.

945
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:45,740
TRAVIS: That upside-down waterfall's

946
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:48,560
not going to uppercut him into the stratosphere, is it?

947
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,258
Like it did us?
MARISHA: (laughs)

948
00:35:50,258 --> 00:35:51,790
TRAVIS: (wailing)

949
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:54,290
LAURA: He's pretty big; I don't think it will do it to him.

950
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:55,980
TRAVIS: Okay, just checking.
MARISHA: But that would be funny.

951
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,270
TRAVIS: We'll know when he gets there!

952
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,259
(laughter)

953
00:35:58,259 --> 00:35:59,528
(moaning)

954
00:35:59,528 --> 00:36:00,920
LIAM: Oh, wait. No, no, no.

955
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,970
LAURA: You could do it?
LIAM: I can do it, yeah.

956
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:04,400
Because this is the same day

957
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,080
with the "everything is cake" tower that we...

958
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,976
MATT: Correct, yes.
LIAM: Yeah, I can do it.

959
00:36:08,976 --> 00:36:10,604
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Good ref.

960
00:36:10,604 --> 00:36:12,736
LAURA: Oh my gosh, okay, yeah!

961
00:36:12,736 --> 00:36:14,530
Cast it on me and then I'll be able to talk to him!

962
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:15,800
LIAM: Yeah, Jester, yeah, yeah, yeah...

963
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,770
Hold on. I'm just looking through D&D Beyond.

964
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:22,000
Where did you go?
LAURA: ♪ D&D! ♪

965
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,390
SAM: ♪ D&D Beyond! ♪
(laughter)

966
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,480
LIAM: Yeah.

967
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,970
So he pulls out a little stone tower

968
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,710
that you've seen once or twice,

969
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,100
and I hold it up,

970
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:38,980
and wave fingers at three points in front of your face

971
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,180
and cast Tongues on Jester.

972
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:45,800
So you can understand any spoken language you hear.

973
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,010
LAURA: Awesome, okay. I'm going--

974
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:50,320
LIAM: (American accent)
Can you understand what I'm saying right now?

975
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,270
LAURA: What the shit?!

976
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:52,790
What happened to your accent, Caleb?

977
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,915
LIAM: I don't have an accent.

978
00:36:54,915 --> 00:36:57,350
(laughter)

979
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:59,440
This is flawless Zemnian.

980
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,010
LAURA: Does that mean I'm speaking Zemnian?

981
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:04,379
(American accent) Does that mean I'm speaking Zemnian?

982
00:37:04,379 --> 00:37:07,518
(laughter)

983
00:37:07,518 --> 00:37:09,350
LIAM: (German accent) Is that what I
sound like most of the time?

984
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:12,096
SAM: Yeah, like sort of a Baltimore thing.

985
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:13,500
(laughter)

986
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,059
LIAM: Is that in the Empire?
SAM: Yeah.

987
00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:20,140
ASHLEY: It does sound just like that, though. That's weird.

988
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:23,524
LIAM: Well, it suits you.
LAURA: (laughs) Thank you.

989
00:37:23,524 --> 00:37:27,800
(laughter)

990
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,560
SAM: Say water. How do you say water?

991
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,722
LAURA: Water.
(laughter)

992
00:37:31,722 --> 00:37:34,224
SAM: I was expecting--
ASHLEY and SAM: Wudder.

993
00:37:34,224 --> 00:37:35,150
LIAM: The accent...

994
00:37:37,042 --> 00:37:40,638
it's cute.
(laughter)

995
00:37:40,638 --> 00:37:41,790
It's complicated.

996
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,460
LAURA: I'm speaking Zemnian right now.

997
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,460
Can you understand me, Fjord?

998
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,070
TRAVIS: Feel like she's spitting at me.

999
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,481
MARISHA: She sounds really angry, right?

1000
00:37:48,481 --> 00:37:49,380
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1001
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,640
MARISHA: I think she's pissed at you.

1002
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,120
LAURA: (Jester's accent)
Okay, I'm going to send a message to the turtle.

1003
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:57,248
TALIESIN: What are the points?
LAURA: Okay, the points are:

1004
00:37:57,248 --> 00:37:59,301
Easy pickings.

1005
00:37:59,301 --> 00:38:00,134
I'm going to say--

1006
00:38:00,134 --> 00:38:01,370
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1007
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:05,950
I'm going to say, lots of ships unguarded.

1008
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,100
Behind the upside-down waterfall.

1009
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,490
MARISHA: East side of the island.

1010
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:13,090
LAURA: East side of the island, upside-down waterfall.

1011
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,306
TALIESIN: Time is limited.

1012
00:38:14,306 --> 00:38:16,999
LAURA: Time is limited, 'cause these things are moving out!

1013
00:38:16,999 --> 00:38:19,400
TALIESIN: We're taking them tomorrow.
LAURA: Okay, well...

1014
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,580
TALIESIN: Taking them tomorrow afternoon.

1015
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:23,810
TRAVIS: Tomorrow morning.
TALIESIN: Tomorrow morning.

1016
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:24,740
LAURA: Okay.

1017
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,640
SAM: Your accent sounds like a British actor

1018
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,190
trying to do an American accent.

1019
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,260
It's really cool.
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

1020
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,050
TALIESIN: (exaggerated American accent)
I don't know what you mean.

1021
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:34,050
(laughter)

1022
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,400
TRAVIS: (same accent) Hamburger.

1023
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,830
ASHLEY: (same accent) Hamburger.

1024
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:40,066
SAM: (same accent) I'm an American fighter pilot.

1025
00:38:40,066 --> 00:38:43,172
(laughter)

1026
00:38:43,172 --> 00:38:44,988
Kind of sounds like us.

1027
00:38:44,988 --> 00:38:47,340
LAURA: Okay, okay.

1028
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,873
Going to cast Sending.
MATT: All right.

1029
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,650
MARISHA: You got this.

1030
00:38:55,780 --> 00:39:00,132
LAURA: There's lots of ships, unguarded,

1031
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:04,173
on the east side,

1032
00:39:04,173 --> 00:39:07,014
behind the upside-down waterfall.

1033
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:12,010
But move fast,

1034
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:15,301
'cause these things are

1035
00:39:15,301 --> 00:39:19,617
flying off the shelves tomorrow!

1036
00:39:19,617 --> 00:39:24,413
(laughter)
(applause)

1037
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,103
TALIESIN: Wow.

1038
00:39:27,561 --> 00:39:29,477
MATT: The response comes.

1039
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:36,484
"And why would you tell me this

1040
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:41,228
"after destroying your ship

1041
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:46,596
"and you left me an

1042
00:39:46,596 --> 00:39:49,537
"slimy slug?

1043
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:56,568
"I chased for days

1044
00:39:56,568 --> 00:39:59,126
"for vengeance."

1045
00:40:00,052 --> 00:40:01,400
That's the end of his response.

1046
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,460
MARISHA: Wow.
TALIESIN: Do we have another message?

1047
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,240
MARISHA: You're right. They can still hold a grudge.

1048
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,955
LAURA: Oh, wait.
MARISHA: Getting transformed--

1049
00:40:08,955 --> 00:40:10,840
LAURA: Not if I want to do Heroes' Feast tonight.

1050
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,180
TALIESIN: Oh.
LAURA: I got nothing.

1051
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,037
TRAVIS: That's all right. You've
got to leave them wanting more.

1052
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:17,760
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's like it's a--
LAURA: Maybe he's going to be curious.

1053
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,180
TRAVIS: Don't call him back after the first date.

1054
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:23,692
MATT: The tone-- while the voice sounds guttural,

1055
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:29,515
he doesn't sound like he's shut you down.

1056
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:33,070
He's just being careful.
LAURA: Yeah, understandably.

1057
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,500
MATT: While he's not an ancient
dragon in intelligence per se,

1058
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,220
he's lived long enough and dealt with enough

1059
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,710
of different dubious minds and deals and such

1060
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:46,168
that you get the sense that he's at least being careful.

1061
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,080
Smart enough not to just walk into a trap

1062
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,610
because someone told him to.
LAURA: Right.

1063
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:52,840
ASHLEY: I mean, worst comes to worst,

1064
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,606
we could totally fight

1065
00:40:55,606 --> 00:40:59,210
D-Turts and Vokodo.

1066
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:00,410
We're strong enough to do that.

1067
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:02,350
TRAVIS: At the same time?
SAM: I don't...

1068
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:04,141
Are you joking right now?

1069
00:41:04,141 --> 00:41:04,977
ASHLEY: Yes.

1070
00:41:04,977 --> 00:41:08,001
(laughter)

1071
00:41:08,001 --> 00:41:10,366
SAM: Your expression never changes, not even a little.

1072
00:41:10,366 --> 00:41:14,766
ASHLEY: No, I've been told I have a very dry sense of humor.

1073
00:41:14,766 --> 00:41:16,380
TRAVIS: Delivery is--
SAM: Wow!

1074
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:19,130
TRAVIS: -- quite plain.
SAM: Just one-liners.

1075
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:21,010
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah.
LIAM: Also, if I may,

1076
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:24,460
with the evolution of this dragon's name,

1077
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:27,248
I would recommend we call him Dieter.

1078
00:41:27,248 --> 00:41:28,245
LAURA: Dieter!
MARISHA: Dieter?

1079
00:41:28,245 --> 00:41:29,653
LIAM: Dieter.
SAM: Dieter.

1080
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,520
MARISHA: D-turd?
TALIESIN: Deter.

1081
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,890
LIAM: Dieter.
LAURA: No, Dieter.

1082
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:33,723
TALIESIN: Dieter.

1083
00:41:33,723 --> 00:41:35,800
TALIESIN: What does Dieter mean in Zemnian?

1084
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,430
LIAM: It's just a name.
TRAVIS: Oh, well, great.

1085
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:40,200
LIAM: It means dragon turtle.

1086
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,490
TALIESIN: Ah, convenient.

1087
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:45,400
MARISHA: I do like D-Turts, though. That's fun, too.

1088
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,820
That feels like he's a cool guy.

1089
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,580
He's a cool turts.
TALIESIN: Bit informal.

1090
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:52,123
LIAM: I would not know.
MARISHA: Let's go party at D-Turts'.

1091
00:41:52,123 --> 00:41:54,670
SAM: So, we've put the invitation out.

1092
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:55,590
Now what do we do?

1093
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:58,210
TALIESIN: We don't have one more Sending, do we?

1094
00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:01,000
LAURA: I could send a message in the morning, but...

1095
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,990
MARISHA: Well, maybe that's good.

1096
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:04,110
Maybe then we can gauge it in the morning.

1097
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:06,150
TRAVIS: "Oh, man, you guys. People are here early!

1098
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:08,396
"There's a line outside. You better hurry!"

1099
00:42:08,396 --> 00:42:12,779
(laughter)

1100
00:42:15,811 --> 00:42:16,700
This is great!

1101
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,550
What a good plan.
ASHLEY: I think it's a good plan.

1102
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,310
TRAVIS: We're going back to the village tonight?

1103
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:23,177
SAM: I don't know.
TALIESIN: I wouldn't.

1104
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,050
LAURA: Or do we just sleep here?

1105
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:27,950
Because, you know, the thing is,

1106
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:30,000
there's always a chance

1107
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,950
that Guacamole could get in everyone's heads

1108
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,060
a little bit stronger

1109
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:36,415
and they could attack us.
MARISHA: Yeah.

1110
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,550
LAURA: Maybe he can take control of people.

1111
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:42,570
Like, who knows what he can do?

1112
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:43,590
SAM: Would it be helpful at all

1113
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:46,260
to have our own crew mates with us on this journey?

1114
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:49,660
TRAVIS: Ooh. You mean Orly and Marius?

1115
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,020
TALIESIN: They're a bit squishy.

1116
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,390
LIAM: Yeah.
SAM: Well, yes,

1117
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:54,780
but, I mean, as a distraction or something.

1118
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,038
ASHLEY: Marius would surely die instantly.
TRAVIS: That's a little harsh.

1119
00:42:57,038 --> 00:42:58,796
SAM: Well, or because

1120
00:42:58,796 --> 00:43:00,800
we're going to be commandeering

1121
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,180
a whole bunch of vessels, possibly.

1122
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,870
MARISHA: Another interesting point.

1123
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:08,140
We're going to have to kill Vokodo

1124
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,030
in order for them to remember us.

1125
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:11,421
TALIESIN: Yep.
LAURA: Yeah.

1126
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,770
MATT: "Well, they've only been here for a day.

1127
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:18,668
"We can't be certain until we get to them."

1128
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:23,590
(laughter)

1129
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:25,010
TRAVIS: Why?

1130
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:26,330
Oh, shit!
MARISHA: Oh, shit, ahh!

1131
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:31,210
MATT: "Regardless, if we're relying on my capabilities

1132
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:34,690
"to bring us close to the outside of the mountain,

1133
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:37,560
"whether it be near the Heaven Falls

1134
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,077
"or the first entrance that I took you,

1135
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,860
"that expends the most powerful magic

1136
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:45,120
"I have at my disposal that day."

1137
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,190
SAM: Got it.
LAURA: Oh, so do it tonight.

1138
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:48,580
SAM: So we should go where we're going to and halt.

1139
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,550
MATT: "Or, if it works best, I can take you the day of.

1140
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:54,340
"Just know, that does diminish my capabilities somewhat."

1141
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,990
LAURA: Are you going to fight with us?

1142
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:58,050
MATT: "I assumed I was, unless you wish otherwise."

1143
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:59,960
LAURA: No, we would love it.
TALIESIN: That would be very helpful.

1144
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,880
LAURA: I just don't want to put you into that position,

1145
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,350
if you didn't want to.
TRAVIS: I do.

1146
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,910
I really want to put you in that position.

1147
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:08,790
SAM: No, no, no, don't listen to Fjord.
TRAVIS: Quite powerful.

1148
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:09,730
SAM: You have a family at home

1149
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,340
that you need to think about as well.

1150
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,970
MATT: "I do, but right now

1151
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:14,940
"I have a family I've made here on this island

1152
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,120
"that I still feel responsible for."

1153
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,828
SAM: You consider us a family that fast?
LAURA: (laughs)

1154
00:44:19,828 --> 00:44:21,340
MATT: "Sure. Um..."

1155
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:22,320
TRAVIS: (laughs)

1156
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,870
MARISHA: Do you have kids here?
MATT: "No."

1157
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:25,703
MARISHA: Oh.

1158
00:44:25,703 --> 00:44:27,920
MATT: "But there are many good people here,

1159
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,680
"at least good for the time that I've known them,

1160
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:36,680
"and I don't want them damned to this life without choice."

1161
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:38,270
LIAM: They say the V.O. community

1162
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:39,921
is full of some of the best people you will find.

1163
00:44:39,921 --> 00:44:42,179
SAM: True, it's true.
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1164
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,750
LAURA: (laughs)
TRAVIS: I know we have two entrances

1165
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:47,450
and we had talked about coming in from two different sides,

1166
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:50,220
or do we want to hedge our bets,

1167
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,737
or not hedge our bets, and go in through one?

1168
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:57,930
Do we want to split up and come in from that...

1169
00:44:59,724 --> 00:45:00,557
TALIESIN: I don't know. I feel like

1170
00:45:00,557 --> 00:45:05,107
if he can really see us at all times,

1171
00:45:05,107 --> 00:45:09,872
which I guess he can, it's not like we can hide.

1172
00:45:09,872 --> 00:45:13,490
LAURA: We can't sneak up on him.
TALIESIN: So there's no sneaking up.

1173
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:15,970
So we either go in the way we know,

1174
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:19,910
or go in this new way, but I wouldn't...

1175
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:21,210
I don't know.

1176
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:24,140
It just seems...
MARISHA: Do any of you all

1177
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:28,230
have any type of magic that would help with that?

1178
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:29,980
TALIESIN: I mean...
TRAVIS: You mean cloak our...?

1179
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:31,422
TALIESIN: What kind of magic?

1180
00:45:32,261 --> 00:45:35,577
ASHLEY: Keep us hidden.
MARISHA: Force field cloaking magic?

1181
00:45:35,577 --> 00:45:37,110
(laughter)
TALIESIN: I genuinely don't know

1182
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:38,400
how he's doing this,

1183
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,910
so I don't have anything.

1184
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:41,840
SAM: Yeah, I mean, I can turn invisible for a short time,

1185
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,700
but I don't know if he can see our essence

1186
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,402
or hear us or feel us, or...

1187
00:45:45,402 --> 00:45:47,370
LAURA: He can't hear us.
SAM: He can't hear us?

1188
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:48,203
LAURA: No.

1189
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:50,180
LIAM: We believe he cannot hear us.

1190
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,160
LAURA: We don't think he can.

1191
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,200
SAM: But if it's just purely visual, I mean.

1192
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,010
Some of us can become invisible, correct?

1193
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:58,650
MARISHA: It's true.
TALIESIN: Assuming that works.

1194
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:01,263
MARISHA: You could try it.

1195
00:46:01,263 --> 00:46:02,600
Can you go invisible tonight and see

1196
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,010
if you still feel that tingling sensation

1197
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:07,460
like you're being watched?
LAURA: Didn't you do it before?

1198
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:08,293
You did it already.

1199
00:46:08,293 --> 00:46:09,980
SAM: I think I was invisible for a time.

1200
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,140
LAURA: And you still felt it.

1201
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:12,850
I think I remember.
SAM: Did I?

1202
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:14,195
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1203
00:46:14,195 --> 00:46:18,962
MATT: The sensation of proximity,

1204
00:46:18,962 --> 00:46:20,453
being watched,

1205
00:46:20,453 --> 00:46:22,932
did not diminish when you were invisible.

1206
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:28,087
SAM: Well, either way, shouldn't we be near the ships

1207
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,230
for when the dragon--
LIAM: I think so.

1208
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:32,063
SAM: -- Dieter comes?

1209
00:46:32,063 --> 00:46:34,510
LIAM: Because Dieter is either coming or not,

1210
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:36,020
and if he comes and wrecks things

1211
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:37,170
and we are lucky enough

1212
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:39,940
to have Vokodo leave his lair and exit,

1213
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:40,830
if we are not there,

1214
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:43,972
then we're not going to be able to take advantage of it.

1215
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,790
TRAVIS: How would Vokodo leave?

1216
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:51,470
Through the tunnel, the first entrance that we went through?

1217
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:52,780
The ship entrance?

1218
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,790
Or is he going to...

1219
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:56,750
LAURA: Who knows?
SAM: You mean leave permanently?

1220
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:58,506
TRAVIS: Like, if he flees his lair...
LAURA: Oh my god.

1221
00:46:58,506 --> 00:47:00,560
What if he climbs up and out of the volcano

1222
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,830
and he comes out the top of it?

1223
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:02,840
How cool would that be?

1224
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:05,230
TRAVIS: I mean, he may just stay, but if he goes...

1225
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:06,730
I'm just trying to think it out.

1226
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:10,160
We're not going to set off a tremendous volcanic explosion

1227
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,552
and kill everyone on the island, are we?

1228
00:47:11,552 --> 00:47:12,577
ASHLEY: Ugh.

1229
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:15,750
SAM: Who knows?
TRAVIS: We have no way to know.

1230
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:16,820
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1231
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:17,810
TRAVIS: I suppose if he flees

1232
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:19,760
through the first entrance we went through

1233
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,590
and we're at the ship tunnels,

1234
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:23,340
then he would be on the other side of the mountain,

1235
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,260
and we wouldn't really be able to help.

1236
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:29,335
MARISHA: Also, does Vokodo even care about the ships?

1237
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:32,050
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Hard to say.

1238
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:32,883
I think he does

1239
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:35,130
in terms of keeping people on the island, right?

1240
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:37,220
TALIESIN: But why not just destroy
them instead of hoarding them?

1241
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:41,210
SAM: Well, speaking as a hoarder myself,

1242
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:43,060
I've collected things all my life,

1243
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:47,020
and this gentleman Vokodo seems...

1244
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:49,780
I mean, I have a kinship with him,

1245
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:54,780
because he keeps a lot of wonderful, shiny objects

1246
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,420
around him at all times,

1247
00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:00,880
and I've had that same passion my whole life,

1248
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,370
and if these ships are part of his collection,

1249
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:04,940
he won't want to part with them.

1250
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:06,700
He won't want to see them destroyed.

1251
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,720
LIAM: And it seems he wants things of value,

1252
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,700
and a means of escaping the island

1253
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:14,900
are all of these people's valuable asset.

1254
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,910
Probably the only reason he does not have them

1255
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:19,400
in his chamber with him is because of their size,

1256
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,940
so he has them as close as possible, perhaps.

1257
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,378
TRAVIS: Seems like the best bet, then.

1258
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,400
TALIESIN: So, if we stay at that end,

1259
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:32,340
see if we can get the dragon turtle

1260
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:35,260
in the cave, doing damage.
LAURA: Dragon turtle,

1261
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:37,210
attacking the butthole.

1262
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:41,030
TALIESIN: And then we can come
in once that starts going down.

1263
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:44,640
MARISHA: And maybe if he doesn't come out,

1264
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,940
Vokodo isn't lured out,

1265
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:49,090
maybe then we can make the dragon turtle smaller

1266
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:53,090
and send him further up the bloodstream, maybe.

1267
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:57,150
LIAM: Or grab him like a package and bring him in.

1268
00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:00,050
That's insane, but it could work.

1269
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:01,800
MARISHA: But I like it.
ASHLEY: I like it, too.

1270
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:04,030
TRAVIS: This is a great plan.
MARISHA: I like it.

1271
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:05,140
SAM: This is a great plan!

1272
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:07,600
LIAM: So maybe we make our way there tonight,

1273
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:12,600
and we camp on ships towards the rear of the impound lot

1274
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:15,500
near the entrance to the butthole?

1275
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,850
MARISHA: Okay.
SAM: And time permitting,

1276
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:19,390
maybe we could even, if there's room

1277
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:21,340
in that vast cavern where the ships were,

1278
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:22,270
maybe we could sort of

1279
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:25,818
hide one off to the side for ourself?

1280
00:49:27,468 --> 00:49:29,152
TALIESIN: (hums) I would recommend

1281
00:49:29,152 --> 00:49:34,152
we not be seen staging the

1282
00:49:34,869 --> 00:49:35,960
territory, so to speak.

1283
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,180
TRAVIS: We also have to control the water long enough

1284
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:41,537
to get a ship, a big ship, through,

1285
00:49:41,537 --> 00:49:43,040
and not have the spell falter

1286
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,180
because then, goodbye ship.

1287
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:46,400
SAM: All right.

1288
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,730
Well, then, let's just get there.

1289
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:50,240
MARISHA: Okay.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1290
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,430
MATT: "All right, then."

1291
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:53,200
SAM: To Heaven's Fall.

1292
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,370
Heaven Falls?
MATT: "Heaven Falls.

1293
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:57,240
"I gather we'll take a tree

1294
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,733
"nearby where we camped the night before?"

1295
00:50:00,733 --> 00:50:01,699
SAM: Sure.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1296
00:50:01,699 --> 00:50:02,532
MATT: "(sighs) It's been a while.

1297
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:03,370
"Follow me."

1298
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:04,500
You see she rubs her hands,

1299
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:09,330
and takes a step towards one of the larger trees,

1300
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:11,340
just as you guys have stepped into the jungle

1301
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:14,410
past the elements where the wilds begin to wither

1302
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:18,835
and you bypassed the sentient,

1303
00:50:18,835 --> 00:50:21,552
undead large trees that you had snuck past.

1304
00:50:21,552 --> 00:50:23,290
Once you go beyond that space,

1305
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:27,760
you come to the first pack of healthy, thick-rooted trees

1306
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,780
in the middle of the jungle there.

1307
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:32,500
Vilya approaches, rubs her hands,

1308
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,880
takes her staff and runs it

1309
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,460
in a diagonal line across the trunk, and as it does,

1310
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:41,535
you see this faint light green, gold sparkle.

1311
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:43,910
Shh, like a zipper, begin to pull down.

1312
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:46,601
As it does, it opens into this oval, shimmering doorway,

1313
00:50:46,601 --> 00:50:49,509
As it does, it opens into this oval, shimmering doorway,

1314
00:50:49,509 --> 00:50:52,480
and on the other side, you can immediately see

1315
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,720
about three or four feet of what looks like carved wood,

1316
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,810
almost like there's a tunnel.

1317
00:50:57,810 --> 00:51:00,610
There's a walled tunnel of smooth wood

1318
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:02,490
where you can see the striations and rings

1319
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:03,970
on the interior of the tree,

1320
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:07,676
and on the other side, white beach and an ocean.

1321
00:51:07,676 --> 00:51:10,090
LAURA: (gasping)
ASHLEY: That is so cool.

1322
00:51:10,090 --> 00:51:11,238
MATT: "Quickly, please."
LAURA: Oh, oh, okay!

1323
00:51:11,238 --> 00:51:13,057
SAM: Oh, yes. Go, go, go, go, go!

1324
00:51:13,057 --> 00:51:14,430
TRAVIS: Thought she was full of shit.

1325
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:15,710
MATT: As you all rush through,

1326
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:17,030
there's a brief moment,

1327
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:19,160
a similar rush sensation,

1328
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,710
though much shorter than the one you're familiar with

1329
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:24,050
with Teleportation via Caleb.

1330
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:27,870
And as you step out, your feet find the soft, hot sand

1331
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:31,340
on the white beaches on the eastern shore of Rumblecusp.

1332
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:33,997
And just as you all emerge and you watch Vilya escape,

1333
00:51:33,997 --> 00:51:36,230
(whooshing)
it closes behind her

1334
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:38,980
and just the tree trunk of one of the palms there

1335
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:40,640
is left like nothing had happened.

1336
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,820
LAURA: That was awesome!
ASHLEY: That is a very cool trick.

1337
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:43,653
TALIESIN: That's amazing.

1338
00:51:43,653 --> 00:51:44,486
LAURA: What would happen

1339
00:51:44,486 --> 00:51:45,820
if you were halfway through the tree when it closed?

1340
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:47,120
Would you get cut in half?

1341
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:50,026
MATT: "Let's hope we never find out."

1342
00:51:50,026 --> 00:51:50,859
LAURA: (exclaims)

1343
00:51:50,859 --> 00:51:53,150
ASHLEY: Just mummified in the tree? Petrified?

1344
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:54,250
LAURA: Like, just a hand's...

1345
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:55,580
MATT: "I'm sure it's happened.

1346
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:58,470
"I've been careful before."
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1347
00:51:58,470 --> 00:52:00,750
MARISHA: Maybe that's how faces get trees.

1348
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,517
How trees get faces.
TRAVIS: How faces get trees!

1349
00:52:03,517 --> 00:52:05,817
(laughter)
Holy shit.

1350
00:52:05,817 --> 00:52:07,540
(laughter)

1351
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:09,910
ASHLEY: What's weird is it totally made sense to me.

1352
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:11,626
I was like, "Yeah, you're right."
MARISHA: Yasha was on

1353
00:52:11,626 --> 00:52:13,659
the same page, okay?
ASHLEY: Same page.

1354
00:52:13,659 --> 00:52:15,570
MARISHA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: (laughs)

1355
00:52:16,556 --> 00:52:19,270
MATT: You can hear the distant sound of the Heaven Falls

1356
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:20,980
crashing not far from here.

1357
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:22,010
You are at the exact beach

1358
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:23,730
where you guys had rested the night before.

1359
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,370
So you still have an afternoon.

1360
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:27,950
If there's any further planning you want to do,

1361
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:30,350
you guys can discuss or set up for the night.

1362
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:32,025
The evening's yours, so...

1363
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:35,080
LIAM: Did we ever take a short rest?

1364
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,530
MATT: Not since you left the Ruin.
SAM: Let's do that.

1365
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:39,105
MATT: I don't believe so.

1366
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,060
TRAVIS: Short rest?
LIAM: Yeah, I would like to.

1367
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:44,440
LAURA: I don't think we did.

1368
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,530
We might have done it...

1369
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:47,120
No, I think we did it right after

1370
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,370
when we were at the Ruins, we did it.

1371
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:50,510
When we were searching everything.

1372
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:51,650
MATT: That's correct, that's correct.

1373
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:53,962
ASHLEY: We did, yeah.

1374
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:54,955
LIAM: Okay.

1375
00:52:54,955 --> 00:52:57,090
SAM: Well, what other preparations do we need?

1376
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,300
Do we need to go into the cavern

1377
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,520
and sort of get a lay of the land,

1378
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,720
figure out where we're going to be?

1379
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,578
TRAVIS: Anything changed from the last time

1380
00:53:04,578 --> 00:53:06,753
that we were here that we can see?

1381
00:53:06,753 --> 00:53:09,160
MATT: Make a perception or investigation check.

1382
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,830
TRAVIS: Investigation, please.

1383
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:13,830
Ooh, 25.

1384
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:15,780
MATT: 25.

1385
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:16,750
Glancing about the sands,

1386
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:18,520
you can see the tracks left behind.

1387
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,600
You can see the indentations

1388
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:21,760
where you guys spent the evening,

1389
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,700
though it looks like a bit of the seaside wind

1390
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,240
has blown some elements of sand

1391
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:29,930
to soften the impact of where bodies lied.

1392
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:31,700
But nothing seems to be disturbed

1393
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:35,303
beyond the tracks you left when you made your way.

1394
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:39,380
TRAVIS: Seems safe.
LAURA: Oh, man.

1395
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:40,530
TALIESIN: This could be where you set up

1396
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:44,460
the Welcome to Traveler Con.
LAURA: Oh, yeah!

1397
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:45,590
TALIESIN: Be a nice beach.
LAURA: That'd be really nice.

1398
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:47,980
TALIESIN: Show up and give everybody a badge.

1399
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:49,450
LAURA: I just realized, you guys.

1400
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:54,220
I can't control the water to get back into the cavern.

1401
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:57,103
TRAVIS: I can.
LAURA: Oh, okay.

1402
00:53:58,245 --> 00:54:00,453
Good. (laughs)

1403
00:54:00,453 --> 00:54:02,180
MATT: All right. You guys heading back to the falls, then?

1404
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:03,600
LIAM: I think we should, yeah.

1405
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:07,080
I think we should bed down in there for the night,

1406
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,760
because if he's with us at all times,

1407
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,510
it will seem like perhaps we are just finding shelter.

1408
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:15,830
He knows that we're doing something,

1409
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:17,230
but it would seem...

1410
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:18,920
I don't think we should monkey with any boats,

1411
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,800
as Caduceus said.

1412
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,020
Should just look like we're sheltering for the night,

1413
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:25,230
and then maybe thinking of coming

1414
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:26,480
to give him an offering or something.

1415
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,660
SAM: If we go back in there,

1416
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:30,090
Caduceus, will you be able to control your urges

1417
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:32,730
to swim down and through?
TALIESIN: No.

1418
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:35,223
SAM: All right.
TALIESIN: No, I'll be fine.

1419
00:54:35,223 --> 00:54:37,170
(laughter)

1420
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:38,724
SAM: Yasha, just in case?

1421
00:54:38,724 --> 00:54:41,307
MARISHA: (clears her throat)

1422
00:54:41,307 --> 00:54:42,740
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SAM: Just get ready.

1423
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:43,620
ASHLEY: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Not to kill him.

1424
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:45,080
ASHLEY: Just knock him out?
TRAVIS: Not kill, yeah.

1425
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:45,913
ASHLEY: No, no, no, no, no.

1426
00:54:45,913 --> 00:54:47,780
SAM: Do what you have to do.
ASHLEY: Just a "Go to sleep."

1427
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:48,613
TRAVIS: That'd be sufficient.

1428
00:54:48,613 --> 00:54:49,770
"Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep."

1429
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:52,410
ASHLEY: We could tie a rope around each other, you know.

1430
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:53,630
SAM: Oh, yeah!
ASHLEY: So we're sleeping,

1431
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:56,690
if one goes, we all go.
TALIESIN: That tends to go well.

1432
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:58,167
SAM: Sure.
LAURA: Yeah!

1433
00:54:58,167 --> 00:54:59,957
(laughter)

1434
00:54:59,957 --> 00:55:02,074
TRAVIS: When has that never not worked out?

1435
00:55:02,074 --> 00:55:04,596
(laughter)

1436
00:55:04,596 --> 00:55:06,580
MATT: All right, so you guys wade your way back out

1437
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:11,580
into the open lagoon that leads towards the Heaven Falls.

1438
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:16,400
Approaching, as you get closer and closer to it,

1439
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,420
the water itself still firing up with the same intensity

1440
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:21,180
that it previously has.
TRAVIS: Yep, yep.

1441
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:23,140
MATT: You have use of Control Water, you said?

1442
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:23,973
TRAVIS: I do.

1443
00:55:23,973 --> 00:55:26,830
LAURA: I point out to Fjord where he should do it

1444
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:30,550
so that it does the least amount of damage to us

1445
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:33,290
as we go through it.
TRAVIS: And do you split it?

1446
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:34,460
Do you put it off to the left or right?

1447
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:35,580
You just stopped it entirely?

1448
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,260
What did you do?
LAURA: I split it, but, you know,

1449
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,070
you might be able to just put it off to the side

1450
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:41,550
if we go into the side of the cavern.

1451
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:44,213
That might be easier, I'm not sure.

1452
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:46,670
TRAVIS: Whatever you think will work.

1453
00:55:47,806 --> 00:55:49,828
I only can do it one time.

1454
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:52,337
LAURA: Just try it from the side.

1455
00:55:52,337 --> 00:55:54,090
TRAVIS: Okay, I'll--
LAURA: Maybe that's better.

1456
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:56,215
TRAVIS: Side, yeah. So I'll walk up and--
MATT: Okay.

1457
00:55:56,215 --> 00:55:58,680
TRAVIS: Literally try and shift so that one side becomes open.

1458
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,055
MATT: All right. You guys watch as Fjord

1459
00:56:01,055 --> 00:56:03,155
wades out a little further,

1460
00:56:03,155 --> 00:56:04,820
putting his hand forward and concentrating.

1461
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:08,580
The large, solid beam of water

1462
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:10,940
begins to--
(rushing water)

1463
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:12,440
And shift to one side.

1464
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:15,650
As it does, you can now see the wetted cliff-side

1465
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:18,680
atop that is left to glisten under the sun,

1466
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:20,900
and the water is now firing off

1467
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,950
and spraying somewhere in the jungle

1468
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:24,930
down the southern side of where it once was,

1469
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:28,220
and you can see now the cliff-face behind it

1470
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:31,333
is now exposed and seemingly safe to traverse.

1471
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:34,320
TALIESIN: Somewhere there's a very soggy tyrannosaurus.

1472
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,120
TRAVIS: Not a problem.
TALIESIN: Yep, going.

1473
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:36,953
TRAVIS: Yep.
MATT: All right.

1474
00:56:36,953 --> 00:56:38,090
One by one, you all make your way

1475
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:41,340
into the familiar interior of the tunnel without issue.

1476
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:43,920
You all take a wide berth

1477
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,320
to not be pulled into the rapid current

1478
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,410
that is immediately around

1479
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:49,260
where it's breaking the water's surface.

1480
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:51,420
MARISHA: It's tempting, though!
MATT: It is tempting.

1481
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:53,350
Then you come into the darkened chamber,

1482
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:55,800
the familiar sounds of water droplets all around you,

1483
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,490
and you can see, in the space,

1484
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:02,620
the shape of all the various ships as you left them.

1485
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:03,910
But the cavern is yours.

1486
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:07,930
MARISHA: What time is it? Still afternoon?

1487
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:08,763
MATT: Still afternoon.

1488
00:57:08,763 --> 00:57:09,630
You guys have time,

1489
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:11,460
but you don't have to spend the afternoon

1490
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:12,293
if you want to jump ahead.

1491
00:57:12,293 --> 00:57:13,610
You can just say the things you want to do

1492
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:15,150
and then continue from there.

1493
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:16,950
LAURA: I thought it was later in the day.

1494
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:19,930
I thought it was getting evening

1495
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:22,966
by the time it was ending the last time.

1496
00:57:22,966 --> 00:57:24,840
MATT: It was later afternoon, evening.

1497
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:25,890
LAURA: Was it?

1498
00:57:26,930 --> 00:57:28,330
SAM: Do we want to--
MARISHA: 4:00pm.

1499
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,880
SAM: Do we want to set up a hidey spot

1500
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:34,030
on anywhere in here, or...?
LAURA: Yeah, find a good--

1501
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:35,640
TALIESIN: We should take a walk about

1502
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,210
and look around a little bit more,

1503
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:39,940
and maybe figure out if there's a place that...

1504
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:41,140
SAM: It's all water, right?

1505
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,170
Is there a walkway around the perimeter, or...?

1506
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:48,240
MARISHA: There's an embankment.
TRAVIS: A catwalk. No manmade stuff.

1507
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,450
MATT: The ships are placed on the sides,

1508
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:51,660
and you can see there's the walls of the cavern.

1509
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:55,118
There's a slight element of...

1510
00:57:56,335 --> 00:57:58,035
silt and some sand

1511
00:57:58,035 --> 00:57:59,740
that gives a slight embankment

1512
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:00,910
but it's all gradual,

1513
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:03,040
so it's not like a platform or any sort of a sand bank

1514
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,690
that you can stand on comfortably.

1515
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:07,860
You can get up against the wall

1516
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:10,880
and it'll keep you there, but it's a decline

1517
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,280
and it slips the further out you go immediately.

1518
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:17,068
ASHLEY: We could just hang out on Eden's Horizon.

1519
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:21,120
SAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Yeah, that wasn't too close,

1520
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,220
where we were feeling the pull, right?

1521
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:25,320
Still safe?
MATT: Yeah, it's far enough away.

1522
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:28,630
LAURA: It's not right when you come in, though,

1523
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:32,070
because if Dieter does come in--
LIAM: Comes busting through.

1524
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:34,110
LAURA: I don't want to be on the ship he sees first,

1525
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:35,560
you know what I mean?

1526
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:36,780
MATT: No, it's not immediately right there.

1527
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:38,110
It's a little ways in.
LAURA: Okay.

1528
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:40,520
MATT: It's, like, halfway through the cavern itself.

1529
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,830
TALIESIN: There is also the question is,

1530
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:43,160
if we go into the cavern,

1531
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,660
how are we going to find our way?

1532
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:50,390
LAURA: One of us will have to be taken.

1533
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:51,640
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think we've just got to let it happen.

1534
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:54,220
LAURA: Then we just follow whoever fails.

1535
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:56,923
SAM: Oh, wow.

1536
00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:00,750
That's disturbing.
ASHLEY: But it disappears

1537
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:02,240
when you get close to him.

1538
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,240
LAURA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: So...

1539
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,350
LAURA: Yeah, it just takes you to the chamber, that's all.

1540
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:08,150
TALIESIN: We'll also need to breathe underwater.

1541
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:10,098
TRAVIS: I just re-upped everyone.
TALIESIN: Oh, well.

1542
00:59:10,098 --> 00:59:11,773
TRAVIS: Yeah. But the rope's not a bad idea,

1543
00:59:11,773 --> 00:59:13,920
because some of us can swim a lot faster than the others.

1544
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:16,230
They would get lost.

1545
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:18,140
SAM: Does anyone have a bunch of rope?

1546
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:20,790
MARISHA: Yeah, a few of us do.
TRAVIS: I have 50 feet of rope.

1547
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:22,040
MARISHA: I have 50 feet as well.

1548
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:24,630
SAM: Cool.
TALIESIN: I do not have rope.

1549
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:27,483
ASHLEY: I have rope.

1550
00:59:27,483 --> 00:59:29,409
TALIESIN: Honestly, I'm actually missing a lot of things.

1551
00:59:29,409 --> 00:59:31,510
LAURA: (laughs)
TALIESIN: Man.

1552
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:33,120
SAM: So shall we just feast and sleep,

1553
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,814
or is there more planning that we need to do?

1554
00:59:35,814 --> 00:59:38,439
TRAVIS: (exhales) Sure feels like
there's more we need to do, doesn't it?

1555
00:59:38,439 --> 00:59:40,470
LIAM: Well...
TRAVIS: Really.

1556
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:43,430
LIAM: Everything changes if Dieter does not come.

1557
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:45,947
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
LIAM: Hopefully he does.

1558
00:59:45,947 --> 00:59:46,780
If he does not come,

1559
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:50,200
we are going to enter for more offerings,

1560
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,660
and just throw down, I would imagine.

1561
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:54,937
We also have to survive our sleep.

1562
00:59:54,937 --> 00:59:55,770
TALIESIN: Yes.

1563
00:59:55,770 --> 00:59:58,475
LIAM: And see if we all remember who we are,

1564
00:59:58,475 --> 01:00:01,160
and deal with that if it is a problem.

1565
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,280
LAURA: Yeah.

1566
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:06,150
We should get some more gold dust ready

1567
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:09,260
just in case somebody does need help in the morning.

1568
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:11,460
TRAVIS: We should probably take shifts while we sleep.

1569
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:12,690
If he's been watching us

1570
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:14,350
and we've been traveling all over the island

1571
01:00:14,350 --> 01:00:16,550
and he's clocking us as a threat,

1572
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:19,200
we are pretty close to where he is,

1573
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,700
just on the off-chance that he's like,

1574
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,950
"Oh, I'm going to go get them while they sleep."

1575
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:25,760
TALIESIN: Little thread ought to do that.

1576
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:29,080
Also, we're going to be sleeping in a bubble, right?

1577
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:31,253
LIAM: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Or no? Okay.

1578
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:32,380
LIAM: Yeah.

1579
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:33,630
SAM: Except it's not a bubble, though.

1580
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:34,620
It's a dome, right?

1581
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:36,470
LIAM: Yeah, it does not go all the way around, but...

1582
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:38,050
LAURA: So, he could come up from underneath,

1583
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:39,517
because it is a boat.

1584
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,173
LIAM: Yeah. He would have to go through

1585
01:00:42,173 --> 01:00:46,258
all of our large ship to get to us, but...

1586
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:50,540
And then when the moment happens,

1587
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:55,133
either here in the shipyard, or in Vokodo's lair,

1588
01:00:56,610 --> 01:01:00,140
we will try to send him away, no?

1589
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:03,090
So you all have to keep him busy.

1590
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:05,952
TRAVIS: Yes. We can do that.

1591
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:09,525
MARISHA: As long as I can get up to him.

1592
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:14,730
LAURA: I can-- I have a spell for that.

1593
01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:15,563
MARISHA: Dope.

1594
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:19,160
MATT: For the two clerics,

1595
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,850
how much diamond dust do you still have left?

1596
01:01:20,850 --> 01:01:22,470
LAURA: Is it diamond dust that we need?

1597
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:24,286
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: Or gold dust? Okay, it's diamond dust?

1598
01:01:24,286 --> 01:01:26,800
MATT: Diamond dust for the Greater Restoration.

1599
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:29,209
LAURA: Let me look at my diamonds.

1600
01:01:29,209 --> 01:01:30,800
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, that is the variable.

1601
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:34,340
How many of us fail tonight.

1602
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:35,410
ASHLEY: Yeah. (exhales)

1603
01:01:35,410 --> 01:01:36,400
MATT: Vilya, checking in, says,

1604
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,950
"I only have components for one more casting myself."

1605
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:42,210
LAURA: And it's how much worth?
MATT: 100.

1606
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:43,443
LAURA: 100.

1607
01:01:43,443 --> 01:01:48,010
I have a 300 gold diamond and a 500 gold diamond.

1608
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:50,090
SAM: Ooh. But we have to pulverize?

1609
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:54,640
LAURA: Although I've got 100 gold
left from one of the diamonds

1610
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:55,740
because we didn't do it.

1611
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:57,293
This is retroactive.

1612
01:01:58,853 --> 01:02:00,780
SAM: Do we need to pulverize it somehow, or...?

1613
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:03,550
TALIESIN: Do you have any more diamond as well, or...?

1614
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:07,520
SAM: I don't, but I have a substitute.

1615
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:08,620
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right.

1616
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:11,610
SAM: Yes.
TALIESIN: Residuum.

1617
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:13,453
SAM: Residuum.

1618
01:02:13,453 --> 01:02:17,090
LIAM: I can pulverize a gem in the morning.

1619
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:18,040
MARISHA: I have a jeweler's kit.

1620
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:21,980
I can just take the night to file one down.

1621
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:22,813
TRAVIS: (imitates filing)

1622
01:02:22,813 --> 01:02:25,320
LAURA: If I say we destroyed--
TRAVIS: "I'm fine!"

1623
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:28,040
LAURA: If I say we destroyed one of the diamonds,

1624
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,710
the 300 gold diamond, you cast Greater Restoration

1625
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:33,657
how many times the last time?

1626
01:02:35,713 --> 01:02:36,978
Did you cast it twice?

1627
01:02:36,978 --> 01:02:39,395
LIAM: (sighs)

1628
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:41,990
LAURA: Vilya cast it--
MATT: Vilya cast it once.

1629
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:43,340
TRAVIS: Yeah, she cast it on you.

1630
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:45,500
You cast it on her.
LAURA: I cast it on you.

1631
01:02:46,450 --> 01:02:47,840
MATT: But you also cast it on Vilya,

1632
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,880
so it's four times it's been used.

1633
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:52,715
LAURA: Four times it's been used?
TALIESIN: Four times.

1634
01:02:54,815 --> 01:02:56,760
Going through my stuff.

1635
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:59,960
SAM: Do you have any diamonds?
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah, I do.

1636
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:02,400
I'm just trying to figure out--

1637
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,075
I don't have any powdered diamonds.

1638
01:03:05,075 --> 01:03:06,020
I would've...
LAURA: But we can say

1639
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:07,720
that Caleb would've powdered them.

1640
01:03:11,391 --> 01:03:13,180
MATT: How much residuum do you have?

1641
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:15,635
SAM: I have 700 gold pieces' worth.

1642
01:03:15,635 --> 01:03:16,810
TALIESIN: (whistling)

1643
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:19,550
MATT: So that's seven casts, as long as somebody--

1644
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:21,360
SAM: It totally replaces?

1645
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,080
MATT: Residuum can be used to replace

1646
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:26,740
any sort of material component cost of equal cost,

1647
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:29,070
but only if they have it on their person to use it.

1648
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:32,030
SAM: Well, I will give you all the residuum, then.

1649
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:35,410
I'll give 400 to you, Jester, and 300 to you, Caduceus.

1650
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:38,350
TALIESIN: How much?
SAM: 300.

1651
01:03:38,350 --> 01:03:41,155
TALIESIN: Wow, okay.
SAM: I don't need it.

1652
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:47,670
Just giving away all my shit.
MATT: (laughs)

1653
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:49,870
MARISHA: Maybe you're not such a hoarder after all.

1654
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:54,200
Growth.
MATT: (laughs)

1655
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,800
SAM: I really want it back, though.

1656
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,890
MARISHA: Oh. I don't think that's how it works.

1657
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,220
TALIESIN: Just checking how much it takes to...

1658
01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:07,410
Pop someone back to life if something bad happens.

1659
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:11,190
LAURA: It's 300. It's a 300 gold diamond.

1660
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:14,020
TALIESIN: I've got a 350 diamond.
LAURA: I've got a 300 diamond

1661
01:04:15,417 --> 01:04:18,370
and a 500 gold diamond.
TALIESIN: The 500's the Hail Mary

1662
01:04:18,370 --> 01:04:20,100
if something goes really, really wrong.

1663
01:04:21,570 --> 01:04:23,280
300's a quick fix.

1664
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:26,690
500's a long-term problem.
LAURA: Well, one of them...

1665
01:04:27,959 --> 01:04:29,977
Oh, god.

1666
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:33,400
So I'm going to say we used residuum for the last ones.

1667
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,060
This is so hard to do retroactive.

1668
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:38,260
So I've got 300 gold worth of residuum.

1669
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:42,031
SAM: Do you have the plans for
the American war base as well?

1670
01:04:42,031 --> 01:04:44,975
(laughter)

1671
01:04:44,975 --> 01:04:46,928
TRAVIS: Coca-Cola.

1672
01:04:47,770 --> 01:04:50,330
LIAM: Here's what we're going to do.

1673
01:04:50,330 --> 01:04:51,688
LAURA: And you have--
TRAVIS: John Wayne.

1674
01:04:51,688 --> 01:04:53,880
LAURA: -- 200 gold worth of residuum?

1675
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:56,460
TALIESIN: I cast twice, so I would have 100.

1676
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:58,790
LAURA: Got it, okay.
MATT: All right.

1677
01:04:58,790 --> 01:05:01,720
Well, there you go.
TALIESIN: And 50 diamond

1678
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:02,906
if someone grinds them down.

1679
01:05:02,906 --> 01:05:05,400
SAM: 50 on a gift certificate.
MATT: So, with that said,

1680
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:09,190
you guys can rest for the evening early if you'd like to,

1681
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:12,390
and wake up early after a eight-hour rest,

1682
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:13,670
if that's the case,

1683
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:16,900
if you're looking for maximized time for Water Breathing

1684
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:18,700
and anything else you want to do before bed.

1685
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:21,970
Your call.
MARISHA: Fancy Feast.

1686
01:05:21,970 --> 01:05:25,320
LAURA: Yeah. Set it up on the, uh...

1687
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,770
On the deck of this here ship?

1688
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:30,050
MATT: All right. You guys have situated now

1689
01:05:30,050 --> 01:05:33,540
up on top of the Eden's Horizon,

1690
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:35,450
after getting your materials ready

1691
01:05:35,450 --> 01:05:37,850
for any possible encounters in the day to come.

1692
01:05:38,790 --> 01:05:43,460
Jester, describe how you set your Heroes' Feast out.

1693
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:44,950
LAURA: Oh man, oh man!

1694
01:05:44,950 --> 01:05:47,560
Do we have tables here on this deck, or is it just--?

1695
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:51,500
I'm going to make it just a
really pretty setup with blankets.

1696
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,560
I'm going to use some of my blue fabric

1697
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:57,007
to set up picnic blankets all over the deck, you know?

1698
01:05:57,007 --> 01:05:57,843
MATT: Okay.

1699
01:05:57,843 --> 01:06:01,768
LAURA: And it's going to be like a feast of

1700
01:06:02,768 --> 01:06:05,234
pancakes and...

1701
01:06:07,390 --> 01:06:08,860
Lots of pancakes.

1702
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:13,550
Some candy, some scones.

1703
01:06:15,718 --> 01:06:17,000
A little bit of, what,

1704
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,100
like, potatoes for Caduceus.

1705
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,690
Do you want some mushrooms or something?

1706
01:06:20,690 --> 01:06:23,515
TALIESIN: I can eat pancakes. Pancakes are fine.
LAURA: Great, pancakes.

1707
01:06:23,515 --> 01:06:24,700
So more pancakes!

1708
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:26,328
MARISHA: It's a continental breakfast buffet.

1709
01:06:26,328 --> 01:06:27,820
LAURA: And then-- yeah.

1710
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:30,295
I figure some pocket bacon for Beau.

1711
01:06:30,295 --> 01:06:32,350
TRAVIS: All the carbs.
TALIESIN: Very carby.

1712
01:06:32,350 --> 01:06:35,610
LAURA: Some weird-looking bug sort of things for Yasha,

1713
01:06:35,610 --> 01:06:37,060
just because they're interesting-looking,

1714
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:38,910
but really they taste like chocolate.

1715
01:06:38,910 --> 01:06:41,170
ASHLEY: Oh, yes.
LAURA: Spicy chocolate.

1716
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:43,780
ASHLEY: Oh, very good.
TALIESIN: That's fine.

1717
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:45,210
ASHLEY: It has a little bit of a kick.

1718
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:47,190
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LAURA: And...

1719
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,740
It's really colorful.

1720
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:52,490
You know, unicorn whipped cream sort of stuff.

1721
01:06:54,690 --> 01:06:56,130
TALIESIN: Hook Lost Boys.

1722
01:06:56,130 --> 01:06:58,800
LAURA: Yeah! Very similar to, yeah, Hook.

1723
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,812
But not quite so primary colors.

1724
01:07:00,812 --> 01:07:03,377
They're more pastel sort of shades.
TRAVIS: You're doing it, Peter!

1725
01:07:03,377 --> 01:07:06,150
LAURA: Cakes, cookies...

1726
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:08,160
Do you guys want anything more substantial,

1727
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:10,010
or is this good?
SAM: No, this is good.

1728
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:13,910
LAURA: Give everyone stomach aches before we go in?

1729
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:16,797
TRAVIS: Yep. Give everybody the reenies.
MATT: Yep.

1730
01:07:16,797 --> 01:07:19,690
Possibly type 2 diabetes.
LIAM: One bowl of greens, perhaps.

1731
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:20,523
Just one.

1732
01:07:21,590 --> 01:07:22,423
LAURA: Caleb.

1733
01:07:22,423 --> 01:07:24,164
SAM: Like a cucumber salad. He likes dill, and--

1734
01:07:24,164 --> 01:07:25,281
LIAM: Have to be regular.

1735
01:07:25,281 --> 01:07:27,250
LAURA: God, okay, okay.
TRAVIS: Fiber.

1736
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:31,150
LAURA: There's one teeny, tiny bowl of cucumber salad.

1737
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:33,777
TALIESIN: It's got Jell-O in it. That's weird.

1738
01:07:33,777 --> 01:07:35,053
(laughter)

1739
01:07:35,053 --> 01:07:37,716
LAURA: It's got green sprinkles on the top for sure.

1740
01:07:37,716 --> 01:07:39,149
(laughter)
MATT: All right.

1741
01:07:39,149 --> 01:07:41,250
LIAM: Just green icing.
LAURA: Oh, and some nuts,

1742
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:43,060
because that's what Sprinkle likes to eat.

1743
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:43,893
MATT: There you go.

1744
01:07:45,297 --> 01:07:47,501
LIAM: I thought Sprinkle liked to eat shit.

1745
01:07:47,501 --> 01:07:50,330
TRAVIS: How is Sprinkle?
LAURA: Sprinkle's doing great.

1746
01:07:50,330 --> 01:07:51,780
TALIESIN: Hasn't moved in three days.

1747
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:55,090
MATT: You see from underneath
the shawl that Jester wears,

1748
01:07:55,090 --> 01:07:58,320
this small, skittering weasel head

1749
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:02,550
slowly peers out--
(squeaks and hisses)

1750
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:04,850
And just withdraws back in.
LAURA: He's so good!

1751
01:08:04,850 --> 01:08:07,673
LIAM: Is he a revenant yet?
TRAVIS: "I hope we lose!"

1752
01:08:07,673 --> 01:08:08,790
MATT: You don't know.
MARISHA: He's got to be.

1753
01:08:08,790 --> 01:08:11,170
SAM: When we were at the ruins, I think I saw Sprinkle

1754
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:13,516
trying to get into one of the coffins.

1755
01:08:13,516 --> 01:08:14,980
(laughter)
LAURA: No, he wasn't.

1756
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:16,480
He was not, Veth.

1757
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,327
TRAVIS: "Let Vokodo come!"

1758
01:08:18,327 --> 01:08:19,501
LAURA: He's so comfy!

1759
01:08:19,501 --> 01:08:20,830
Look how comfy my cloak is.

1760
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:23,357
It's so comfy.
TRAVIS: "Offer me up."

1761
01:08:23,357 --> 01:08:24,970
(laughter)

1762
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:27,980
MATT: So, Jester, as you finish your invocation,

1763
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:31,610
you set, amongst this blue sheet

1764
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:32,960
that you've laid out here on the deck--

1765
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:34,426
LAURA: It's green.
MATT: It's gr--?

1766
01:08:34,426 --> 01:08:36,542
Oh, because it's one of the cloaks.

1767
01:08:36,542 --> 01:08:38,330
Oh, there you go, respect.

1768
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:39,163
I misheard.

1769
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:42,710
You place this gemmed chalice onto it,

1770
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:45,974
and as you close your eyes,
having taken everyone's orders...

1771
01:08:45,974 --> 01:08:48,630
(laughter)

1772
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:51,790
You begin to place your hands down on the sides of it

1773
01:08:51,790 --> 01:08:53,180
and lift the fingers up,

1774
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:56,010
and as you do, you watch the chalice seems to fill.

1775
01:08:56,010 --> 01:08:59,360
As it fills with this reddish, orange liquid,

1776
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:01,790
that at first is a little worrying to all of you.

1777
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:05,473
As it spills over, it actually forms

1778
01:09:05,473 --> 01:09:07,889
a red tablecloth

1779
01:09:07,889 --> 01:09:09,820
around the sides of it,

1780
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:11,940
so overtaking the green you put down there.

1781
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:13,560
LAURA: But I still want it to be on the ground.

1782
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:15,500
This is a cute picnic.
MATT: Yes, it's on the ground.

1783
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,890
It's on the ground.
LAURA: Very Mad Hatter.

1784
01:09:17,890 --> 01:09:19,570
Like, everybody gets their own teacup.

1785
01:09:19,570 --> 01:09:21,300
MATT: Yes.
TALIESIN: I'm into it.

1786
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:24,570
MATT: As it spreads out, you
watch as from within this cloth--

1787
01:09:24,570 --> 01:09:27,010
which almost, it looks like a velvet,

1788
01:09:27,010 --> 01:09:28,730
but as you get close to it,

1789
01:09:28,730 --> 01:09:29,900
it's reflecting what's above it.

1790
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:32,690
It's almost like a still surface of water,

1791
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:35,930
and suddenly the water begins to become disturbed,

1792
01:09:35,930 --> 01:09:38,530
and you see from within shapes begin to emerge,

1793
01:09:38,530 --> 01:09:40,570
and as they do, platters begin to arise.

1794
01:09:40,570 --> 01:09:43,120
Poof, poof. Bowls, plates.

1795
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:46,060
A veritable smorgasbord of pancakes,

1796
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:49,520
of real cakes, of sweets, candies,

1797
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:52,840
a bowl of nuts, a salad...
(laughter)

1798
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:54,270
A unique spread.

1799
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:56,820
And as they begin to emerge, the coloration of the red

1800
01:09:56,820 --> 01:09:59,080
begins to shift and give way,

1801
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:01,370
like the color itself is what's giving life

1802
01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:04,510
to each of these small bowls and large spreads,

1803
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:05,660
and as it does, it's left behind

1804
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:07,750
with a weird translucent green color

1805
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:10,510
that mingles with the sheet beneath it.

1806
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:12,540
It looks delicious, it smells delicious,

1807
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:15,620
and everything seems to have this faintly glowing hue to it

1808
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:17,520
that's slightly off-putting,

1809
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,460
but still, the other senses tell you this is an invitation.

1810
01:10:22,570 --> 01:10:24,190
SAM: Is there enough for Vilya as well?

1811
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:25,810
LAURA: Oh, yeah, everybody gets some.

1812
01:10:25,810 --> 01:10:27,610
Sprinkle gets some. Everybody gets some.

1813
01:10:27,610 --> 01:10:30,101
MATT: "I'm not going to lie, it's been
a very long time since I've had a pancake.

1814
01:10:30,101 --> 01:10:32,170
"I'm very excited for this."

1815
01:10:32,170 --> 01:10:33,220
TRAVIS: Pancake!
LAURA: (laughs)

1816
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:36,760
MATT: You all dig into this veritable Heroes' Feast.

1817
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:39,690
It is delicious, it is invigorating,

1818
01:10:39,690 --> 01:10:41,870
and for the next 24 hours...?
LAURA: Yes.

1819
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:44,500
MATT: You have advantage on wisdom saving throws,

1820
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:49,060
you are immune to poison and everyone gains--

1821
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:50,860
is it 2d10 temporary hit points?
LAURA: Yeah.

1822
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:53,034
MATT: Go ahead and roll that now,
Jester, if you don't mind.

1823
01:10:53,034 --> 01:10:54,967
TRAVIS: 2d10 temporary hit points?
MATT: Yes.

1824
01:10:54,967 --> 01:10:55,992
SAM: She's rolling for us, or we roll--?

1825
01:10:55,992 --> 01:10:58,189
MATT: She rolls, and then everybody gets the same number.

1826
01:10:58,189 --> 01:11:01,100
LAURA: (drumming fingers) Okay.

1827
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:03,160
LIAM: I might crack 80.
MARISHA: Yeah, dude.

1828
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:05,743
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!

1829
01:11:07,142 --> 01:11:08,460
(disappointed) Oh.

1830
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:09,843
Nine extra points.

1831
01:11:09,843 --> 01:11:11,218
SAM: Okay.
TRAVIS: Thank you.

1832
01:11:11,218 --> 01:11:13,272
That's half Caleb's HP.

1833
01:11:13,272 --> 01:11:17,680
(laughter)

1834
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:18,830
TALIESIN: Wisdom saving throws.

1835
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:22,340
MATT: With a comfortable meal in your belly

1836
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:25,200
and the surge of divine energy flowing through you,

1837
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:28,800
protecting you, you get the after-meal sleepies.

1838
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,570
LAURA: You also can't be frightened.

1839
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:32,390
MATT: Yeah, sorry, also immune to fear. Useful.

1840
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:34,660
MARISHA: So, wait, it's immune to fear, poison...

1841
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:37,460
TRAVIS: Nine temporary hit points.
MARISHA: And advantage on...

1842
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:38,730
LAURA: Wisdom saving throws.
MARISHA: Wisdom saves.

1843
01:11:38,730 --> 01:11:40,440
MATT: You've got it.
MARISHA: Clutch.

1844
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:43,560
MATT: Yeah, Heroes' Feast is legit.
MARISHA: While we eat...

1845
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:45,390
Hang on.
MATT: Mm-hmm?

1846
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:46,773
MARISHA: Hang on.

1847
01:11:46,773 --> 01:11:51,756
Advantage Wis saves.

1848
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:54,563
Jester?
LAURA: Hm?

1849
01:11:54,563 --> 01:11:56,080
MARISHA: How are you feeling about Traveler Con?

1850
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:00,150
You know, if we defeat the looming volcano god

1851
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:02,820
that has this entire island held hostage.

1852
01:12:06,083 --> 01:12:07,943
LAURA: Um. (sighs)

1853
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:10,316
MARISHA: You all right?

1854
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:14,910
I honestly thought that that was going to be, like,

1855
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:17,250
something that you'd start rattling off

1856
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:19,760
a thousand ideas about, but you didn't say anything.

1857
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:21,700
So now I'm super-concerned.

1858
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:23,780
LAURA: I just don't, um...

1859
01:12:23,780 --> 01:12:25,021
I don't...

1860
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:27,930
know...

1861
01:12:32,770 --> 01:12:36,585
I don't know what to do about it.

1862
01:12:37,790 --> 01:12:40,200
SAM: Like, whether or not to have it?

1863
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:44,240
Or what to do when you do have it?

1864
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:47,703
LAURA: Well.

1865
01:12:54,290 --> 01:12:56,423
Obviously, we're going to have it.

1866
01:12:58,110 --> 01:12:59,151
But...

1867
01:13:02,009 --> 01:13:03,351
the Traveler...

1868
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:07,015
He doesn't want to be a god.

1869
01:13:07,986 --> 01:13:08,969
He doesn't...

1870
01:13:11,166 --> 01:13:12,374
He doesn't like it.

1871
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:16,450
So I don't, um...

1872
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:19,050
I don't know...

1873
01:13:23,150 --> 01:13:25,100
how to make everybody come here

1874
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:27,380
and pretend like they're going to worship him...

1875
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:34,320
and also make him happy and also make sure

1876
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:37,610
that they're not taken advantage of too much,

1877
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:40,045
and also free everybody here.

1878
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:46,450
And also, at the end of it,

1879
01:13:46,450 --> 01:13:48,375
if he doesn't want to be a god,

1880
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:54,210
what does that mean for me and him?

1881
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:55,043
Or...

1882
01:13:58,390 --> 01:13:59,602
I don't know. (sighs)

1883
01:13:59,602 --> 01:14:01,620
I don't know.

1884
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:04,310
I was hoping maybe we will fight Vokodo

1885
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:06,618
and then everything will just become clear.

1886
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:13,630
MARISHA: You seemed sad last night after you went off

1887
01:14:13,630 --> 01:14:15,060
and talked to him for a bit.
LIAM: You're sad now.

1888
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:17,110
LAURA: I am not sad now.

1889
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:18,950
I'm just, you know.
MARISHA: Oh.

1890
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:21,910
Those are tears.
LAURA: No, I'm just, like...

1891
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:24,827
You know, it's just-- it's stressful.

1892
01:14:28,190 --> 01:14:32,378
LIAM: What if it were just you and him, like your old days?

1893
01:14:33,790 --> 01:14:35,540
LAURA: I don't think that's a bad thing.

1894
01:14:37,790 --> 01:14:39,281
You know? He--

1895
01:14:42,899 --> 01:14:44,961
He was really wonderful then.

1896
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,178
He was my best friend.

1897
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:52,930
I know all of you are concerned

1898
01:14:52,930 --> 01:14:56,170
that maybe he's taking advantage

1899
01:14:56,170 --> 01:14:59,650
or he doesn't have our best interests.

1900
01:14:59,650 --> 01:15:01,780
Which who knows, maybe he doesn't.

1901
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:06,171
But, he really...

1902
01:15:06,171 --> 01:15:09,213
got me through a lot when I was younger, you know?

1903
01:15:11,190 --> 01:15:13,527
And he was all I had, really, and...

1904
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:17,582
He was wonderful.

1905
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:21,887
He taught me so much.

1906
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:27,560
If it just was him being my friend again,

1907
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,418
I'd be okay with that.

1908
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:34,890
I just don't know what that means for everyone else,

1909
01:15:34,890 --> 01:15:37,248
you know, all the people that are coming here.

1910
01:15:38,630 --> 01:15:41,530
TRAVIS: If he said he doesn't want to be a god,

1911
01:15:41,530 --> 01:15:44,400
did he say why he's still having everyone come here?

1912
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:46,307
MARISHA: Did he know about this place?

1913
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:49,340
LAURA: He did.

1914
01:15:51,610 --> 01:15:53,410
That was, um...

1915
01:15:53,410 --> 01:15:55,048
kind of sad to find out about.

1916
01:15:55,048 --> 01:15:56,731
He-- he knew that...

1917
01:15:58,197 --> 01:16:00,755
people lost their memory here, apparently.

1918
01:16:02,073 --> 01:16:04,210
(sniffs)

1919
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:08,593
Um. I think, you know...

1920
01:16:12,450 --> 01:16:13,650
I think he's hoping

1921
01:16:13,650 --> 01:16:17,357
to sort of offload a lot of the people when they come.

1922
01:16:17,357 --> 01:16:20,515
Maybe-- not necessarily leave them here,

1923
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,750
but make them think that, you know,

1924
01:16:25,110 --> 01:16:27,193
he's not so available any more.

1925
01:16:29,087 --> 01:16:30,795
It would be really stressful, you know,

1926
01:16:30,795 --> 01:16:33,487
to have all these people constantly praying to you.

1927
01:16:34,570 --> 01:16:36,087
TRAVIS: But he sent you here.

1928
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:40,710
LAURA: Yeah.

1929
01:16:40,710 --> 01:16:42,642
TRAVIS: What if you forgot him?

1930
01:16:43,910 --> 01:16:47,458
LAURA: He promised me that he would save me.

1931
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:51,603
And us. He said all of us.

1932
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:53,638
I believe him.

1933
01:16:56,760 --> 01:17:00,907
ASHLEY: How do you feel about him right now,

1934
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:04,077
knowing this, that he...

1935
01:17:07,650 --> 01:17:11,200
I am very not trying to overstep at all,

1936
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:14,610
but him knowing that he would bring people here,

1937
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:18,093
that it's possible that they would forget?

1938
01:17:20,650 --> 01:17:22,326
LAURA: (sighs shakily)

1939
01:17:23,493 --> 01:17:26,743
(soft, ethereal music)

1940
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:32,095
LAURA: He's not, like, the best guy. (laughs)

1941
01:17:32,095 --> 01:17:34,070
You know, he's really cool.

1942
01:17:34,070 --> 01:17:37,920
But I don't think he always, you know...

1943
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:45,450
Thinks about other people,

1944
01:17:45,450 --> 01:17:49,190
about how they'll actually be affected, sometimes.

1945
01:17:49,190 --> 01:17:50,973
And that's just, you know,

1946
01:17:50,973 --> 01:17:55,398
just because he's, you know,
super super powerful, and um...

1947
01:17:56,383 --> 01:17:57,216
to us...

1948
01:17:58,249 --> 01:18:00,340
and to him, we're like ants sometimes.

1949
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:03,720
We don't think about the fact when we squish an ant.

1950
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:05,810
It doesn't mean anything to us,

1951
01:18:05,810 --> 01:18:08,297
but the ant is real sad.

1952
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:11,032
TRAVIS: Or it's dead.

1953
01:18:13,710 --> 01:18:14,543
LAURA: Or dead.

1954
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:24,432
TRAVIS: Jester, we all want what's best for you, of course.

1955
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:26,970
Have you talked to him at all

1956
01:18:26,970 --> 01:18:29,070
about going back to just the way things were

1957
01:18:29,070 --> 01:18:31,720
when you were little, just he and you, as friends?

1958
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:33,736
LAURA: I want to. I want to, I want to.

1959
01:18:33,736 --> 01:18:35,750
It's just every time we talk

1960
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:37,900
he has to disappear so fast.

1961
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:40,907
Before, he used to be here all the time, you know?

1962
01:18:42,055 --> 01:18:45,710
Ugh, it's so hard to share. (laughs)

1963
01:18:45,710 --> 01:18:47,690
SAM: But you know where he'll be.

1964
01:18:47,690 --> 01:18:49,920
He'll be at Traveler Con.
LAURA: (sniffs) I know.

1965
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:50,980
He is going to be here.

1966
01:18:50,980 --> 01:18:54,234
SAM: And the thing that you guys have all taught me

1967
01:18:54,234 --> 01:18:58,010
is that friends call each other on their shit,

1968
01:18:58,010 --> 01:18:59,350
and if they're really friends,

1969
01:18:59,350 --> 01:19:01,720
then they'll be friends afterwards.

1970
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:02,920
And if you know where he'll be,

1971
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:04,820
and you know he's not going to disappear,

1972
01:19:05,966 --> 01:19:07,883
you should call him on his shit.

1973
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:12,590
Traveler Con shouldn't be about bamboozling people

1974
01:19:12,590 --> 01:19:14,830
or you trying to put on a show.

1975
01:19:14,830 --> 01:19:17,590
Traveler Con should be about you and the Traveler.

1976
01:19:18,710 --> 01:19:20,277
That's how it all started.

1977
01:19:22,370 --> 01:19:25,030
LAURA: But all those people are already on their way here.

1978
01:19:25,030 --> 01:19:26,622
SAM: We'll deal with them after.

1979
01:19:29,830 --> 01:19:31,500
TRAVIS: You've done so much for him,

1980
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,100
and I know he's done so much for you,

1981
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:35,910
but trying to make him happy in this,

1982
01:19:37,990 --> 01:19:39,400
it puts you at risk.

1983
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:42,650
It has put you at risk, and us.

1984
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:46,070
That doesn't seem, like you said,

1985
01:19:46,070 --> 01:19:47,430
the most considerate thing.

1986
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:52,840
LIAM: Yeah, but also, it is complicated sometimes,

1987
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:54,750
extracting yourself from the very things

1988
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:58,210
that made you who you are.
LAURA: (sniffs)

1989
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:00,168
So this might be difficult.

1990
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:04,566
MARISHA: We're protective of you,

1991
01:20:04,566 --> 01:20:07,630
and defensive of you.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1992
01:20:07,630 --> 01:20:11,856
MARISHA: We're here because of Jester,
not because of the Traveler Con.

1993
01:20:11,856 --> 01:20:14,790
(soft, pensive music)

1994
01:20:14,790 --> 01:20:16,565
Honestly...

1995
01:20:18,873 --> 01:20:20,864
all you have to do is say the word,

1996
01:20:22,361 --> 01:20:24,420
and we'll do whatever you want.

1997
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:26,345
It's always been the case.

1998
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:29,415
But...

1999
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:35,650
Also, if he hurts you, I'll kill him.

2000
01:20:35,650 --> 01:20:37,138
You know? Like...

2001
01:20:37,138 --> 01:20:38,830
we've killed demigods before.

2002
01:20:38,830 --> 01:20:41,227
We're about to kill one.
We could kill him, too.

2003
01:20:41,227 --> 01:20:42,738
LAURA: We don't-- I don't want to kill him.

2004
01:20:42,738 --> 01:20:44,120
MARISHA: Yeah, but, you know, we could.

2005
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:48,895
And we would if you said the word.

2006
01:20:51,350 --> 01:20:53,075
LAURA: Thank you, Beau.

2007
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:55,855
I don't want to kill him.

2008
01:20:57,610 --> 01:21:00,277
MARISHA: Just don't want to see you being used, either.

2009
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:04,330
LAURA: Yeah.

2010
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:10,738
I don't want to be used.

2011
01:21:15,430 --> 01:21:16,880
MARISHA: You know, you're kind of...

2012
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:22,487
to echo Nott's point, you are like his peer now.

2013
01:21:22,487 --> 01:21:23,860
LAURA: (laughing) No, I'm not.

2014
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:26,270
He can do so many things.

2015
01:21:26,270 --> 01:21:28,450
He can bamf in and out whenever he wants to!

2016
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:29,833
SAM: So can you.

2017
01:21:29,833 --> 01:21:32,150
LAURA: I can't. I'm stuck here on this island.

2018
01:21:32,990 --> 01:21:35,465
SAM: You can turn into things and fly, and you can...

2019
01:21:36,713 --> 01:21:37,870
You've got a lot of powers.

2020
01:21:37,870 --> 01:21:40,450
Look, you made us this amazing dinner out of nothing.

2021
01:21:40,450 --> 01:21:42,266
LAURA: This is a really good dinner.
SAM: Yeah!

2022
01:21:42,266 --> 01:21:43,450
TRAVIS: Quite good.
ASHLEY: It's a very good dinner.

2023
01:21:43,450 --> 01:21:44,980
I've never had pancakes before,

2024
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:47,230
and this might be my favorite thing I've ever had.

2025
01:21:47,230 --> 01:21:49,540
TRAVIS: You really haven't touched your bugs much.

2026
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:51,462
ASHLEY: Because I'm eating all the pancakes.

2027
01:21:51,462 --> 01:21:53,837
TRAVIS: They're crawling, though, away.
SAM: You could roll them up.

2028
01:21:53,837 --> 01:21:55,920
TALIESIN: I was about to say, if you roll them up, and...

2029
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:59,960
ASHLEY: Best bug I've ever had.
(laughter)

2030
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:01,320
MARISHA: I guess we're a little bit biased

2031
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:05,760
because we've seen you do a lot more amazing things

2032
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:08,118
than we've seen the Traveler do.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2033
01:22:08,118 --> 01:22:11,385
LAURA: Everything I do, all of it,

2034
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:13,822
is because of him.

2035
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:17,727
MARISHA: Ah, give yourself some credit, too, though.

2036
01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:23,890
TRAVIS: And you care about people you know,

2037
01:22:23,890 --> 01:22:25,473
about people you don't know.

2038
01:22:26,505 --> 01:22:27,700
You cause chaos, but in the end,

2039
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:29,200
you don't want to hurt people.

2040
01:22:31,161 --> 01:22:32,710
You care.

2041
01:22:32,710 --> 01:22:34,210
In many ways, you're much more

2042
01:22:34,210 --> 01:22:37,320
than he will probably ever be.

2043
01:22:39,670 --> 01:22:43,430
MARISHA: It's super natural for
students to outgrow their teachers.

2044
01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:45,548
I mean, look at me with Dairon.

2045
01:22:46,951 --> 01:22:48,090
TRAVIS: (stammering)

2046
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:50,220
MARISHA: You know?
LAURA: Yeah.

2047
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:53,610
MARISHA: Who's the teacher now?
LAURA: (laughs)

2048
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:58,079
Yeah. You're way cooler.

2049
01:22:58,079 --> 01:22:59,761
MARISHA: I-I-I know.

2050
01:22:59,761 --> 01:23:03,080
And you're way cooler than the Traveler, in my opinion.

2051
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:05,201
SAM: Did we leave Dairon at our house, by the way?

2052
01:23:05,201 --> 01:23:07,230
TRAVIS: (laughs)
SAM: Is she there for forever?

2053
01:23:07,230 --> 01:23:08,490
No.
MARISHA: No, they're back in--

2054
01:23:08,490 --> 01:23:12,070
SAM: Oh, okay.
MARISHA: -- in Zadash now, I think.

2055
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:13,610
Or are they still in Rexx--?

2056
01:23:13,610 --> 01:23:16,040
I don't know.
SAM: Cool, cool, cool.

2057
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:16,873
MARISHA: She's around.

2058
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:23,780
ASHLEY: Jester, I hope you know how special you are.

2059
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:28,315
Just you, even without the Traveler.

2060
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:36,995
We all think you're pretty amazing.

2061
01:23:41,365 --> 01:23:44,073
LIAM: And so does he, to a certain extent, so perhaps...

2062
01:23:45,298 --> 01:23:47,981
a little more time with you

2063
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:51,263
will color his perspective instead of he coloring yours.

2064
01:23:54,690 --> 01:23:55,923
LAURA: Thank you, guys.

2065
01:23:57,940 --> 01:23:58,940
TRAVIS: Yeah. If you ever want it,

2066
01:23:58,940 --> 01:24:00,640
there is life beyond the Traveler.

2067
01:24:01,530 --> 01:24:02,621
We're here.

2068
01:24:06,023 --> 01:24:07,254
LAURA: Wow.

2069
01:24:08,787 --> 01:24:12,731
That's pretty great. Thanks! (laughs)

2070
01:24:12,731 --> 01:24:14,652
Not going to lie, I feel pretty good right now.

2071
01:24:14,652 --> 01:24:16,233
(laughter)

2072
01:24:16,233 --> 01:24:17,341
TRAVIS: It's the pancakes.

2073
01:24:17,341 --> 01:24:19,470
TALIESIN: I just want to say, you all just did so well.

2074
01:24:19,470 --> 01:24:21,483
I'm so proud.
(laughter)

2075
01:24:21,483 --> 01:24:23,250
MARISHA: Oh, thanks, yeah.
TALIESIN: Everybody was just--

2076
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:24,933
SAM: We pulled a Caduceus!
MARISHA: Yeah, we did!

2077
01:24:24,933 --> 01:24:26,683
TALIESIN: You guys...
I just got to sit here and nod.

2078
01:24:26,683 --> 01:24:28,070
It was amazing.
SAM: Wow!

2079
01:24:28,070 --> 01:24:31,510
TALIESIN: Wisdom, wisdom, self-realization.

2080
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:33,988
A little more wisdom, some more self-realization.

2081
01:24:33,988 --> 01:24:35,888
(laughter)
It was great.

2082
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:40,060
MATT: Vilya, mouth still half-full with a pancake, goes,

2083
01:24:41,312 --> 01:24:42,610
"I know I've only just met you,

2084
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:45,013
"but this is a tight family.

2085
01:24:46,830 --> 01:24:48,320
"Hold onto each other.

2086
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:50,310
"This is important."

2087
01:24:50,310 --> 01:24:52,835
LIAM: I gently push my salad across towards Vilya.

2088
01:24:54,230 --> 01:24:55,942
MATT: She eats more of her pancakes.

2089
01:24:55,942 --> 01:24:57,737
(laughter)

2090
01:24:57,737 --> 01:24:59,787
"I've had plenty of salad in recent years."

2091
01:25:00,870 --> 01:25:03,760
LAURA: Have you ever had salad with sprinkles, though?

2092
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:05,530
MATT: "There's sprinkles in that?

2093
01:25:05,530 --> 01:25:08,420
"That's strange.
(laughter)

2094
01:25:08,420 --> 01:25:10,213
"That's unique."

2095
01:25:11,310 --> 01:25:13,962
TALIESIN: Basically sugared croutons
when you get down to it.

2096
01:25:13,962 --> 01:25:17,074
LAURA: Ugh.
MARISHA: Disneyland resort salad.

2097
01:25:17,074 --> 01:25:19,760
TALIESIN: (laughs)

2098
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:21,020
TRAVIS: Frosted Flakes in your salad.

2099
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:23,419
MARISHA: Why are they shaped
like Mickey ears, these cucumbers?

2100
01:25:23,419 --> 01:25:24,443
(laughter)

2101
01:25:24,443 --> 01:25:26,547
TRAVIS: Frosted Mini Wheats.

2102
01:25:26,547 --> 01:25:28,145
TALIESIN: How do you get an avocado to do that, even.

2103
01:25:28,145 --> 01:25:30,495
MARISHA: (laughs)

2104
01:25:30,495 --> 01:25:33,000
MATT: Well, the evening is yours to set up as you see fit,

2105
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,620
whether it be more things to get ready,

2106
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:36,840
more conversations to have or setting up the dome

2107
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:38,210
and whatever your preparation would be

2108
01:25:38,210 --> 01:25:39,960
before a night's rest.

2109
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:41,960
LIAM: Yeah, I think I would set up the dome,

2110
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:45,170
not on the deck, but...
MATT: Below deck?

2111
01:25:45,170 --> 01:25:46,340
LIAM: Below deck.

2112
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:48,748
And I will set up, uh...

2113
01:25:49,961 --> 01:25:51,627
I won't set up the wire. There's no point to it.

2114
01:25:51,627 --> 01:25:53,830
But what I will do is, eventually,

2115
01:25:53,830 --> 01:25:55,820
whether this is in sequence now or later,

2116
01:25:55,820 --> 01:25:59,510
I'm going to take time to pull out the wand

2117
01:25:59,510 --> 01:26:01,310
that Calianna gifted to me

2118
01:26:01,310 --> 01:26:05,520
and set it down inside the dome and take out...

2119
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:09,590
I have a handful of little bits of stained glass

2120
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:13,680
from our battle with the Laughing Hand.

2121
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:15,710
I'm just going to lay the wand down on the ground

2122
01:26:15,710 --> 01:26:19,030
and spend, I don't know, maybe 30 minutes to an hour

2123
01:26:19,030 --> 01:26:22,968
just sort of sliding different pieces of glass around,

2124
01:26:23,930 --> 01:26:28,930
switching them out, and just pondering a thing.

2125
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:30,330
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: That's it.

2126
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:34,040
MATT: Anybody else need to do anything?

2127
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:36,930
LAURA: Um.
TALIESIN: I'm just going to sit.

2128
01:26:36,930 --> 01:26:41,773
Meditate. Listen to the sound of the waterfall.

2129
01:26:41,773 --> 01:26:43,510
MATT: All right.

2130
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:45,830
LAURA: Yes, I am going to do something.

2131
01:26:45,830 --> 01:26:47,690
MATT: What you doing, Jester?

2132
01:26:47,690 --> 01:26:50,990
LAURA: I'm going to go up to the front of the cavern

2133
01:26:50,990 --> 01:26:53,520
where the waterfall is.
MATT: Okay.

2134
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:56,280
LAURA: Is there an object like a rock

2135
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:58,946
or anything nearby the front of that cavern?

2136
01:26:58,946 --> 01:27:00,413
Anything that I can...

2137
01:27:00,413 --> 01:27:02,792
like, is there a boat that's close by?

2138
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:07,080
MATT: There is a ship maybe about, begins

2139
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:09,060
at 20 or so feet from the entranceway

2140
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:10,640
on the left side.

2141
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:12,260
If you're looking for a small rock,

2142
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:13,918
like a handheld rock?
LAURA: Uh-huh.

2143
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:16,700
That would have a place to position

2144
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:19,230
right near the cavern.
MATT: Okay, okay.

2145
01:27:20,550 --> 01:27:21,940
Make an investigation check

2146
01:27:21,940 --> 01:27:26,530
as you're rummaging through the nearby sand and dirt

2147
01:27:26,530 --> 01:27:27,870
that has accumulated at the corner

2148
01:27:27,870 --> 01:27:30,710
to see if there's any loose stone or rock that you can grab.

2149
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:32,610
LAURA: 11.
MATT: 11?

2150
01:27:32,610 --> 01:27:33,650
Eh, it takes you a little bit,

2151
01:27:33,650 --> 01:27:38,008
but you manage to find a piece of flaked-off obsidian

2152
01:27:38,008 --> 01:27:41,458
from the inside of the rock cavern,

2153
01:27:43,237 --> 01:27:45,320
or the volcanic rock, goes into an obsidian color.

2154
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:46,153
But you pull it out.

2155
01:27:46,153 --> 01:27:49,340
It's sharp on one edge, about that big, but you find one.

2156
01:27:49,340 --> 01:27:50,790
LAURA: Do I still have Tongues up?

2157
01:27:52,650 --> 01:27:54,110
MATT: Tongues lasts an hour, I believe?

2158
01:27:54,110 --> 01:27:55,613
LAURA: It was only an hour?

2159
01:27:55,613 --> 01:27:58,603
LIAM: (murmuring)

2160
01:27:58,603 --> 01:28:00,534
(tutting)

2161
01:28:00,534 --> 01:28:01,470
That is correct, one hour.

2162
01:28:01,470 --> 01:28:03,010
MATT: So, no, that would be gone.
LAURA: Okay.

2163
01:28:09,870 --> 01:28:12,170
Well, hopefully he'll recognize my voice.

2164
01:28:12,170 --> 01:28:17,170
I'm going to cast, with my Rod of the Solitary Scout,

2165
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:18,970
the wand that I have,

2166
01:28:18,970 --> 01:28:20,750
I'm going to cast Magic Mouth.

2167
01:28:20,750 --> 01:28:22,860
SAM: Ooh!
MATT: Okay.

2168
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:24,620
LAURA: On the rock.
MATT: Okay.

2169
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:27,423
LAURA: And I'm going to say...

2170
01:28:31,510 --> 01:28:35,534
Here they are, ready for the taking!

2171
01:28:35,534 --> 01:28:36,715
TRAVIS: (laughs)

2172
01:28:36,715 --> 01:28:38,290
LAURA: And then I put it right at the edge,

2173
01:28:38,290 --> 01:28:41,480
so that way, if the dragon turtle comes within range,

2174
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:44,083
he'll hear it and be tempted to come on in.

2175
01:28:44,083 --> 01:28:45,890
TRAVIS: (laughs)
MATT: Okay. All right.

2176
01:28:45,890 --> 01:28:48,520
As you seal that vocal print into the stone,

2177
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:50,130
it vibrates in your hand

2178
01:28:50,130 --> 01:28:51,930
and you place it just in the proximity

2179
01:28:51,930 --> 01:28:53,080
of where the illusion begins

2180
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:55,500
and the actual opening for the cavern itself is held.

2181
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:56,333
You feel pretty confident

2182
01:28:56,333 --> 01:28:58,120
that a being of that size, if it were to come through,

2183
01:28:58,120 --> 01:28:59,710
would definitely trigger the radius for the spell.

2184
01:28:59,710 --> 01:29:01,493
LAURA: Cool, cool, cool, cool.

2185
01:29:01,493 --> 01:29:03,376
MATT: All right? Anybody else?

2186
01:29:04,336 --> 01:29:06,010
LIAM: A minor thing, I will also stay up

2187
01:29:06,010 --> 01:29:07,300
at least an hour to

2188
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:11,990
use components necessary to turn Frumpkin into an octopus,

2189
01:29:11,990 --> 01:29:14,280
and I will just frisbee him out

2190
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:17,750
off of the ship to patrol
while we are sleeping,

2191
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:20,290
and to be more use, possibly, tomorrow.

2192
01:29:20,290 --> 01:29:22,890
MATT: You got it.
TRAVIS: (imitating octopus)

2193
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:24,930
Perfect. All right.

2194
01:29:24,930 --> 01:29:27,340
Anybody else, or are we looking to a night's rest?

2195
01:29:27,340 --> 01:29:29,312
TRAVIS: Oh my god, I think we're doing it.
SAM: Rest.

2196
01:29:29,312 --> 01:29:30,562
LAURA: (groaning)
MATT: Okay.

2197
01:29:32,410 --> 01:29:33,870
You all gather into the dome.

2198
01:29:33,870 --> 01:29:35,710
Are you doing your jade thing again,

2199
01:29:35,710 --> 01:29:37,315
or leaving it as it was?

2200
01:29:40,123 --> 01:29:41,431
LIAM: I cannot. I'm tapped.

2201
01:29:41,431 --> 01:29:45,120
ASHLEY: Are we tying each other
together or is that a bad idea?

2202
01:29:46,310 --> 01:29:48,043
TALIESIN: We can, uh...
LAURA: Let's do it.

2203
01:29:48,043 --> 01:29:49,350
ASHLEY: Yeah?

2204
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:50,183
TALIESIN: Just in case?

2205
01:29:50,183 --> 01:29:51,499
MATT: So the jade thing,

2206
01:29:51,499 --> 01:29:54,700
the plethora of images that you left the night before,

2207
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:57,390
did help lower the DC of the check last time.

2208
01:29:57,390 --> 01:29:58,330
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: But if you cannot do it,

2209
01:29:58,330 --> 01:30:00,270
then we'll just go with whatever its standard is.

2210
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:02,920
No worries.
LIAM: I am tapped at that level.

2211
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:05,030
MATT: That's okay. All right, then.

2212
01:30:05,030 --> 01:30:07,150
All of you gather for the evening's rest.

2213
01:30:07,150 --> 01:30:09,400
You're tying yourselves together with rope?

2214
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:10,780
TRAVIS: I think we should, right?

2215
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:11,830
TALIESIN: Sure.
LAURA: Yeah.

2216
01:30:11,830 --> 01:30:12,930
MATT: Who's affixed to who?

2217
01:30:12,930 --> 01:30:14,840
Or is it everyone affixed to a singular piece of rope?

2218
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:17,520
TALIESIN: No, we could--
LAURA: Yeah, just do this order.

2219
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:20,070
TRAVIS: We do the twice around your wrist,

2220
01:30:20,070 --> 01:30:24,048
extend it six feet or more.
LAURA: (laughs)

2221
01:30:24,048 --> 01:30:27,150
ASHLEY: We can take it off easily, but it'll wake us up.

2222
01:30:27,150 --> 01:30:29,640
MATT: So it'll take, between all of you,

2223
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:31,780
two sets of rope, I think.
MARISHA: Okay.

2224
01:30:31,780 --> 01:30:32,977
MATT: So you guys got that?
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

2225
01:30:32,977 --> 01:30:34,600
ASHLEY: Yes, I have some.
MATT: Cool.

2226
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:39,040
Placed, roped and resting,

2227
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:41,530
you all eventually find yourselves to a night's sleep.

2228
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:46,380
The dreams range from nothing,

2229
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:49,450
but just an evening of dark comfort,

2230
01:30:49,450 --> 01:30:53,920
to images of past experiences, fuzzy.

2231
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:57,753
Yasha.

2232
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:01,992
In the darkness,

2233
01:31:03,820 --> 01:31:05,350
you still sense yourself sleeping,

2234
01:31:05,350 --> 01:31:07,290
and consciously, you're like,

2235
01:31:07,290 --> 01:31:08,990
"I'm having a hard time sleeping."

2236
01:31:08,990 --> 01:31:10,260
The insomnia's kicked in,

2237
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:13,047
whether it be the nerves for the day before.

2238
01:31:13,047 --> 01:31:14,590
(sighs) Should probably get up.

2239
01:31:14,590 --> 01:31:15,940
And as you open your eyes,

2240
01:31:15,940 --> 01:31:18,937
it's just darkness before you.

2241
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:23,930
Glancing ahead, trying to find something,

2242
01:31:23,930 --> 01:31:25,630
you catch one little speck of light.

2243
01:31:26,505 --> 01:31:29,680
(blowing softly)

2244
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:32,310
A single white feather that seems to be drifting down.

2245
01:31:32,310 --> 01:31:33,330
You're not laying on your side.

2246
01:31:33,330 --> 01:31:35,720
You're sitting up, or at least it's drifting from an angle,

2247
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:38,380
but it's coming straight down from your perspective,

2248
01:31:38,380 --> 01:31:39,500
before it comes to rest on the ground.

2249
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:41,550
As it hits,
(popping)

2250
01:31:41,550 --> 01:31:43,670
you see these ripples, like it hit the surface

2251
01:31:43,670 --> 01:31:46,105
of a still, glass-like ocean.

2252
01:31:47,310 --> 01:31:48,510
As the ripples go out...

2253
01:31:50,977 --> 01:31:53,090
(thunder rumbling)

2254
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:55,790
You see flashes of lightning in the distance,

2255
01:31:55,790 --> 01:31:58,840
contained within clouds, a storm that sits on the horizon,

2256
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:00,605
every horizon as you look around.

2257
01:32:00,605 --> 01:32:02,652
It's just you and the feather.

2258
01:32:02,652 --> 01:32:05,989
(thunder rumbling)

2259
01:32:05,989 --> 01:32:09,939
The storm rolls and roars louder...

2260
01:32:09,939 --> 01:32:11,039
and louder.

2261
01:32:13,282 --> 01:32:14,557
What do you do?

2262
01:32:17,670 --> 01:32:19,990
ASHLEY: Am I in the water?

2263
01:32:19,990 --> 01:32:20,823
MATT: You glance down

2264
01:32:20,823 --> 01:32:23,440
and you're standing on a similar surface,

2265
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:24,950
though it feels hard.

2266
01:32:24,950 --> 01:32:27,230
Doesn't seem to react to your footfalls.

2267
01:32:27,230 --> 01:32:29,880
The ripples only came out from where the feather hit.

2268
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:35,210
ASHLEY: Can I go towards the feather?

2269
01:32:35,210 --> 01:32:37,240
MATT: Sure. You step.

2270
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:39,075
As you step from the place you were at--

2271
01:32:39,075 --> 01:32:39,916
(footstep)

2272
01:32:39,916 --> 01:32:42,890
your first footstep hits the water in front,

2273
01:32:42,890 --> 01:32:44,470
another ripple comes out.

2274
01:32:44,470 --> 01:32:46,380
The storms--
(thunder rumbling)

2275
01:32:46,380 --> 01:32:48,618
rage even louder with that footstep.

2276
01:32:49,770 --> 01:32:51,100
You take another.

2277
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:53,058
Another ripple through the water.

2278
01:32:53,058 --> 01:32:54,290
(thunder rumbling)

2279
01:32:54,290 --> 01:32:56,900
The storm's getting closer and closer.

2280
01:32:56,900 --> 01:32:59,270
The feather's about four feet from you,

2281
01:32:59,270 --> 01:33:00,728
about as many footsteps.

2282
01:33:05,710 --> 01:33:08,347
ASHLEY: I will keep walking towards it, and...

2283
01:33:14,150 --> 01:33:16,441
I'll just-- I'll look around...

2284
01:33:18,558 --> 01:33:21,649
and reach down to pick it up.

2285
01:33:21,649 --> 01:33:22,990
MATT: Okay.

2286
01:33:22,990 --> 01:33:25,270
With each rushing footstep,

2287
01:33:25,270 --> 01:33:28,100
the storm gets louder and louder.

2288
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:29,550
As you reach towards it,

2289
01:33:29,550 --> 01:33:31,867
there's a flash and an impact.

2290
01:33:31,867 --> 01:33:32,700
(lightning striking)

2291
01:33:32,700 --> 01:33:34,230
You see this burst of energy

2292
01:33:34,230 --> 01:33:36,280
beneath the surface of the water in front of you.

2293
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:38,730
Splashing water and mist spray your face,

2294
01:33:38,730 --> 01:33:40,340
and instinctually, you pull away,

2295
01:33:40,340 --> 01:33:42,200
the feather disturbed on the surface

2296
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:44,490
and then coming to rest again.

2297
01:33:44,490 --> 01:33:49,040
You hear the thunder rolling loud around you still,

2298
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:52,140
and there's that strength for a moment fades,

2299
01:33:52,140 --> 01:33:53,970
and that fear,

2300
01:33:53,970 --> 01:33:58,090
that fear that sent you fleeing from your people,

2301
01:33:58,090 --> 01:34:00,550
that fear that drove you westward,

2302
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:05,075
that same sense of being alone, inconsequential,

2303
01:34:07,460 --> 01:34:08,930
shackled with guilt,

2304
01:34:08,930 --> 01:34:11,900
keeps you from reaching for that feather,

2305
01:34:11,900 --> 01:34:13,170
yet it still lies before you

2306
01:34:13,170 --> 01:34:14,970
as the storm gets louder and louder.

2307
01:34:16,210 --> 01:34:17,176
What do you do?

2308
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:25,380
ASHLEY: I'm going to try to grab it again.

2309
01:34:25,380 --> 01:34:29,655
MATT: Okay. Make a wisdom saving throw
for me if you don't mind.

2310
01:34:31,050 --> 01:34:32,650
SAM: With advantage?
ASHLEY: With advantage.

2311
01:34:32,650 --> 01:34:36,253
MATT: With advantage, because
technically, yeah, you do have it.

2312
01:34:36,253 --> 01:34:37,762
MARISHA: Heroes' dreams.

2313
01:34:37,762 --> 01:34:39,236
ASHLEY: (exhales) That was a one.

2314
01:34:39,236 --> 01:34:41,310
TRAVIS: Saving throw, saving throw.

2315
01:34:43,510 --> 01:34:47,220
ASHLEY: 16.
MATT: 16. (sighs)

2316
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:52,220
As you're going, and initially about to turn,

2317
01:34:52,870 --> 01:34:54,230
that fear filling your soul,

2318
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:57,530
you spin around to look back towards the darkness,

2319
01:34:57,530 --> 01:34:59,870
where you can see the storm is breaking behind you.

2320
01:34:59,870 --> 01:35:02,610
It is more dangerous in front of you,

2321
01:35:02,610 --> 01:35:06,785
and behind you there is promised respite and escape.

2322
01:35:07,990 --> 01:35:11,430
In that moment, the thunder seems to form words.

2323
01:35:13,110 --> 01:35:14,630
This rolling voice

2324
01:35:14,630 --> 01:35:17,030
seems to come out of the storm itself that says,

2325
01:35:19,002 --> 01:35:22,530
"Do not run from yourself.

2326
01:35:24,730 --> 01:35:29,730
"Overcome what faltered,"
(thunder rumbling)

2327
01:35:30,700 --> 01:35:35,360
"and rise stronger."
(thunder rumbling)

2328
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:42,140
You turn back around, swallow hard,

2329
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:43,780
and reach out and grab that feather,

2330
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:48,270
and as you do, there's a brief moment as you grasp it

2331
01:35:48,270 --> 01:35:53,252
that the air seems to buzz with energy.

2332
01:35:53,252 --> 01:35:55,010
that the air seems to buzz with energy.

2333
01:35:55,010 --> 01:35:58,000
That single moment where you sense the anticipation

2334
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:01,130
before something happens, and you look up

2335
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:06,130
just as a streaking blast of pure lightning energy--

2336
01:36:06,134 --> 01:36:07,209
just as a streaking blast of pure lightning energy--

2337
01:36:07,209 --> 01:36:08,670
(lightning crackling)
streaks down towards you.

2338
01:36:08,670 --> 01:36:10,133
What do you do?

2339
01:36:11,491 --> 01:36:13,090
ASHLEY: Hoh, um...

2340
01:36:17,990 --> 01:36:18,823
I...

2341
01:36:22,230 --> 01:36:24,840
I will look up at it and

2342
01:36:27,810 --> 01:36:29,352
I will just say:

2343
01:36:34,670 --> 01:36:36,892
I do not want this fear anymore.

2344
01:36:37,940 --> 01:36:41,950
And I will stand there and wait for it to hit me.

2345
01:36:41,950 --> 01:36:42,783
MATT: Okay.

2346
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:49,000
As you look up in that brief moment,

2347
01:36:50,860 --> 01:36:54,710
without hesitation, you embrace the coming bolt,

2348
01:36:54,710 --> 01:36:59,710
and as it hits you, you just see white.

2349
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:04,740
Your whole body vibrates with power,

2350
01:37:04,740 --> 01:37:08,510
and for a moment you feel like every piece of your body

2351
01:37:08,510 --> 01:37:11,012
is about to break apart and shatter.

2352
01:37:13,730 --> 01:37:16,750
But it just stays at that threshold,

2353
01:37:16,750 --> 01:37:18,610
and you embrace it.

2354
01:37:19,510 --> 01:37:21,208
As the light begins to fade,

2355
01:37:22,140 --> 01:37:25,170
you can now see that dark abyss beneath you

2356
01:37:25,170 --> 01:37:27,660
is alight with this faint blue glow,

2357
01:37:27,660 --> 01:37:30,030
and beneath this glass-like surface,

2358
01:37:30,030 --> 01:37:32,970
10, 20, it's hard to say, 100 feet down,

2359
01:37:32,970 --> 01:37:37,958
it is just an endless underwater hillside scape

2360
01:37:38,850 --> 01:37:41,440
of broken chain link,

2361
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:44,925
tethered and tangled endlessly beneath you.

2362
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:47,330
As you look within your hand,

2363
01:37:47,330 --> 01:37:49,647
you see you hold that single white feather,

2364
01:37:51,550 --> 01:37:53,120
and you look back up into the clouds,

2365
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:55,280
which now have swollen to encompass

2366
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:57,710
the entire sky and horizon around you.

2367
01:37:57,710 --> 01:38:01,772
There is a single hole in the sky above.

2368
01:38:02,670 --> 01:38:05,320
The voice once more crackling through the storm says,

2369
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:09,850
"Show me--"
(thunder rumbling)

2370
01:38:09,850 --> 01:38:14,850
"You can be reborn."
(thunder rumbling)

2371
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:24,244
ASHLEY: Okay.
(laughter)

2372
01:38:24,244 --> 01:38:25,077
Um...

2373
01:38:26,769 --> 01:38:27,810
(exhales)

2374
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:32,550
I bamf out the wings.

2375
01:38:32,550 --> 01:38:33,883
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah!
LIAM: Flex!

2376
01:38:33,883 --> 01:38:36,430
LAURA: (clapping)
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

2377
01:38:36,430 --> 01:38:38,310
MATT: Your wings emerge,

2378
01:38:38,310 --> 01:38:42,970
the withered, skeletal, bone-like black necrotic wings,

2379
01:38:42,970 --> 01:38:46,440
the representation of your fallen self.

2380
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:49,390
The faint beginnings of those feathers you noticed

2381
01:38:49,390 --> 01:38:53,260
still there, clinging to life at the edge

2382
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:55,376
of these almost...

2383
01:38:55,376 --> 01:38:58,676
vestigial extensions of yourself,

2384
01:38:58,676 --> 01:39:02,170
of your guilt, of the emotional turmoil

2385
01:39:02,170 --> 01:39:04,612
that you hold and hoist upon your shoulders.

2386
01:39:06,250 --> 01:39:08,710
And as you look up to the sky,

2387
01:39:08,710 --> 01:39:13,160
you watch like flowers blossoming

2388
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:14,900
on the extended branches of a tree

2389
01:39:15,954 --> 01:39:17,790
in the beginning of spring,

2390
01:39:17,790 --> 01:39:22,510
more feathers begin to emerge and fill,

2391
01:39:22,510 --> 01:39:24,880
and emerge and fill.

2392
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:27,280
And the darkness around you begins to glow,

2393
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:32,280
lit like a lantern that billows and brightens

2394
01:39:32,490 --> 01:39:36,710
as the wings become full, angelic.

2395
01:39:36,710 --> 01:39:39,370
The light itself is white and blue,

2396
01:39:39,370 --> 01:39:43,338
and you can see, between the feathers, little sparks

2397
01:39:43,338 --> 01:39:47,620
(electricity sparking)
of energy.

2398
01:39:49,060 --> 01:39:52,742
As you look up towards that hole once more.

2399
01:39:57,695 --> 01:39:58,528
ASHLEY: Um--

2400
01:40:00,517 --> 01:40:01,684
MATT: You hear a voice.

2401
01:40:03,460 --> 01:40:06,737
Female, familiar, distant, from below.

2402
01:40:11,350 --> 01:40:14,548
You look down, and in the chains,

2403
01:40:18,630 --> 01:40:23,268
you see a female form beckoning.

2404
01:40:24,640 --> 01:40:27,398
The words, you can't quite make out,

2405
01:40:28,590 --> 01:40:29,965
but it's calling to you.

2406
01:40:36,426 --> 01:40:38,333
ASHLEY: (exhales) Oh, god.

2407
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:43,361
Okay, okay, okay.

2408
01:40:43,361 --> 01:40:44,278
Um...

2409
01:40:49,270 --> 01:40:52,065
MATT: It sounds very much like Zuala.

2410
01:40:52,065 --> 01:40:53,657
ASHLEY: (exhales)

2411
01:40:56,310 --> 01:40:57,143
Um...

2412
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:01,150
I crouch down,

2413
01:41:04,610 --> 01:41:06,513
and I put my hand out.

2414
01:41:08,330 --> 01:41:10,070
MATT: It breaks the surface.

2415
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:14,283
And you sense you could...

2416
01:41:15,291 --> 01:41:16,124
go.

2417
01:41:24,121 --> 01:41:25,754
ASHLEY: (exhales)

2418
01:41:31,224 --> 01:41:33,063
(sighs)

2419
01:41:33,063 --> 01:41:34,763
(whispered) I have to go.

2420
01:41:37,020 --> 01:41:40,085
And I'll leap. Leap up.

2421
01:41:40,085 --> 01:41:41,350
TRAVIS: (inhaling sharply)

2422
01:41:41,350 --> 01:41:43,057
MATT: As you withdraw your hand

2423
01:41:44,010 --> 01:41:49,010
and alter your stance into a crouch as the wings unfurl,

2424
01:41:49,210 --> 01:41:53,900
preparing to take their first beat, the voice says,

2425
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:57,366
"I'm proud of you.

2426
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:03,320
"Don't let me be a shackle."

2427
01:42:05,808 --> 01:42:09,810
(beating wings)

2428
01:42:09,810 --> 01:42:12,430
And with renewed strength you've not felt

2429
01:42:12,430 --> 01:42:16,970
from an extension beyond your own arms,

2430
01:42:16,970 --> 01:42:19,040
you fight your way up into the storm,

2431
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:21,288
this tunnel around you of lightning flashing.

2432
01:42:21,288 --> 01:42:22,540
(furious lightning)

2433
01:42:22,540 --> 01:42:23,373
All around you.

2434
01:42:24,270 --> 01:42:26,630
Forcing your way up as high as you can

2435
01:42:26,630 --> 01:42:29,388
until eventually you break past the clouds.

2436
01:42:29,388 --> 01:42:30,570
(rushing air)

2437
01:42:30,570 --> 01:42:35,548
Up into a night sky of stars, and two moons.

2438
01:42:38,790 --> 01:42:41,010
As you look back down, the hole closes.

2439
01:42:42,140 --> 01:42:43,508
The clouds become mist,

2440
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:48,683
and as the mist fades, you're looking down upon...

2441
01:42:51,190 --> 01:42:55,837
land masses, water, Exandria.

2442
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:04,330
And it's a freedom you've not quite felt before,

2443
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:07,332
like you could go anywhere.

2444
01:43:12,420 --> 01:43:13,879
As morning comes to you all.

2445
01:43:13,879 --> 01:43:18,879
(exhaling)
(laughter)

2446
01:43:21,070 --> 01:43:24,310
You all wake up well-rested.

2447
01:43:24,310 --> 01:43:26,000
A little churny in the stomach

2448
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:30,880
based on the maybe not (laughs) balanced meal

2449
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:32,550
many of you enjoyed the night before.

2450
01:43:32,550 --> 01:43:33,650
Except for Caleb.
LIAM: I'm fine.

2451
01:43:33,650 --> 01:43:36,480
MATT: Caleb's fine.
LAURA: (laughs)

2452
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:37,490
But you wake up.

2453
01:43:37,490 --> 01:43:39,670
Well, you would know what time it is.

2454
01:43:39,670 --> 01:43:41,110
LIAM: Would I?

2455
01:43:41,110 --> 01:43:43,852
MATT: You have no sense of-- There is no sun around you.

2456
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:47,100
You guys slept relatively early,

2457
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:50,850
so you're waking up now at about dawn.

2458
01:43:50,850 --> 01:43:54,910
So it's about 5:30 or so in the morning.

2459
01:43:56,136 --> 01:43:57,280
But it's still dark on the inside,

2460
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:59,040
but consciousness takes you.

2461
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:01,608
You wake up, the day is yours.

2462
01:44:03,900 --> 01:44:06,760
TRAVIS: The day is ours? Oh.

2463
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:08,720
SAM: Everybody know who they are?
MARISHA: Yeah.

2464
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:10,130
LAURA: Oh.
MATT: Yeah.

2465
01:44:10,130 --> 01:44:12,433
So I'd like everyone to make Wisdom saving throws, please.

2466
01:44:12,433 --> 01:44:13,266
TRAVIS: Oh.
(laughter)

2467
01:44:13,266 --> 01:44:14,850
ASHLEY: I'll forget what happened last night.

2468
01:44:14,850 --> 01:44:17,328
MATT: ♪ False sense of security. ♪

2469
01:44:17,328 --> 01:44:18,310
TALIESIN: With advantage.
LAURA: With advantage.

2470
01:44:18,310 --> 01:44:19,460
SAM: With advantage?
MATT: With advantage,

2471
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:21,543
because of Heroes' Feast.

2472
01:44:24,270 --> 01:44:27,290
MARISHA: I'm okay.

2473
01:44:27,290 --> 01:44:28,940
TRAVIS: That's off.
TALIESIN: Eesh.

2474
01:44:31,210 --> 01:44:32,460
TRAVIS: 16.
MATT: 16.

2475
01:44:32,460 --> 01:44:33,810
LAURA: 22.
MATT: 22.

2476
01:44:33,810 --> 01:44:34,920
LIAM: 15.
MATT: 15.

2477
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:36,200
SAM: 23.
MATT: 23.

2478
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:37,390
ASHLEY: 16.
MATT: 16.

2479
01:44:37,390 --> 01:44:38,550
TALIESIN: 21.
MATT: 21.

2480
01:44:38,550 --> 01:44:39,812
MARISHA: 16.
MATT: 16.

2481
01:44:39,812 --> 01:44:40,690
(groaning)

2482
01:44:40,690 --> 01:44:41,850
LAURA: Right on this cusp, I think.

2483
01:44:41,850 --> 01:44:43,997
TRAVIS: He's got to roll, though.
MATT: For Vilya.

2484
01:44:43,997 --> 01:44:45,297
SAM: For Vilya.

2485
01:44:46,730 --> 01:44:49,490
MATT: So...
(paper rustling)

2486
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:53,441
Caleb.
LIAM: Yeah?

2487
01:44:53,441 --> 01:44:54,750
SAM: Oh.

2488
01:44:54,750 --> 01:44:57,360
MATT: You're the only person that missed by one.

2489
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:59,207
MARISHA: Oh, shit.

2490
01:45:00,461 --> 01:45:01,580
MATT: When you come to consciousness,

2491
01:45:01,580 --> 01:45:05,390
everyone looks around and you look around,

2492
01:45:05,390 --> 01:45:08,880
taking stock of the friends around you.

2493
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:13,620
It's Fjord, Jester, Veth, Caduceus,

2494
01:45:13,620 --> 01:45:17,410
Beauregard, Yasha, Vilya.

2495
01:45:17,410 --> 01:45:19,285
Good. You remember all that.

2496
01:45:22,390 --> 01:45:23,598
Why are we here?

2497
01:45:26,346 --> 01:45:27,620
There was something you're supposed to be doing here.

2498
01:45:27,620 --> 01:45:28,860
There's ships around you,

2499
01:45:28,860 --> 01:45:30,915
and you came to an island.

2500
01:45:30,915 --> 01:45:32,520
But why? Why were you here?

2501
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:36,020
And you immediately recognize consciously, like, "Oh no."

2502
01:45:36,020 --> 01:45:38,130
Oh no. With your intelligence and self-awareness,

2503
01:45:38,130 --> 01:45:39,680
you know exactly what happened.

2504
01:45:41,011 --> 01:45:43,840
LIAM: So, self-aware of the fact that--

2505
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:46,400
MATT: Because of your high intelligence

2506
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:48,400
and the preparation you guys have done,

2507
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:51,520
you forgetting things, they're fuzzy,

2508
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:56,520
and you being you, can acknowledge that something's wrong.

2509
01:45:56,933 --> 01:45:58,060
LAURA: (chuckling)

2510
01:45:58,060 --> 01:45:59,220
MATT: You don't quite understand what,

2511
01:45:59,220 --> 01:46:01,050
but just something's not right.

2512
01:46:01,050 --> 01:46:01,883
LIAM: I don't...

2513
01:46:01,883 --> 01:46:02,716
I'm...

2514
01:46:04,490 --> 01:46:06,600
You know, I'm a little bit off.

2515
01:46:07,530 --> 01:46:09,088
In a good mood, though.

2516
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:12,160
SAM: You're in a good mood?

2517
01:46:12,160 --> 01:46:13,590
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, then something's definitely off.

2518
01:46:13,590 --> 01:46:15,415
LAURA: Oh, yeah, we better definitely--

2519
01:46:15,415 --> 01:46:16,248
TRAVIS: Tackle him!

2520
01:46:16,248 --> 01:46:19,178
No, I'm just kidding.
(laughter)

2521
01:46:20,350 --> 01:46:23,036
TALIESIN: Which of us wants to take it?

2522
01:46:23,036 --> 01:46:25,900
LAURA: Boulder, Parchment, Shears?
TALIESIN: Boulder, Paper, Shears?

2523
01:46:25,900 --> 01:46:27,731
TRAVIS: Three-way.
MATT: "Certainly.

2524
01:46:27,731 --> 01:46:29,690
"I haven't played this since I was a little girl.

2525
01:46:29,690 --> 01:46:31,475
"Okay, okay."
LAURA: All right.

2526
01:46:31,475 --> 01:46:34,510
MATT: "All right. On three, or three then?"

2527
01:46:34,510 --> 01:46:35,980
LIAM: What are we doing?
LAURA: On three.

2528
01:46:35,980 --> 01:46:38,120
TALIESIN: On three.
LAURA: Okay.

2529
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:40,225
LIAM: Eins, zwei, drei.

2530
01:46:40,225 --> 01:46:41,058
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Wow!

2531
01:46:41,058 --> 01:46:43,090
ASHLEY: Oh my god!
TRAVIS: Go again.

2532
01:46:44,127 --> 01:46:45,760
SAM: Three-way.

2533
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:47,170
LAURA: (groaning)
TRAVIS: You're out.

2534
01:46:47,170 --> 01:46:48,240
LAURA: Oh, wait, that means I lost,

2535
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:49,820
so I should use my spell slot.

2536
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:51,390
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: "Yes."

2537
01:46:51,390 --> 01:46:52,223
LAURA: Hi, Caleb.

2538
01:46:52,223 --> 01:46:54,010
LIAM: What are we doing?
LAURA: How are you doing today?

2539
01:46:54,010 --> 01:46:56,950
LIAM: Doing so--
LAURA: I cast Greater Restoration.

2540
01:46:56,950 --> 01:46:58,550
MATT: Suddenly, all the memories rush back to you.

2541
01:46:58,550 --> 01:47:03,200
You feel that strange alteration is ejected,

2542
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:05,730
like some foreign substance in your lungs,

2543
01:47:05,730 --> 01:47:07,360
but from your mind instead,

2544
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:08,760
like mentally coughing it

2545
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:10,050
from the inside of your brain,

2546
01:47:10,050 --> 01:47:12,420
and then suddenly, oh, you're fine.

2547
01:47:12,420 --> 01:47:13,720
You're fine, you're fine.

2548
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:16,060
LIAM: I had a very tall, erect spine,

2549
01:47:16,060 --> 01:47:17,980
and it just went a little... (groans)

2550
01:47:17,980 --> 01:47:20,780
LAURA: Oh, he's back, you guys.
(laughter)

2551
01:47:20,780 --> 01:47:22,820
ASHLEY: Oh no!
TRAVIS: Oh, everything sucks.

2552
01:47:22,820 --> 01:47:24,180
(laughter)

2553
01:47:24,180 --> 01:47:25,640
SAM: You were smiling for a second!

2554
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:27,290
LAURA: You were happy.
SAM: Aww.

2555
01:47:27,290 --> 01:47:29,280
LIAM: It happens sometimes.
SAM: It looked really weird.

2556
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:30,800
TALIESIN: We knew you wouldn't like it.

2557
01:47:32,580 --> 01:47:33,880
LIAM: Thank you.
LAURA: You're welcome.

2558
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:35,997
LIAM: Ja. Better this way.

2559
01:47:37,290 --> 01:47:38,760
TRAVIS: Yes.
(laughter)

2560
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:39,920
SAM: Was that a question?
TALIESIN: For now.

2561
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:42,800
TRAVIS: Period. Right?
LIAM: Yeah?

2562
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:44,770
LAURA: You're much taller than I realized.

2563
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:47,880
LIAM: Yeah, I'm, you know,

2564
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:49,552
average human height.

2565
01:47:49,552 --> 01:47:51,640
MATT: I would also like everybody
to make an investigation check, please.

2566
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:54,161
LAURA: Oh, man.
MARISHA: Oh, shit.

2567
01:47:56,450 --> 01:48:00,080
TRAVIS: 18.
MATT: 18, all right. Jester?

2568
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:00,970
LAURA: 10.
MATT: 10.

2569
01:48:00,970 --> 01:48:03,280
LIAM: 22.
SAM: 30.

2570
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:05,000
ASHLEY: 22.
TRAVIS: 30!

2571
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:06,530
TALIESIN: Two.
ASHLEY: 30?

2572
01:48:06,530 --> 01:48:08,870
MARISHA: 22.
MATT: You said two, Caduceus?

2573
01:48:08,870 --> 01:48:09,703
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2574
01:48:09,703 --> 01:48:13,910
MATT: All right, if I could have Caduceus and Jester.

2575
01:48:13,910 --> 01:48:17,850
Pick something of your inventory that just is gone.

2576
01:48:17,850 --> 01:48:18,900
You forgot it.

2577
01:48:18,900 --> 01:48:20,332
You don't know where you put it, it's weird.

2578
01:48:20,332 --> 01:48:21,730
TALIESIN: Oh...
LAURA: I don't even know

2579
01:48:21,730 --> 01:48:22,840
what this stuff is for.

2580
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:25,190
I have all these things listed.

2581
01:48:25,190 --> 01:48:27,640
SAM: Yeah, I have a bunch of things in my inventory

2582
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:31,055
that I'm like, "Wait, what?"
(laughter)

2583
01:48:31,055 --> 01:48:34,100
LAURA: I don't think I would ever realize it was missing.

2584
01:48:34,100 --> 01:48:34,970
TRAVIS: At some point I was like,

2585
01:48:34,970 --> 01:48:38,450
"You definitely need that."
LAURA: A belt with a key on it.

2586
01:48:39,330 --> 01:48:41,478
I don't know!
MATT: Sure, it's gone.

2587
01:48:42,750 --> 01:48:44,090
MARISHA: Belt with a key?
LAURA: Yep.

2588
01:48:44,090 --> 01:48:46,150
TRAVIS: It's a belt with a key attached to it?

2589
01:48:46,150 --> 01:48:47,218
LAURA: Yep.
LIAM: Every day, it's got to be like,

2590
01:48:47,218 --> 01:48:48,648
"(sighs) Another ball bearing."

2591
01:48:48,648 --> 01:48:49,655
MARISHA: (laughs)

2592
01:48:49,655 --> 01:48:51,230
MATT: You're going to get back to the Xhorhaus

2593
01:48:51,230 --> 01:48:53,604
and be like, (huffing)

2594
01:48:53,604 --> 01:48:56,544
ASHLEY: How do we get in there?
(laughter)

2595
01:48:56,544 --> 01:48:58,110
TRAVIS: It's got a hell of a lost and found section.

2596
01:48:58,110 --> 01:48:59,040
MATT: Oh, yeah, very much so.

2597
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:00,810
Rosohna's pretty on top of it there.

2598
01:49:02,996 --> 01:49:06,283
LAURA: I'm down to 200G-worth of residuum.

2599
01:49:07,700 --> 01:49:10,250
MATT: But the morning is yours for prep,

2600
01:49:10,250 --> 01:49:11,590
if you wanted to try and speak to

2601
01:49:11,590 --> 01:49:13,210
your friend, Dieter.

2602
01:49:13,210 --> 01:49:15,680
MARISHA: And there's no sign of Dieter?

2603
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:19,530
TALIESIN: Let's talk about this because

2604
01:49:19,530 --> 01:49:21,413
they asked us a question.

2605
01:49:21,413 --> 01:49:24,060
We should be able to answer it with something reasonable.

2606
01:49:24,060 --> 01:49:28,460
LAURA: Yeah, why? He said, "Why should I believe you?"

2607
01:49:28,460 --> 01:49:31,930
Or something.
MATT: That's the idea behind it.

2608
01:49:31,930 --> 01:49:34,400
SAM: Yeah, because we're enemies, right?

2609
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:35,430
Why should he trust us?

2610
01:49:35,430 --> 01:49:37,790
This could be a trap for him.
LAURA: That's true.

2611
01:49:37,790 --> 01:49:39,360
MARISHA: It definitely is a trap for him.

2612
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:43,220
SAM: I think you should be honest.

2613
01:49:43,220 --> 01:49:45,270
Caduceus always recommends honesty.

2614
01:49:45,270 --> 01:49:47,900
Just say, "We have a beef,

2615
01:49:47,900 --> 01:49:52,900
"but you'd be pissing off one of my enemies."

2616
01:49:53,725 --> 01:49:54,566
LAURA: That's true.

2617
01:49:54,566 --> 01:49:55,690
TRAVIS: Maybe we want to make amends

2618
01:49:55,690 --> 01:49:58,350
for our previous transgressions.

2619
01:49:58,350 --> 01:50:01,392
SAM: Yeah, we did turn him into a little thing.

2620
01:50:03,310 --> 01:50:06,850
LIAM: Maybe you could say we
want to sail out of here unscathed.

2621
01:50:07,790 --> 01:50:09,850
LAURA: I've got 25 words, you guys,

2622
01:50:09,850 --> 01:50:12,544
and you know I already have issues.

2623
01:50:12,544 --> 01:50:15,377
(laughter)

2624
01:50:16,590 --> 01:50:18,090
MARISHA: I kind of like the beef angle.

2625
01:50:19,020 --> 01:50:21,540
LAURA: We know you like beef...
(laughter)

2626
01:50:21,540 --> 01:50:22,373
MARISHA: Yeah.

2627
01:50:23,300 --> 01:50:25,830
LAURA: We got you beef...
SAM: Beau loves the beef angle.

2628
01:50:25,830 --> 01:50:28,496
LIAM: That's such a loaded statement.

2629
01:50:28,496 --> 01:50:31,560
(laughter)

2630
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:35,230
MARISHA: Yeah, like, "Look, yeah, we hate you.

2631
01:50:35,230 --> 01:50:38,522
"But congratulations, we hate someone else more than you."

2632
01:50:38,522 --> 01:50:40,860
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2633
01:50:42,730 --> 01:50:43,763
Sending.

2634
01:50:45,490 --> 01:50:46,706
TRAVIS: Send it!

2635
01:50:48,770 --> 01:50:51,724
LAURA: Look.
TRAVIS: Good usage.

2636
01:50:51,724 --> 01:50:52,710
(laughter)

2637
01:50:52,710 --> 01:50:54,950
Every word.
LIAM: Total filler word.

2638
01:50:54,950 --> 01:50:57,610
MARISHA: Great start.
SAM: (like Jester) Here's the deal.

2639
01:50:58,930 --> 01:51:02,270
LIAM: (like Jester) Basically...
(laughter)

2640
01:51:03,217 --> 01:51:06,298
ASHLEY: (like Jester) Hello!
LIAM: (like Jester) Okay, okay, okay, okay...

2641
01:51:06,298 --> 01:51:09,048
(laughter)

2642
01:51:09,910 --> 01:51:14,898
LAURA: We didn't get off on the right foot. But...

2643
01:51:21,290 --> 01:51:26,260
This other guy, way worse than you.

2644
01:51:28,910 --> 01:51:30,573
We like him less.

2645
01:51:31,550 --> 01:51:33,310
That was four words, we like him less.

2646
01:51:33,310 --> 01:51:34,260
TRAVIS: We like him...

2647
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:37,952
We like him less.
LAURA: Him less.

2648
01:51:37,952 --> 01:51:39,060
(laughter)

2649
01:51:39,060 --> 01:51:40,798
TRAVIS: Didn't say I was very good at this.

2650
01:51:40,798 --> 01:51:42,240
MARISHA: (laughs)

2651
01:51:42,240 --> 01:51:44,480
LIAM: Bring it home.

2652
01:51:51,230 --> 01:51:54,077
LAURA: So you should fuck him.

2653
01:51:55,310 --> 01:51:57,009
TRAVIS: Fuck him?
MARISHA: Fuck him?

2654
01:51:57,009 --> 01:51:58,644
LAURA: Fuck him!

2655
01:51:58,644 --> 01:51:59,477
Like, fuck him!

2656
01:51:59,477 --> 01:52:00,740
Like, fuck him over!

2657
01:52:00,740 --> 01:52:01,610
You know, fuck him.

2658
01:52:01,610 --> 01:52:04,825
MARISHA: Wow, that Tongues spell really got to you.

2659
01:52:04,825 --> 01:52:06,945
(laughter)

2660
01:52:06,945 --> 01:52:08,650
You said fuck him in Zemnian.

2661
01:52:08,650 --> 01:52:10,600
That's crazy!
LAURA: Well, it's, you know...

2662
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:13,060
Oh, I should've used the Tongues thing again.

2663
01:52:13,060 --> 01:52:14,890
LIAM: You could have.
LAURA: Fuck.

2664
01:52:14,890 --> 01:52:16,800
SAM: You've got more spells.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2665
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:18,300
SAM: Has he replied?
LAURA: Not yet.

2666
01:52:18,300 --> 01:52:22,192
MATT: Okay. Roll a persuasion check.

2667
01:52:23,406 --> 01:52:25,189
LAURA: Uh-oh.

2668
01:52:25,189 --> 01:52:26,420
MATT: This has been building up to this.

2669
01:52:26,420 --> 01:52:28,740
The conversation's been leading to an actual ask

2670
01:52:28,740 --> 01:52:31,990
that made sense to him, somewhat.

2671
01:52:31,990 --> 01:52:35,000
Roll a persuasion check.
SAM: I will bless you.

2672
01:52:35,860 --> 01:52:37,120
LAURA: Can you do that?
SAM: No.

2673
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:40,040
LAURA: Can I guide myself?
MATT: Hmm.

2674
01:52:40,040 --> 01:52:41,232
LAURA: Not after.
MATT: It's not after, no.

2675
01:52:41,232 --> 01:52:44,280
LIAM: It's happening, it's not like an active--

2676
01:52:44,280 --> 01:52:47,015
LAURA: Oh, god.
LIAM: Come on.

2677
01:52:50,151 --> 01:52:52,740
LAURA: Oh!

2678
01:52:52,740 --> 01:52:54,550
19?
MARISHA: (exclaiming)

2679
01:52:54,550 --> 01:52:58,810
MATT: 19?
LAURA: N-n-n-nineteen!

2680
01:53:02,950 --> 01:53:06,027
MATT: The response comes after a moment, and goes,

2681
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:12,080
"We had discussed,

2682
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:17,560
"I don't need a mate."

2683
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:20,741
LAURA: (laughs)
TRAVIS: Oh no. Oh no.

2684
01:53:24,583 --> 01:53:28,310
MATT: "No, thank you."
LAURA: Aw, man.

2685
01:53:28,310 --> 01:53:30,968
Do I have to send him another message?

2686
01:53:30,968 --> 01:53:32,003
(groans)

2687
01:53:32,003 --> 01:53:33,167
Another message.

2688
01:53:33,167 --> 01:53:36,130
I don't mean sex!

2689
01:53:36,130 --> 01:53:39,980
Fuck him over! Destroy his shit!

2690
01:53:39,980 --> 01:53:43,158
Come get his boats! He sucks!

2691
01:53:45,320 --> 01:53:49,480
There's lots of them.

2692
01:53:52,530 --> 01:53:55,193
We can make amends.
SAM: Hey!

2693
01:53:56,727 --> 01:53:58,328
MATT: (laughs) Roll one more persuasion check.

2694
01:53:58,328 --> 01:53:59,710
LAURA: Oh, balls!

2695
01:53:59,710 --> 01:54:02,513
SAM: I will bless you again. (laughs)

2696
01:54:02,513 --> 01:54:04,130
LAURA: I really should've cast something on--

2697
01:54:04,130 --> 01:54:06,310
Shit! Okay, here we go, here we go.

2698
01:54:06,310 --> 01:54:08,155
Here I go.
(laughter)

2699
01:54:08,155 --> 01:54:11,658
LAURA: (sighing)

2700
01:54:11,658 --> 01:54:13,191
Oh, motherfuck.

2701
01:54:14,350 --> 01:54:16,160
15?
SAM: Ooh, not terrible.

2702
01:54:20,603 --> 01:54:22,800
MATT: The response does not utilize

2703
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:24,270
the plethora of words at its disposal.

2704
01:54:24,270 --> 01:54:25,603
It just says,

2705
01:54:27,160 --> 01:54:30,370
"I'm good."
(groaning)

2706
01:54:30,370 --> 01:54:31,330
That first roll was so close.

2707
01:54:31,330 --> 01:54:32,340
That first roll was so close!

2708
01:54:32,340 --> 01:54:35,330
I'm so sorry!
MARISHA: (sighs)

2709
01:54:36,415 --> 01:54:37,598
Shit.

2710
01:54:39,320 --> 01:54:41,002
SAM: Let's try three more times.

2711
01:54:41,002 --> 01:54:42,930
(laughter)

2712
01:54:42,930 --> 01:54:44,968
TRAVIS: "When you say you're good...

2713
01:54:44,968 --> 01:54:46,870
(laughter)
"You mean..."

2714
01:54:47,775 --> 01:54:49,843
SAM and LAURA: (huffing)
ASHLEY: "Does that mean you're coming, or...?"

2715
01:54:49,843 --> 01:54:54,561
SAM: Our foolproof plan.
MARISHA: Fuck, it was pretty good.

2716
01:54:54,561 --> 01:54:55,394
MATT: It was a good plan.

2717
01:54:55,394 --> 01:54:59,740
It was a tough sell, and it just didn't work out. I'm sorry.

2718
01:55:02,464 --> 01:55:04,014
LAURA: (humming)
TRAVIS: That's okay.

2719
01:55:04,950 --> 01:55:07,290
SAM: What's our second plan?
TRAVIS: I'm having breakfast.

2720
01:55:08,580 --> 01:55:13,580
We're good. We're going to make our way in.

2721
01:55:13,590 --> 01:55:15,130
SAM: If we go in the back way,

2722
01:55:15,130 --> 01:55:18,800
he'll know something's up immediately.

2723
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:19,680
ASHLEY: Yeah, what are we going to say?

2724
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:22,118
Like, we were just exploring the island?

2725
01:55:22,118 --> 01:55:23,849
LAURA: Yeah, we're just exploring.

2726
01:55:23,849 --> 01:55:25,340
What difference does it make? We'll bring him stuff.

2727
01:55:25,340 --> 01:55:27,695
SAM: I think some of us should go in the front.

2728
01:55:27,695 --> 01:55:28,950
TRAVIS: How do we get over there quickly?

2729
01:55:28,950 --> 01:55:30,890
SAM: Vilya can take us over there quickly.

2730
01:55:30,890 --> 01:55:33,450
LAURA: That's wasting so many spells
before we even get in there.

2731
01:55:33,450 --> 01:55:35,210
I've just wasted three fucking spells

2732
01:55:35,210 --> 01:55:36,670
before we even got in.
SAM: If we go in the back, what are we doing?

2733
01:55:36,670 --> 01:55:39,310
Like, "Hey, we're here to surprise you

2734
01:55:39,310 --> 01:55:41,340
"with more gifts from your back door

2735
01:55:41,340 --> 01:55:42,750
"that you told us not to use!"

2736
01:55:42,750 --> 01:55:43,930
LAURA: He knows we're here already.

2737
01:55:43,930 --> 01:55:46,030
LIAM: Already knows we're here, yeah.

2738
01:55:46,030 --> 01:55:48,740
LAURA: He knows that Caduceus
already got sucked into the hole.

2739
01:55:48,740 --> 01:55:49,740
We know the hole is there.

2740
01:55:49,740 --> 01:55:51,060
We can be like, "Well, you know,

2741
01:55:51,060 --> 01:55:52,530
"we didn't want to have to go all the way around

2742
01:55:52,530 --> 01:55:53,540
"so we came this way."

2743
01:55:53,540 --> 01:55:54,750
MATT: "I can try and continue

2744
01:55:54,750 --> 01:55:56,930
"to play the position I've had with him

2745
01:55:56,930 --> 01:55:59,160
"since I've arrived and play it off

2746
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:01,340
"as some sort of additional delivery.

2747
01:56:01,340 --> 01:56:03,180
"He did seem to be really into

2748
01:56:03,180 --> 01:56:04,900
"some of the things you were carrying."

2749
01:56:04,900 --> 01:56:07,635
TRAVIS: (with a mouth full of food) I, um--

2750
01:56:07,635 --> 01:56:10,890
These scones are so good.
SAM: (laughs)

2751
01:56:10,890 --> 01:56:13,390
I kind of took my sword back,

2752
01:56:13,390 --> 01:56:18,040
so if he sees me, I don't think he'll be too pleased.

2753
01:56:18,040 --> 01:56:20,740
SAM: You can disguise yourself.
LIAM: He sees you right now.

2754
01:56:21,967 --> 01:56:23,894
TRAVIS: Don't we think he'll see through that stuff?

2755
01:56:23,894 --> 01:56:24,819
LAURA: (unsure noise)
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2756
01:56:24,819 --> 01:56:27,560
TRAVIS: You're right, it won't work.
LAURA: Give it a try.

2757
01:56:28,490 --> 01:56:29,920
TRAVIS: What do you mean?

2758
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:30,897
SAM: Make yourself look like Terra.

2759
01:56:30,897 --> 01:56:33,280
LAURA: Hey, you could also do the astral dreadnought thing.

2760
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:37,497
TRAVIS: I'll make myself look like Lukash.

2761
01:56:38,450 --> 01:56:39,952
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Mask of Many Faces.

2762
01:56:39,952 --> 01:56:40,943
(pulsing magic)

2763
01:56:40,943 --> 01:56:42,650
MATT: You take on the full orcish form

2764
01:56:42,650 --> 01:56:46,020
of the surprisingly debonair Lukash.

2765
01:56:48,430 --> 01:56:50,190
TRAVIS: Full orc. Yeah.
TALIESIN: I'm not going to argue.

2766
01:56:50,190 --> 01:56:52,842
It's a look.
TRAVIS: Thank you.

2767
01:56:52,842 --> 01:56:54,010
I forget what he sounds like.

2768
01:56:54,010 --> 01:56:55,660
Maybe I'll just nod.

2769
01:56:57,800 --> 01:57:01,670
LAURA: Well, he probably doesn't talk to Vokodo anyway,

2770
01:57:01,670 --> 01:57:02,840
and Vokodo can't hear people,

2771
01:57:02,840 --> 01:57:05,210
so he doesn't know what he sounds like anyway.

2772
01:57:05,210 --> 01:57:08,000
TALIESIN: In theory, he may have
just watched you change form.

2773
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,970
So. (clears throat)
LAURA: (laughs)

2774
01:57:09,970 --> 01:57:11,550
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Maybe.

2775
01:57:11,550 --> 01:57:14,410
Maybe he was paying attention to something else at the time.

2776
01:57:14,410 --> 01:57:15,810
SAM: Maybe he just knows our position,

2777
01:57:15,810 --> 01:57:18,420
but doesn't see our every move.

2778
01:57:18,420 --> 01:57:21,557
MARISHA: Yeah. We're like beacons on a map.

2779
01:57:21,557 --> 01:57:22,447
SAM: Yeah.

2780
01:57:22,447 --> 01:57:25,700
MATT: Vilya nods and is like,

2781
01:57:25,700 --> 01:57:29,300
"He doesn't seem to be aware
of the goings on in the village,

2782
01:57:29,300 --> 01:57:31,032
"or any specifics.

2783
01:57:31,970 --> 01:57:33,970
"Vokodo has previously been prone

2784
01:57:33,970 --> 01:57:36,802
"to ask what's been happening.

2785
01:57:38,227 --> 01:57:41,030
"So there might be something to that."

2786
01:57:41,030 --> 01:57:42,140
TALIESIN: We could be just as shocked

2787
01:57:42,140 --> 01:57:43,740
coming through there as anybody.

2788
01:57:45,104 --> 01:57:46,300
LAURA: How'd we get here?!

2789
01:57:46,300 --> 01:57:48,910
(babbling)
SAM: Oh, wow.

2790
01:57:48,910 --> 01:57:49,743
LAURA: Oh my gosh!

2791
01:57:49,743 --> 01:57:51,590
ASHLEY: Exploring, and one of us got pulled through,

2792
01:57:51,590 --> 01:57:52,423
and we followed, and...

2793
01:57:52,423 --> 01:57:54,740
SAM: This isn't the bathroom. What?

2794
01:57:54,740 --> 01:57:57,480
MARISHA: We took eight wrong turns!
TALIESIN: Little more together for it,

2795
01:57:57,480 --> 01:58:00,692
and here we are.
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm.

2796
01:58:00,692 --> 01:58:01,933
SAM: Okay, okay.

2797
01:58:01,933 --> 01:58:04,270
LIAM: He at least knows where we are.

2798
01:58:04,270 --> 01:58:05,660
He knows that an offering

2799
01:58:05,660 --> 01:58:08,102
that Fjord has made has been withdrawn.

2800
01:58:09,180 --> 01:58:12,920
We are in a place, correct me if I'm wrong,

2801
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:16,107
where islanders have been forbidden to go.

2802
01:58:17,650 --> 01:58:19,700
MATT: This island?
LIAM: No, this area.

2803
01:58:19,700 --> 01:58:21,500
MATT: Oh, this area's been forbidden, yeah.

2804
01:58:21,500 --> 01:58:22,680
LAURA: But he already knows we're here.

2805
01:58:22,680 --> 01:58:23,513
LIAM: Yeah, of course.

2806
01:58:23,513 --> 01:58:25,200
I'm just, I guess, lamenting the fact

2807
01:58:25,200 --> 01:58:27,350
that Dieter did not come.

2808
01:58:27,350 --> 01:58:29,830
LAURA: Yeah, well, I'm lamenting that, too.

2809
01:58:29,830 --> 01:58:31,890
LIAM: We're not in a great position.

2810
01:58:31,890 --> 01:58:33,840
SAM: Just to throw it out there,

2811
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:35,840
it's not a good plan.

2812
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:36,800
You're going to say no,

2813
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:38,100
but I'm just going to throw it out there anyway.

2814
01:58:38,100 --> 01:58:39,560
TRAVIS: Here it comes. Let's have it.

2815
01:58:39,560 --> 01:58:42,110
SAM: Dieter was going to be lured here

2816
01:58:42,110 --> 01:58:46,730
to destroy some ships and draw out Vokodo.

2817
01:58:46,730 --> 01:58:50,760
Why do we need Dieter to destroy some ships?

2818
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:52,791
Couldn't we just blow up some fuckin' ships?

2819
01:58:52,791 --> 01:58:53,970
TRAVIS: What would we use to blow up--

2820
01:58:53,970 --> 01:58:56,580
Oh no.
MARISHA: I was going to suggest,

2821
01:58:56,580 --> 01:58:58,380
maybe we keep the, like,

2822
01:58:58,380 --> 01:59:00,770
find something else that's big and bad

2823
01:59:00,770 --> 01:59:02,540
and likes to fight things thing

2824
01:59:02,540 --> 01:59:04,550
and polymorph it and take it in with us.

2825
01:59:04,550 --> 01:59:09,110
Like, we could go get one of those creepy panther things.

2826
01:59:09,110 --> 01:59:09,943
I don't know.

2827
01:59:09,943 --> 01:59:12,560
I'm trying to preserve the plan.

2828
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:14,350
SAM: Or we could just burn all the ships with fire.

2829
01:59:14,350 --> 01:59:17,640
LAURA: What if we bust out the ceiling on here?

2830
01:59:18,732 --> 01:59:21,960
SAM: Oh. And just make it rain rocks?

2831
01:59:21,960 --> 01:59:24,360
LAURA: See how many ships we can take out with that.

2832
01:59:24,360 --> 01:59:26,060
SAM: How do we do that?

2833
01:59:26,060 --> 01:59:28,070
LAURA: I would think we would do it from above,

2834
01:59:28,070 --> 01:59:30,332
because if we're down here, woof.

2835
01:59:31,350 --> 01:59:33,820
SAM: But, like, with what?

2836
01:59:33,820 --> 01:59:36,255
TRAVIS: If you blew up two of the ships with--

2837
01:59:36,255 --> 01:59:37,723
Do you have any of your--

2838
01:59:37,723 --> 01:59:38,556
I don't want to say it.

2839
01:59:38,556 --> 01:59:40,510
SAM: I've got some things.
TRAVIS: Right.

2840
01:59:40,510 --> 01:59:43,600
We could see if he's going to come out of his nest.

2841
01:59:43,600 --> 01:59:47,680
If not, question answered.

2842
01:59:49,440 --> 01:59:51,330
SAM: Sure.
MARISHA: We could try and find

2843
01:59:51,330 --> 01:59:54,130
a great white in the ocean?

2844
01:59:54,130 --> 01:59:55,900
TRAVIS: Sorry, what?
MARISHA: A shark.

2845
01:59:55,900 --> 01:59:57,517
TRAVIS: You were going to go
fishing for a great white shark?

2846
01:59:57,517 --> 01:59:59,072
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, yeah.

2847
01:59:59,072 --> 02:00:00,121
TRAVIS: Do you have a good charter

2848
02:00:00,121 --> 02:00:02,380
that knows where the great white shark hunting ground...

2849
02:00:02,380 --> 02:00:04,520
MARISHA: You tell me, Captain Tusktooth.

2850
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:05,644
TRAVIS: They're not around here.

2851
02:00:05,644 --> 02:00:09,344
MARISHA: Do we-- I'm trying to preserve the Dieter plan.

2852
02:00:10,640 --> 02:00:13,055
The Derek Dieter plan.
SAM: We could be Dieter.

2853
02:00:13,055 --> 02:00:14,180
You can be a great white shark.

2854
02:00:14,180 --> 02:00:15,120
TRAVIS: Oh, you were going to do like,

2855
02:00:15,120 --> 02:00:16,330
"Here, Dieter, Dieter, Dieter!"

2856
02:00:16,330 --> 02:00:18,520
with a great white shark or something?

2857
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:22,470
MARISHA: No, like, "Here, Guaca, Guaca, Guacamole!"

2858
02:00:22,470 --> 02:00:23,830
But with a great white shark.

2859
02:00:23,830 --> 02:00:24,663
I don't know.

2860
02:00:24,663 --> 02:00:27,340
I'm trying to figure it out, man!

2861
02:00:27,340 --> 02:00:28,881
I'm sad about Dieter too.

2862
02:00:28,881 --> 02:00:30,160
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm with you.

2863
02:00:30,160 --> 02:00:32,850
TALIESIN: We're all sad about Dieter.
MARISHA: We're all sad about Dieter.

2864
02:00:32,850 --> 02:00:34,450
LAURA: Sorry, you guys.

2865
02:00:34,450 --> 02:00:35,800
MARISHA: No, he sucks.

2866
02:00:35,800 --> 02:00:36,633
TRAVIS: You had the idea.

2867
02:00:36,633 --> 02:00:39,240
That was more than we had.
ASHLEY: It was a very good idea,

2868
02:00:39,240 --> 02:00:41,560
MARISHA: And further proof that he should really get laid.

2869
02:00:41,560 --> 02:00:43,020
TALIESIN: Yeah, you tried to invite him to a party.

2870
02:00:43,020 --> 02:00:45,010
It was his decision not to come.

2871
02:00:45,010 --> 02:00:47,926
SAM: Should I light a ship on fire?

2872
02:00:47,926 --> 02:00:48,940
TRAVIS: I think we should probably blow up

2873
02:00:48,940 --> 02:00:51,990
at least two of them, yeah.
MARISHA: Let's destroy some ships.

2874
02:00:51,990 --> 02:00:53,990
I like it.
LAURA: However.

2875
02:00:53,990 --> 02:00:56,930
LIAM: We're not at all worried that he's going to

2876
02:00:56,930 --> 02:00:59,117
unleash the volcano's wrath in retribution?

2877
02:00:59,117 --> 02:01:00,562
ASHLEY: I was just going to say.
TALIESIN: I mean, yeah.

2878
02:01:00,562 --> 02:01:05,120
LAURA: Also, if we do that, then we can't play off the idea

2879
02:01:05,120 --> 02:01:06,900
of Vilya going in and saying, like,

2880
02:01:06,900 --> 02:01:09,360
"Yeah, we're here to offer you some more things."

2881
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:11,393
That's out the window.

2882
02:01:11,393 --> 02:01:13,820
SAM: All right, well then let's follow that plan.

2883
02:01:13,820 --> 02:01:15,980
Say we go in the back door with Vilya saying,

2884
02:01:15,980 --> 02:01:18,330
"Hey, we came in the back door to give you prizes."

2885
02:01:18,330 --> 02:01:19,447
Then what?

2886
02:01:19,447 --> 02:01:20,288
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2887
02:01:20,288 --> 02:01:22,760
SAM: Do we give him something, or do we just attack?

2888
02:01:22,760 --> 02:01:27,540
TRAVIS: He seems to be pretty smart, right?

2889
02:01:27,540 --> 02:01:28,910
SAM: I mean, we could make a present.

2890
02:01:28,910 --> 02:01:31,960
I could put fluffernutter in some sort of a bowl

2891
02:01:31,960 --> 02:01:33,580
or something, and we can hand it to him,

2892
02:01:33,580 --> 02:01:34,950
and then make it blow up.

2893
02:01:34,950 --> 02:01:37,160
TALIESIN: While we're in a small confined room with him.

2894
02:01:37,160 --> 02:01:40,130
TRAVIS: Even if his guard is
slightly down, it's still a fight.

2895
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:41,400
We're not going to sneak up on him

2896
02:01:41,400 --> 02:01:43,515
or surprise him or ambush him.

2897
02:01:43,515 --> 02:01:45,210
We're still going to him.
LAURA: Right.

2898
02:01:45,210 --> 02:01:47,000
TRAVIS: We're trying to see
if we get him to come out, right?

2899
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,314
So it's worth the shot.

2900
02:01:49,314 --> 02:01:51,210
LAURA: Let's try to blow some things up.
MARISHA: Try to fight him on his home turf.

2901
02:01:51,210 --> 02:01:53,690
Underwater, by the way.

2902
02:01:53,690 --> 02:01:56,190
TRAVIS: Which we can breathe, but we're slow.
MARISHA: That's not cool.

2903
02:01:56,190 --> 02:01:59,450
LAURA: And also, we can cast--

2904
02:02:01,200 --> 02:02:04,130
Before we do it, I should cast Freedom of Movement,

2905
02:02:04,130 --> 02:02:07,221
because it lasts for an hour.

2906
02:02:07,221 --> 02:02:08,827
MARISHA: One hour.

2907
02:02:08,827 --> 02:02:13,657
TALIESIN: That eats into our Banish.

2908
02:02:13,657 --> 02:02:15,510
TRAVIS: DM, do we remember how long it took us

2909
02:02:15,510 --> 02:02:18,333
to traverse from the first entrance to where he was?

2910
02:02:18,333 --> 02:02:20,640
LAURA: But it's important.

2911
02:02:20,640 --> 02:02:23,040
MATT: From the first entrance, it was about maybe--

2912
02:02:25,030 --> 02:02:25,980
LIAM: Caleb would remember.

2913
02:02:25,980 --> 02:02:28,500
MATT: Probably about an hour or so of travel,

2914
02:02:28,500 --> 02:02:30,345
but that's also because you guys were being careful

2915
02:02:30,345 --> 02:02:32,920
and finding your way

2916
02:02:32,920 --> 02:02:35,560
as Vilya was leading you at a casual pace.

2917
02:02:35,560 --> 02:02:38,530
TRAVIS: So Freedom of Movement at the last minute, right?

2918
02:02:38,530 --> 02:02:41,150
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: Right before we go in, yeah..

2919
02:02:41,150 --> 02:02:44,650
MATT: Also, you do have

2920
02:02:44,650 --> 02:02:47,690
the residuum for the Glyph of Warding thing

2921
02:02:47,690 --> 02:02:49,940
you were also talking about last time.

2922
02:02:49,940 --> 02:02:51,190
LAURA: Oh, yeah, that's right.

2923
02:02:51,190 --> 02:02:52,900
We could use the residuum for that.

2924
02:02:54,040 --> 02:02:57,290
SAM: To put a bomb on something, right?
LAURA: Yeah.

2925
02:02:58,410 --> 02:02:59,243
TALIESIN: I mean, if we really want,

2926
02:02:59,243 --> 02:03:02,190
we can also do a group Water Walk, if anyone's got that.

2927
02:03:03,750 --> 02:03:05,060
LAURA: Yeah, but that's for surface.

2928
02:03:05,060 --> 02:03:07,050
TALIESIN: I mean, if we want to just

2929
02:03:07,050 --> 02:03:09,400
not deal with underwater at all.

2930
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:11,020
LAURA: But he's completely underwater.

2931
02:03:11,020 --> 02:03:12,300
LIAM: He's submerged.
TALIESIN: Mm.

2932
02:03:12,300 --> 02:03:15,792
LIAM: And we don't know where we're going to be facing him.

2933
02:03:17,260 --> 02:03:18,187
MARISHA: Okay.

2934
02:03:18,187 --> 02:03:20,460
TRAVIS: But good if he comes here.

2935
02:03:20,460 --> 02:03:22,560
TALIESIN: We have a couple Freedom of Movements, but it does

2936
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:24,559
cut into our Banishment.

2937
02:03:24,559 --> 02:03:25,800
LAURA: Yeah.

2938
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:27,010
MARISHA: Yeah, it's just a matter of--

2939
02:03:27,010 --> 02:03:28,293
Okay, okay.

2940
02:03:29,376 --> 02:03:31,900
SAM: So far, our resources were:

2941
02:03:31,900 --> 02:03:35,430
the ghosts at the Ruins, (clicks tongue)

2942
02:03:35,430 --> 02:03:37,840
the dragon turtle, (clicks tongue)

2943
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:40,900
the element of surprise, (clicks tongue)

2944
02:03:40,900 --> 02:03:43,760
any member of the village, (clicks tongue)

2945
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:47,300
our own ship, (clicks tongue).

2946
02:03:47,300 --> 02:03:49,520
That's it. (laughs)
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2947
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:53,913
Somehow, we found ourselves back to... fluffernutter.

2948
02:03:53,913 --> 02:03:55,400
LIAM: So we start with fluffernutter.

2949
02:03:55,400 --> 02:03:57,490
We hope that we can lure him in here,

2950
02:03:57,490 --> 02:03:58,470
and if it does not work,

2951
02:03:58,470 --> 02:04:01,360
we have to be prepared to get a message out to Vo

2952
02:04:01,360 --> 02:04:04,640
for them to evacuate, or be on alert,

2953
02:04:04,640 --> 02:04:08,420
in case he dumps from above, the volcano.

2954
02:04:09,290 --> 02:04:10,830
They could build another village.

2955
02:04:10,830 --> 02:04:11,663
TRAVIS: They could.

2956
02:04:11,663 --> 02:04:15,553
I also feel like they might just see it, right?

2957
02:04:15,553 --> 02:04:17,100
If it starts to make a sound, a rumble,

2958
02:04:17,100 --> 02:04:18,220
or earthquakes.

2959
02:04:18,220 --> 02:04:19,970
I mean, unless they're just stupid.

2960
02:04:20,890 --> 02:04:23,740
MARISHA: I mean, Vilya, we're hoping you all didn't build Vo

2961
02:04:23,740 --> 02:04:26,540
in a direct lava flow path, did you?

2962
02:04:26,540 --> 02:04:27,840
I mean, I guess it doesn't really matter

2963
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:29,497
if the whole thing blows, but--

2964
02:04:29,497 --> 02:04:31,653
TRAVIS: You didn't build a channel down from the top.

2965
02:04:31,653 --> 02:04:33,535
MATT: "No. No, we did not.

2966
02:04:34,970 --> 02:04:36,630
"But I also haven't seen the volcano erupt

2967
02:04:36,630 --> 02:04:39,830
"to its full capabilities."

2968
02:04:39,830 --> 02:04:40,663
TRAVIS: (laughs)

2969
02:04:40,663 --> 02:04:43,333
This is some shit the DM would do.

2970
02:04:43,333 --> 02:04:46,070
Like, you piss off a god and we kill a whole village.

2971
02:04:46,070 --> 02:04:48,245
MARISHA: We kill the village.
TRAVIS: (laughs)

2972
02:04:48,245 --> 02:04:49,913
We trigger Pompeii.

2973
02:04:49,913 --> 02:04:52,060
SAM: We'll probably get a little bit of a warning.

2974
02:04:52,060 --> 02:04:53,410
Like, if he sees a ship blow up,

2975
02:04:53,410 --> 02:04:55,420
he's not going to just click the nuke.

2976
02:04:55,420 --> 02:04:57,540
He's going to come see what it is first, right?

2977
02:04:57,540 --> 02:05:00,370
TALIESIN: Figure out what's happening.
SAM: Yeah.

2978
02:05:00,370 --> 02:05:04,210
LIAM: If he can't see the
specifics of what we're doing, he-- hmm.

2979
02:05:04,210 --> 02:05:06,640
Such a tough call.
TALIESIN: It may be an accident.

2980
02:05:06,640 --> 02:05:08,510
He may ask us what's happening.

2981
02:05:08,510 --> 02:05:10,510
TRAVIS: We don't know how to draw him out.

2982
02:05:10,510 --> 02:05:12,800
We don't know how to warn them.

2983
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,300
Got to just commit, go in.

2984
02:05:16,300 --> 02:05:17,358
SAM: To what, going in?

2985
02:05:17,358 --> 02:05:18,720
TRAVIS: Well, I say we blow up the ships.

2986
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:19,960
If he doesn't come out, we go in.

2987
02:05:19,960 --> 02:05:21,540
SAM: Sure.
MARISHA: Okay.

2988
02:05:21,540 --> 02:05:23,540
LIAM: Yeah, because if he comes, he's going to come.

2989
02:05:23,540 --> 02:05:25,110
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LIAM: Fairly quickly.

2990
02:05:25,110 --> 02:05:28,120
TRAVIS: Hard and loud and yeah. I mean, you would think.

2991
02:05:28,120 --> 02:05:30,390
Unless he can do shit we don't anticipate,

2992
02:05:30,390 --> 02:05:33,940
which is very likely.

2993
02:05:33,940 --> 02:05:34,773
MARISHA: Shit.

2994
02:05:35,770 --> 02:05:38,666
And yeah, by the way, the fluffernutter thing.

2995
02:05:38,666 --> 02:05:40,950
I don't know fire damage is the right way to go

2996
02:05:40,950 --> 02:05:43,110
with a volcano god.

2997
02:05:43,110 --> 02:05:44,830
SAM: I'm not going to blow him up.
LIAM: Yeah, just his property.

2998
02:05:44,830 --> 02:05:46,760
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2999
02:05:46,760 --> 02:05:49,710
Just, there was a fluffernutter plan.

3000
02:05:49,710 --> 02:05:51,310
SAM: Oh, oh, yes, yes, yes, you're right.

3001
02:05:51,310 --> 02:05:52,980
You're totally right, yeah.

3002
02:05:52,980 --> 02:05:55,005
TALIESIN: Avoid fire.

3003
02:05:55,005 --> 02:05:55,838
TRAVIS: Woo!

3004
02:05:55,838 --> 02:05:57,683
I'm excited.
ASHLEY: Me too.

3005
02:05:57,683 --> 02:05:58,883
LAURA: (laughs)

3006
02:05:58,883 --> 02:06:01,140
TRAVIS: I really feel like we've covered all the bases here,

3007
02:06:01,140 --> 02:06:03,590
and in no way could analysis after the fact

3008
02:06:03,590 --> 02:06:05,566
reveal anything we haven't thought of.

3009
02:06:05,566 --> 02:06:07,050
(laughter)

3010
02:06:07,050 --> 02:06:08,860
MARISHA: So true.
TRAVIS: Airtight!

3011
02:06:08,860 --> 02:06:11,740
LIAM: Jester, do you have the
ability to send any more messages

3012
02:06:11,740 --> 02:06:14,640
in case time passes and nothing?
SAM: Speaking of airtight--

3013
02:06:14,640 --> 02:06:16,280
LAURA: Sure.
SAM: The entire chamber fills up with smoke.

3014
02:06:16,280 --> 02:06:18,073
LIAM: I'm just saying in case.

3015
02:06:19,010 --> 02:06:21,268
LAURA: I can send more messages, sure.

3016
02:06:21,268 --> 02:06:23,230
I've got plenty more open slots right now.

3017
02:06:23,230 --> 02:06:24,680
It's just-- (laughs)

3018
02:06:24,680 --> 02:06:28,337
It's just--
LIAM: I understand the problem.

3019
02:06:28,337 --> 02:06:29,803
TRAVIS: (laughing) I know.

3020
02:06:29,803 --> 02:06:32,450
TALIESIN: It's nonstop.

3021
02:06:32,450 --> 02:06:35,240
LIAM: I still want the ability to warn a lot of people

3022
02:06:35,240 --> 02:06:39,040
that we've drawn the wrath of a god upon their heads.

3023
02:06:39,040 --> 02:06:40,240
LAURA: Yeah.

3024
02:06:40,240 --> 02:06:45,030
MARISHA: Vilya, is there any type of
alert system in the village?

3025
02:06:45,030 --> 02:06:47,550
Do you have anything, anyone,

3026
02:06:47,550 --> 02:06:49,160
that you can send a message to?

3027
02:06:50,770 --> 02:06:53,540
MATT: "I don't have the capabilities

3028
02:06:53,540 --> 02:06:56,440
"that your friend here does, unfortunately.

3029
02:06:57,870 --> 02:06:59,230
"I'm usually one of the few

3030
02:06:59,230 --> 02:07:02,200
"that sets up a flare of some kind.

3031
02:07:02,200 --> 02:07:03,945
"I can alter the sky.

3032
02:07:05,040 --> 02:07:08,300
"We do have bells arranged throughout the village

3033
02:07:08,300 --> 02:07:10,510
"that in case something is coming to attack--"

3034
02:07:10,510 --> 02:07:13,600
MARISHA: Okay. You know, they've got bells.

3035
02:07:13,600 --> 02:07:15,770
TALIESIN: If the volcano were to start making noise,

3036
02:07:15,770 --> 02:07:17,540
would people know to--?

3037
02:07:17,540 --> 02:07:18,780
MATT: "They would know Vokodo was angry

3038
02:07:18,780 --> 02:07:20,560
"if it began to erupt.

3039
02:07:20,560 --> 02:07:22,710
"They wouldn't stand in the way of the flow.

3040
02:07:25,768 --> 02:07:27,418
"They rely on me to keep him calm."

3041
02:07:30,570 --> 02:07:31,640
TALIESIN: We may just have to trust

3042
02:07:31,640 --> 02:07:34,480
that people are going to act in their own interest.

3043
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:36,080
LIAM: Yeah, which, the problem is

3044
02:07:36,080 --> 02:07:37,420
we don't know what he's going to do.

3045
02:07:37,420 --> 02:07:38,253
TALIESIN: No.

3046
02:07:41,170 --> 02:07:43,650
MATT: "So what's the plan?"

3047
02:07:43,650 --> 02:07:46,710
SAM: We just have to trust that the V.O. community

3048
02:07:46,710 --> 02:07:49,653
is filled with smart, smart people--

3049
02:07:49,653 --> 02:07:52,403
(laughter)
who are not--

3050
02:07:55,119 --> 02:07:58,130
who have no egos.
(laughter)

3051
02:07:58,130 --> 02:07:59,830
Just think about the greater good.

3052
02:08:02,160 --> 02:08:03,310
LIAM: Hopefully they're all good at messaging.

3053
02:08:03,310 --> 02:08:05,470
TRAVIS: What level is Messaging?
(laughter)

3054
02:08:05,470 --> 02:08:07,280
LAURA: Third.
TRAVIS: Oof.

3055
02:08:07,280 --> 02:08:08,150
MARISHA: They're all definitely people

3056
02:08:08,150 --> 02:08:09,410
I'd love to have a beer with.

3057
02:08:09,410 --> 02:08:10,468
That's for sure.

3058
02:08:10,468 --> 02:08:11,640
LAURA: So I could do--

3059
02:08:11,640 --> 02:08:15,657
the Glyph of Warding would use

3060
02:08:15,657 --> 02:08:18,890
200 more residuum powder.

3061
02:08:20,620 --> 02:08:22,560
MARISHA: I know, we're starting
to run out of resources, too.

3062
02:08:22,560 --> 02:08:23,800
That's the other thing.

3063
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:25,280
We've been here so long,

3064
02:08:25,280 --> 02:08:26,940
we're going to deplete our resources.

3065
02:08:28,179 --> 02:08:31,050
SAM: The Glyph would only do one attack, right?

3066
02:08:31,050 --> 02:08:33,070
It's just a few.
LAURA: Yeah.

3067
02:08:33,070 --> 02:08:36,130
It's 5d8, if he doesn't make the save.

3068
02:08:36,130 --> 02:08:40,990
It's a 5d8 whatever kind of damage we want it to be.

3069
02:08:40,990 --> 02:08:42,760
TALIESIN: And it can't move, right?

3070
02:08:42,760 --> 02:08:45,230
SAM: It's not terribly much.

3071
02:08:45,230 --> 02:08:46,290
LIAM: The original idea was

3072
02:08:46,290 --> 02:08:47,740
to have that be that kind of gift thing,

3073
02:08:47,740 --> 02:08:49,630
but if he's coming, busting out

3074
02:08:49,630 --> 02:08:53,280
into this boat lot--
MARISHA: It doesn't matter, yeah.

3075
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:54,150
LAURA: Nah.

3076
02:08:54,150 --> 02:08:56,178
MARISHA: Whatever. Should we start blowing up some boats?

3077
02:08:56,178 --> 02:08:58,636
SAM: (laughs)

3078
02:08:58,636 --> 02:08:59,711
Yep, that's our planning.
TALIESIN: I cannot believe

3079
02:08:59,711 --> 02:09:01,630
that I'm in complete agreement over this.

3080
02:09:01,630 --> 02:09:03,550
SAM: When it doubt, blow up a boat.

3081
02:09:03,550 --> 02:09:05,220
MARISHA: Let's do it.
SAM: Yeah.

3082
02:09:05,220 --> 02:09:07,890
I will not use fluffernutter.

3083
02:09:07,890 --> 02:09:11,215
I will use my other bomb,

3084
02:09:12,448 --> 02:09:13,673
my depth charge.

3085
02:09:13,673 --> 02:09:15,620
TALIESIN: Are we going to be clever about this?

3086
02:09:16,570 --> 02:09:18,170
LIAM: Doesn't seem like it.
ASHLEY: What does that mean?

3087
02:09:18,170 --> 02:09:19,300
LAURA: Why start now?

3088
02:09:19,300 --> 02:09:20,133
TALIESIN: Are we going to decide where to put them

3089
02:09:20,133 --> 02:09:22,177
or just put them willy nilly?

3090
02:09:22,177 --> 02:09:26,460
SAM: Well, there's a few boats that we can choose from.

3091
02:09:26,460 --> 02:09:28,510
I don't want to do the fanciest one, right?

3092
02:09:28,510 --> 02:09:30,260
That's Eden's Horizon.
MATT: Correct.

3093
02:09:30,260 --> 02:09:33,230
SAM: There's also the Banshee, the Mistral, the Fiona.

3094
02:09:33,230 --> 02:09:34,900
Any of these look like--?

3095
02:09:34,900 --> 02:09:36,989
TRAVIS: Good blowing up ship?
MARISHA: We should definitely blow up the Fiona.

3096
02:09:36,989 --> 02:09:38,121
ASHLEY: I was going to say the Fiona too,

3097
02:09:38,121 --> 02:09:39,300
because Fiona's just--
TALIESIN: Fiona's really got to go.

3098
02:09:39,300 --> 02:09:40,370
MARISHA: Yeah, it's just a dumb name.

3099
02:09:40,370 --> 02:09:42,595
ASHLEY: Lame.
(laughter)

3100
02:09:42,595 --> 02:09:44,373
LAURA: It's not a terrible name, I like that name.

3101
02:09:44,373 --> 02:09:46,410
TRAVIS: For a ship, right?
MARISHA: Oh, right.

3102
02:09:46,410 --> 02:09:48,290
Not Fiona Fancypants.

3103
02:09:48,290 --> 02:09:53,290
That's not at all indicative of where I'm talking about.

3104
02:09:53,330 --> 02:09:54,680
Let's just start blowing up boats.

3105
02:09:54,680 --> 02:09:56,090
Why are we still talking?

3106
02:09:56,090 --> 02:10:00,110
SAM: Any of these good-looking vessels?

3107
02:10:00,110 --> 02:10:02,310
MATT: I mean, the Sea Banshee is fairly nice,

3108
02:10:02,310 --> 02:10:04,870
and has been taken care well.
MARISHA: Why are we still talking?

3109
02:10:04,870 --> 02:10:09,580
MATT: The Mistral also is a nice medium-sized,

3110
02:10:09,580 --> 02:10:12,670
looks like a naval vessel.

3111
02:10:12,670 --> 02:10:16,260
SAM: And which is the furthest from the Vokodo door?

3112
02:10:16,260 --> 02:10:20,000
MATT: The furthest from it would be the Fiona.

3113
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:21,010
LAURA: Oh.
TRAVIS: Perfect.

3114
02:10:21,010 --> 02:10:23,340
SAM: Fiona's got to go.
TALIESIN: Have some Guidance.

3115
02:10:23,340 --> 02:10:25,340
SAM: Oh, thank you.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3116
02:10:25,340 --> 02:10:26,173
SAM: All right.

3117
02:10:26,173 --> 02:10:29,200
I'd like to walk on water over to the Fiona

3118
02:10:29,200 --> 02:10:32,550
and attach my depth charge to it,

3119
02:10:32,550 --> 02:10:34,250
or just put it on the--

3120
02:10:34,250 --> 02:10:36,410
I don't know. Where should I put it, Fjord?

3121
02:10:36,410 --> 02:10:38,820
Where is going to make the thing burn and sink?

3122
02:10:40,090 --> 02:10:42,320
TRAVIS: Burn and sink? I don't know.

3123
02:10:42,320 --> 02:10:44,470
I haven't burned a lot of boats.

3124
02:10:44,470 --> 02:10:46,150
SAM: What do we want, fire or sink?

3125
02:10:47,190 --> 02:10:48,607
MARISHA: Fire.
TRAVIS: Fire, right?

3126
02:10:48,607 --> 02:10:50,960
MARISHA: Fire!
TRAVIS: If you went above decks

3127
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:52,090
and went down into the hull

3128
02:10:52,090 --> 02:10:53,450
and attached it right under the deck.

3129
02:10:53,450 --> 02:10:55,220
SAM: Great.
TRAVIS: That'll be a show.

3130
02:10:55,220 --> 02:10:56,053
SAM: I'll do that.

3131
02:10:56,053 --> 02:10:57,250
MATT: You go and attach it there below the deck.

3132
02:10:57,250 --> 02:10:59,390
SAM: And then, I mean,

3133
02:10:59,390 --> 02:11:01,100
I've got to light it on fire or something

3134
02:11:01,100 --> 02:11:02,740
so it'll explode.

3135
02:11:02,740 --> 02:11:04,120
MARISHA: How far back should we all be?

3136
02:11:04,120 --> 02:11:06,535
SAM: I don't know.
MARISHA: Okay.

3137
02:11:06,535 --> 02:11:08,200
SAM: Come with me, will you?

3138
02:11:08,200 --> 02:11:11,520
MARISHA: Gotta be close, make sure it works, yeah. (laughs)

3139
02:11:11,520 --> 02:11:12,600
SAM: All right.

3140
02:11:12,600 --> 02:11:15,560
I guess, shall we make some sort of fuse,

3141
02:11:15,560 --> 02:11:18,220
or just going to throw a Fireball at it?

3142
02:11:18,220 --> 02:11:20,090
LIAM: I could just lob this over here.

3143
02:11:20,090 --> 02:11:21,080
SAM: All right.
LIAM: Just a little bit.

3144
02:11:21,080 --> 02:11:22,390
SAM: Somewhere where we can run away.

3145
02:11:22,390 --> 02:11:23,530
SAM: This is not a Fireball.

3146
02:11:23,530 --> 02:11:27,580
This is just a globule of fire.

3147
02:11:27,580 --> 02:11:29,410
SAM: Sure, but it will explode,

3148
02:11:29,410 --> 02:11:31,150
so we just need to be far enough back.

3149
02:11:31,150 --> 02:11:34,970
LIAM: How far back?
SAM: Well, we're below decks?

3150
02:11:36,050 --> 02:11:38,010
TRAVIS: Are you going to set
it off while you're in the ship?

3151
02:11:38,010 --> 02:11:40,076
LIAM: No.
SAM: I mean, yes, I have no fuse.

3152
02:11:40,076 --> 02:11:42,050
TRAVIS: (laughing) Yes, no!
(laughter)

3153
02:11:42,050 --> 02:11:43,850
SAM: I have no fuse, so.

3154
02:11:43,850 --> 02:11:46,905
TRAVIS: You definitely don't want to be on or near the ship.

3155
02:11:49,204 --> 02:11:51,290
LIAM: I mean, the entire ship is made of wood.

3156
02:11:51,290 --> 02:11:53,340
We could just set the boat on fire.

3157
02:11:53,340 --> 02:11:54,755
SAM: Let's do that.

3158
02:11:54,755 --> 02:11:56,020
(laughter)

3159
02:11:56,020 --> 02:11:58,300
TRAVIS: Is it as loud as a depth charge?

3160
02:11:58,300 --> 02:11:59,200
SAM: We'll set the boat on fire,

3161
02:11:59,200 --> 02:12:00,530
but we'll leave the depth charge in,

3162
02:12:00,530 --> 02:12:02,990
and when the fire reaches it, kaboom!

3163
02:12:02,990 --> 02:12:03,970
LIAM: There you go.

3164
02:12:03,970 --> 02:12:05,511
TALIESIN: Working together!

3165
02:12:05,511 --> 02:12:07,550
TRAVIS: Starting to gel!

3166
02:12:07,550 --> 02:12:08,960
MARISHA: We have a great knowledge of demolition.

3167
02:12:08,960 --> 02:12:09,950
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

3168
02:12:09,950 --> 02:12:13,510
How do we run anything?
MARISHA: I don't know.

3169
02:12:14,616 --> 02:12:17,709
LIAM: That was like a 19-point three-point turn.

3170
02:12:17,709 --> 02:12:21,214
(car revving)
(laughter)

3171
02:12:21,214 --> 02:12:24,713
MATT: All right, so placing the charge onto the upper deck

3172
02:12:26,413 --> 02:12:28,860
of the deck, you all take a safe distance,

3173
02:12:28,860 --> 02:12:29,960
and then what do you do?

3174
02:12:31,300 --> 02:12:33,758
LIAM: I just start using Fire Bolt

3175
02:12:34,830 --> 02:12:37,810
to light this boat and maybe the one next to it on fire.

3176
02:12:37,810 --> 02:12:39,760
MATT: It is a cantrip, so you can do it indefinitely.

3177
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:40,870
It does take you a while,

3178
02:12:40,870 --> 02:12:42,520
because, one, it's a moist interior,

3179
02:12:42,520 --> 02:12:46,908
and looks like a lot of the wood here is somewhat--
LAURA: (giggles)

3180
02:12:46,908 --> 02:12:48,940
MATT: Goddamn it.

3181
02:12:48,940 --> 02:12:50,240
TALIESIN: Been all night. It's been all night.

3182
02:12:50,240 --> 02:12:52,800
There's no one else. Okay.

3183
02:12:52,800 --> 02:12:55,940
MATT: Missed you too, Laura.
(laughter)

3184
02:12:55,940 --> 02:12:58,345
So it takes you a while to get the wood--

3185
02:12:58,345 --> 02:13:00,231
(laughter)

3186
02:13:00,231 --> 02:13:02,193
LIAM: Tell me more about the wood.
MATT: You get the wood dry enough.

3187
02:13:02,193 --> 02:13:03,799
(laughter)

3188
02:13:03,799 --> 02:13:05,149
TRAVIS: Dry that wood.

3189
02:13:05,149 --> 02:13:06,965
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. Make it so dry for you.

3190
02:13:06,965 --> 02:13:11,730
(laughter, sounds of disgust)

3191
02:13:11,730 --> 02:13:15,280
LIAM: Actually, with Control Flames,
which is a cantrip I have,

3192
02:13:15,280 --> 02:13:19,140
I can, with one action, make five feet,

3193
02:13:19,140 --> 02:13:21,250
turn into another five feet, into another five feet.

3194
02:13:21,250 --> 02:13:22,083
So with that--
MATT: Yeah.

3195
02:13:22,083 --> 02:13:23,710
Once it catches, you can switch to that,

3196
02:13:23,710 --> 02:13:25,940
and as you do, the flames begin to spread

3197
02:13:25,940 --> 02:13:29,300
and engulf the exterior and upper deck area

3198
02:13:29,300 --> 02:13:31,670
of the Fiona.
LIAM: That's my cantrip.

3199
02:13:31,670 --> 02:13:32,930
MATT: As it begins to burn bright,

3200
02:13:32,930 --> 02:13:36,850
the interior of the cavern is now being warmly lit

3201
02:13:36,850 --> 02:13:39,380
in the immediate vicinity of the ship,

3202
02:13:39,380 --> 02:13:43,357
and you watch as the flames spread and spread and--

3203
02:13:45,184 --> 02:13:46,630
(explosion)
ALL: (gasping)

3204
02:13:46,630 --> 02:13:48,530
MATT: The detonation rocks the interior

3205
02:13:48,530 --> 02:13:52,720
and you watch as the deck sprays a splintering cloud

3206
02:13:52,720 --> 02:13:55,350
of shards of burning wood.

3207
02:13:55,350 --> 02:13:57,810
The mast--
(crumbling)

3208
02:13:57,810 --> 02:13:59,070
TRAVIS: Yeah!
MATT: Falls at the side,

3209
02:13:59,070 --> 02:14:03,600
now itself engulfed in flames, and the ship is...

3210
02:14:03,600 --> 02:14:06,590
It's a goner, and it's just now on fire,

3211
02:14:06,590 --> 02:14:07,423
and you can see, slowly,

3212
02:14:07,423 --> 02:14:10,580
it's beginning to capsize a bit to one side.

3213
02:14:10,580 --> 02:14:12,320
LIAM: I look over to Yasha and say:

3214
02:14:12,320 --> 02:14:16,610
Once you burn one ship, it's kind of hard to stop.

3215
02:14:16,610 --> 02:14:19,302
SAM: No, no!
(laughter)

3216
02:14:19,302 --> 02:14:23,582
MARISHA: Oh, yeah. Yeah. (laughs)

3217
02:14:23,582 --> 02:14:26,419
LIAM: (flame whooshing)
SAM: No, no!

3218
02:14:26,419 --> 02:14:27,686
TRAVIS: Tackle him!

3219
02:14:27,686 --> 02:14:28,910
(laughter)

3220
02:14:28,910 --> 02:14:30,140
SAM: We can all hide or something.

3221
02:14:30,140 --> 02:14:32,690
MATT: After a short time, you hear

3222
02:14:34,659 --> 02:14:36,210
(rock rumbling)

3223
02:14:36,210 --> 02:14:39,160
You feel a universal rumble.

3224
02:14:39,160 --> 02:14:43,740
You watch as certain small elements of rock and stone

3225
02:14:43,740 --> 02:14:46,100
begin to (splashing)
LAURA: Uh-oh.

3226
02:14:46,100 --> 02:14:48,590
MATT: -- from the inside.
MARISHA: Is this roof going to collapse?

3227
02:14:48,590 --> 02:14:50,711
LAURA: You put the roof on us?

3228
02:14:50,711 --> 02:14:51,730
Should we get in the bubble?

3229
02:14:51,730 --> 02:14:53,490
SAM: It's okay, it's fine, take cover.

3230
02:14:53,490 --> 02:14:54,470
LIAM: I've got a pearl on my head

3231
02:14:54,470 --> 02:14:56,730
and I'm starting to cast Fortune's Favor.

3232
02:14:56,730 --> 02:15:00,450
MATT: The rumbling begins to subside a bit

3233
02:15:00,450 --> 02:15:02,900
to just a low, continuous rumble.

3234
02:15:02,900 --> 02:15:06,208
(rumbling)

3235
02:15:06,208 --> 02:15:08,946
MARISHA: Does that mean he's coming?
TRAVIS: We spread out.

3236
02:15:08,946 --> 02:15:10,750
LAURA: I'm going to make sure I'm standing next to Beau,

3237
02:15:10,750 --> 02:15:12,870
and you should make sure you're standing next to Yasha.

3238
02:15:12,870 --> 02:15:14,250
TALIESIN: All right.
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

3239
02:15:14,250 --> 02:15:15,416
MATT: Okay.

3240
02:15:16,920 --> 02:15:18,936
ASHLEY: Wait, is the--
MATT: A few more moments pass.

3241
02:15:18,936 --> 02:15:21,308
What's up?
ASHLEY: No, no, it's okay.

3242
02:15:21,308 --> 02:15:23,370
MATT: A few moments pass. The rumbling continues.

3243
02:15:23,370 --> 02:15:26,112
The ship is now burning and slowly,

3244
02:15:26,112 --> 02:15:29,380
(bubbling)
it is sort of sinking,

3245
02:15:29,380 --> 02:15:30,980
and it's hitting the edge of the sand bank,

3246
02:15:30,980 --> 02:15:32,870
so it's sinking and beginning to tumble to the side

3247
02:15:32,870 --> 02:15:36,230
to find itself to a deeper portion of the cavern,

3248
02:15:36,230 --> 02:15:39,800
which now puts flames partially obscuring the exit

3249
02:15:39,800 --> 02:15:41,356
from where the--
SAM: Good.

3250
02:15:41,356 --> 02:15:44,320
MATT: (laughs) The waterfall is, but not entirely.

3251
02:15:44,320 --> 02:15:46,511
The rumbling continues.

3252
02:15:48,278 --> 02:15:50,219
It continues, unchanging.

3253
02:15:50,219 --> 02:15:51,820
LAURA: Uh.
MATT: It's a perpetual rumble.

3254
02:15:52,860 --> 02:15:56,200
TRAVIS: How's the temperature?
MATT: Of the chamber?

3255
02:15:56,200 --> 02:15:59,000
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: It's the same.

3256
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:00,910
MARISHA: Can I put my hand in the water?

3257
02:16:00,910 --> 02:16:01,743
MATT: Sure.

3258
02:16:01,743 --> 02:16:03,700
MARISHA: Does the water feel

3259
02:16:03,700 --> 02:16:06,025
the same temperature as before, or warmer?

3260
02:16:06,880 --> 02:16:08,980
MATT: Currently, the water feels same temperature.

3261
02:16:10,460 --> 02:16:11,758
LAURA: Can I try using...

3262
02:16:12,616 --> 02:16:14,457
I'm going to get down

3263
02:16:16,724 --> 02:16:19,057
and kneel down on the deck of

3264
02:16:19,057 --> 02:16:20,499
whatever boat we're on right now.

3265
02:16:20,499 --> 02:16:21,829
MATT: Okay.

3266
02:16:21,829 --> 02:16:23,980
LAURA: And I'm going to try use Divine Intervention.

3267
02:16:24,920 --> 02:16:25,753
MATT: Okay.

3268
02:16:25,753 --> 02:16:27,470
LAURA: To get the Traveler's attention here.

3269
02:16:27,470 --> 02:16:28,570
MATT: What are you trying to do?

3270
02:16:28,570 --> 02:16:30,420
What are you asking for with the Divine Intervention?

3271
02:16:30,420 --> 02:16:32,713
LAURA: I'm going to ask the Traveler

3272
02:16:37,623 --> 02:16:39,710
to help us get Vokodo out of his--

3273
02:16:39,710 --> 02:16:43,000
TRAVIS: To fuck him.
(laughter)

3274
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,740
LAURA: Get him here.
MATT: All right.

3275
02:16:45,740 --> 02:16:47,873
Go ahead and make a roll.

3276
02:16:47,873 --> 02:16:49,400
LAURA: Aw, I really shouldn't have said fuck him

3277
02:16:49,400 --> 02:16:50,770
when I was talking to the dragon turtle.

3278
02:16:50,770 --> 02:16:52,808
I really feel like I messed everything up with--

3279
02:16:52,808 --> 02:16:54,850
TRAVIS: You said fuck him!
(laughter)

3280
02:16:54,850 --> 02:16:57,308
LIAM: (as Jester) We are going to peg Vokodo.

3281
02:16:57,308 --> 02:17:01,898
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3282
02:17:01,898 --> 02:17:04,100
LAURA: (bitter laugh)
TRAVIS: Oh, what? Say yes.

3283
02:17:04,100 --> 02:17:06,890
LAURA: Oh, no, no. It's too high, it's too high.

3284
02:17:06,890 --> 02:17:09,300
It's close, but it's too high.
MATT: Curses.

3285
02:17:09,300 --> 02:17:12,180
As you reach out, the Traveler through your head,

3286
02:17:12,180 --> 02:17:15,290
you hear the voice go, "Really'd love to help.

3287
02:17:15,290 --> 02:17:16,123
"Currently dealing with

3288
02:17:16,123 --> 02:17:19,200
"some really shitty travel buddies at the moment.

3289
02:17:19,200 --> 02:17:21,650
"So sorry, but soon! (growls)"

3290
02:17:21,650 --> 02:17:23,320
You can hear the frustration in his voice,

3291
02:17:23,320 --> 02:17:25,995
not with you, but he seems to be preoccupied.

3292
02:17:27,090 --> 02:17:29,260
The rumbling continues.

3293
02:17:29,260 --> 02:17:34,260
Occasionally, it spikes.
(rumbling)

3294
02:17:35,005 --> 02:17:37,583
TRAVIS: Hmm.
MATT: (loud rumbling)

3295
02:17:37,583 --> 02:17:40,620
MARISHA: One of you guys that can do illusions and stuff.

3296
02:17:40,620 --> 02:17:43,310
Should you be like, "Oh, shit!

3297
02:17:43,310 --> 02:17:47,150
"They're destroying all the boats in Heaven's Falls, oh no!"

3298
02:17:47,150 --> 02:17:48,970
MATT: Vilya closes her eyes for a second,

3299
02:17:48,970 --> 02:17:51,570
and as she does, you see her face like...

3300
02:17:52,730 --> 02:17:55,440
very faint flames licking up the sides of her forearms.

3301
02:17:55,440 --> 02:17:57,860
SAM: Oh.
MATT: (rumbling)

3302
02:17:57,860 --> 02:18:00,760
She thinks. "I have a bad feeling, hold on."

3303
02:18:00,760 --> 02:18:05,150
And she transforms into a regular owl.

3304
02:18:05,150 --> 02:18:06,900
Not a large one, a regular one.

3305
02:18:06,900 --> 02:18:10,980
Coasts past the flames of the sinking ship, the Fiona,

3306
02:18:10,980 --> 02:18:15,480
and heads through the illusion to the side,

3307
02:18:15,480 --> 02:18:17,670
best she can, of the waterfall,

3308
02:18:17,670 --> 02:18:19,500
and vanishes out of sight.

3309
02:18:19,500 --> 02:18:20,813
MARISHA: Great. We're never going to see her again.

3310
02:18:20,813 --> 02:18:22,657
LIAM: She's gone to--
LAURA: Check it out.

3311
02:18:22,657 --> 02:18:25,095
LIAM: -- get an aerial.
TRAVIS: (imitating smoke)

3312
02:18:25,095 --> 02:18:26,890
LAURA: She just said it was a really bad idea

3313
02:18:26,890 --> 02:18:28,540
to go through that thing as a bird,

3314
02:18:28,540 --> 02:18:29,940
and then she did it.
MARISHA: Yeah.

3315
02:18:29,940 --> 02:18:31,777
LAURA: So it must be pretty serious.

3316
02:18:31,777 --> 02:18:33,110
(laughter)

3317
02:18:33,110 --> 02:18:35,303
MATT: Yeah. As a large bird, yes.

3318
02:18:36,270 --> 02:18:38,860
She comes back through from the other side a moment later

3319
02:18:38,860 --> 02:18:43,448
and lands, retransforms.

3320
02:18:43,448 --> 02:18:44,931
"Well, it's erupting."

3321
02:18:44,931 --> 02:18:46,690
(laughter)
MARISHA: Hmm, hmm.

3322
02:18:46,690 --> 02:18:48,980
MATT: And you feel another
(rumbling)

3323
02:18:48,980 --> 02:18:51,820
Rumble.
(laughter)

3324
02:18:53,078 --> 02:18:54,981
SAM: We suck at this game!
MATT: More stones are...

3325
02:18:54,981 --> 02:18:56,000
(splashes)

3326
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:57,760
LIAM: I'm hoping that Caleb has had enough time,

3327
02:18:57,760 --> 02:18:59,600
a minute, to cast Fortune's Favor.

3328
02:18:59,600 --> 02:19:02,030
MATT: Yes.
LIAM: I think it's time to go--

3329
02:19:02,030 --> 02:19:03,360
TRAVIS: In.
LIAM: Into the butthole.

3330
02:19:03,360 --> 02:19:05,290
TRAVIS: I agree.
LIAM: Immediately.

3331
02:19:05,290 --> 02:19:07,010
LAURA: We're not going to get him out of here?

3332
02:19:07,010 --> 02:19:08,420
TRAVIS: One thing.

3333
02:19:08,420 --> 02:19:09,253
If he's pissed

3334
02:19:09,253 --> 02:19:10,980
and that's what's causing the volcano to erupt,

3335
02:19:10,980 --> 02:19:13,120
the water will be boiling.

3336
02:19:13,120 --> 02:19:15,010
It's going to be very hot.
MARISHA: Yeah.

3337
02:19:15,010 --> 02:19:16,950
SAM: (high-pitched) So why are we going to go in, then?

3338
02:19:16,950 --> 02:19:19,833
TRAVIS: I think we forgot to talk about that part.

3339
02:19:19,833 --> 02:19:22,166
Remember he got mad and it started to get a little warm?

3340
02:19:22,166 --> 02:19:23,830
LAURA: Yeah, you remember?
MARISHA: Saving throws.

3341
02:19:23,830 --> 02:19:24,780
SAM: Are we going to lie?

3342
02:19:24,780 --> 02:19:27,052
Are we going to say, like, "Oh, it was crazy!

3343
02:19:27,052 --> 02:19:29,350
"It was crazy! Someone's destroying your ships!

3344
02:19:29,350 --> 02:19:30,183
"We tried to stop them!"

3345
02:19:30,183 --> 02:19:31,455
Or...
TRAVIS: We're going in,

3346
02:19:31,455 --> 02:19:33,250
and we've got five minutes--
LAURA: Or do we say fuck it,

3347
02:19:33,250 --> 02:19:36,100
and we try to keep destroying the ships,

3348
02:19:36,100 --> 02:19:37,470
and hope he'll come out?

3349
02:19:37,470 --> 02:19:39,310
TRAVIS: Blow another one up.
LAURA: Do one more.

3350
02:19:39,310 --> 02:19:41,790
MARISHA: How many boats are burning?
ASHLEY: Oh, man.

3351
02:19:41,790 --> 02:19:45,270
MARISHA: How many boats are on fire?
SAM: Just two. One?

3352
02:19:45,270 --> 02:19:46,670
MATT: Just the Fiona, that's it.

3353
02:19:47,740 --> 02:19:50,607
MARISHA: Maybe we should blow up more boats?

3354
02:19:50,607 --> 02:19:51,710
ASHLEY: I feel like he'd let them all burn.

3355
02:19:51,710 --> 02:19:54,490
SAM: This is a terrible idea!
LAURA: You think?

3356
02:19:54,490 --> 02:19:56,156
TRAVIS: I don't know. If people start smashing your shit,

3357
02:19:56,156 --> 02:19:58,430
and you've got 20 of something and they only break one,

3358
02:19:58,430 --> 02:20:00,426
you're like, "Eh, not so bad."
LAURA: "I'm pissed."

3359
02:20:00,426 --> 02:20:02,370
TRAVIS: Halfway through there, you're like, "Fuck it!"

3360
02:20:02,370 --> 02:20:04,890
Unlocking the door and coming out, right?

3361
02:20:04,890 --> 02:20:06,430
SAM: That's what I would do.
ASHLEY: Try it.

3362
02:20:06,430 --> 02:20:08,270
MATT: It's up to you guys. What are you going to do?

3363
02:20:08,270 --> 02:20:11,250
MARISHA: What if he's trapped in the volcano

3364
02:20:11,250 --> 02:20:14,280
and he can't come out no matter how hard he wants to?

3365
02:20:15,160 --> 02:20:17,000
TRAVIS: Wants to come out.
MARISHA: Hmm hmm.

3366
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:17,916
SAM: You could be right. It could be

3367
02:20:17,916 --> 02:20:19,450
safe for him in there or something.

3368
02:20:19,450 --> 02:20:20,283
I don't know.

3369
02:20:21,140 --> 02:20:22,690
TALIESIN: I think he's stuck in there.
MATT: What are you doing?

3370
02:20:22,690 --> 02:20:24,420
TRAVIS: You want to smoke another boat, or we going in?

3371
02:20:24,420 --> 02:20:26,230
LIAM: Caleb's already burning the next ship.

3372
02:20:26,230 --> 02:20:29,020
(laughter)

3373
02:20:29,020 --> 02:20:31,210
MATT: Which ship are you burning?
SAM: The Banshee.

3374
02:20:31,210 --> 02:20:32,480
LAURA: Whatever's next to the Fiona.

3375
02:20:32,480 --> 02:20:33,860
LIAM: Whatever's next to the Fiona.

3376
02:20:33,860 --> 02:20:34,830
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: Caleb's just like (groans).

3377
02:20:34,830 --> 02:20:35,663
MATT: That's right. (laughs)

3378
02:20:35,663 --> 02:20:38,570
You guys look over and just already just lobbing Fire Bolt.

3379
02:20:38,570 --> 02:20:41,230
TRAVIS: With straight hair sticking out. (groans)

3380
02:20:41,230 --> 02:20:42,270
TALIESIN: Okay, we're doing this.

3381
02:20:42,270 --> 02:20:45,570
MATT: This ship continues to burn slowly.

3382
02:20:45,570 --> 02:20:47,240
It takes about 10 minutes or so

3383
02:20:47,240 --> 02:20:50,570
for it to become a fair inferno.

3384
02:20:50,570 --> 02:20:51,660
The sails begin to catch,

3385
02:20:51,660 --> 02:20:52,760
and you watch as the Sea Banshee

3386
02:20:52,760 --> 02:20:55,670
becomes another burning ship.

3387
02:20:55,670 --> 02:20:58,380
It's going to take a little bit, but it is now on fire.

3388
02:20:58,380 --> 02:21:00,250
Are you going to leave that and move to another one?

3389
02:21:00,250 --> 02:21:01,842
What are you doing?

3390
02:21:03,100 --> 02:21:04,880
LIAM: I will until someone tells me different.

3391
02:21:04,880 --> 02:21:06,350
LAURA: No, no, no, no, no.

3392
02:21:06,350 --> 02:21:08,880
TRAVIS: Burn it. Keep going.
TALIESIN: Keeping Resistance up.

3393
02:21:08,880 --> 02:21:10,640
TRAVIS: We don't need these ships. He does.
MATT: Third ship or not?

3394
02:21:10,640 --> 02:21:12,930
LIAM: Has anything changed at all in the 10 minutes

3395
02:21:12,930 --> 02:21:15,850
that Caleb spent?
MATT: As it begins to burn,

3396
02:21:15,850 --> 02:21:18,630
you hear and feel another
(rumbling)

3397
02:21:18,630 --> 02:21:22,030
another heavy reverberance,

3398
02:21:22,030 --> 02:21:24,310
almost like an explosion from the outside,

3399
02:21:24,310 --> 02:21:25,900
and you all can feel and hear it

3400
02:21:25,900 --> 02:21:28,010
from the inside of this chamber.

3401
02:21:28,010 --> 02:21:30,530
TRAVIS: He's just like a uranium rod that's overreacting.

3402
02:21:30,530 --> 02:21:33,625
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: (roaring fire)

3403
02:21:33,625 --> 02:21:34,860
LAURA: Oh, god.
TRAVIS: We got to go.

3404
02:21:34,860 --> 02:21:36,668
We got to go in.
LAURA: We got to go in.

3405
02:21:36,668 --> 02:21:38,720
We're going to kill everybody.
TRAVIS: We're going to kill ourselves.

3406
02:21:38,720 --> 02:21:39,840
LAURA: If they're not already dead.
TRAVIS: But we got to go in.

3407
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:41,350
MARISHA: Yeah, we're sitting--

3408
02:21:41,350 --> 02:21:42,620
LAURA: We're going to die, you guys.

3409
02:21:42,620 --> 02:21:45,260
This could kill us all.
MATT: What are you doing?

3410
02:21:45,260 --> 02:21:48,637
TRAVIS: You know, we don't have to go in. (laughs)

3411
02:21:48,637 --> 02:21:50,670
We could just go outside and wait.

3412
02:21:50,670 --> 02:21:52,560
SAM: We could just leave everyone here to die. (laughs)

3413
02:21:52,560 --> 02:21:54,670
TRAVIS: Yeah, Vilya can step through a tree,

3414
02:21:54,670 --> 02:21:56,030
take us to another continent.

3415
02:21:56,030 --> 02:21:57,900
MATT: The second ship is now beginning to sink

3416
02:21:57,900 --> 02:21:59,220
as you guys are waiting.

3417
02:21:59,220 --> 02:22:01,270
Rumbling continuing. What are you doing?

3418
02:22:01,270 --> 02:22:02,263
TRAVIS: We're going in, right?

3419
02:22:02,263 --> 02:22:03,605
MARISHA: Vilya.

3420
02:22:04,780 --> 02:22:07,422
Have you ever wanted to go to Wildemount?

3421
02:22:09,010 --> 02:22:10,691
LAURA: We should go in.
MATT: "Not particularly."

3422
02:22:10,691 --> 02:22:13,240
MARISHA: (sighs) Okay, we should go in.
LAURA: We have to save everyone.

3423
02:22:13,240 --> 02:22:14,183
MARISHA: Okay.

3424
02:22:14,183 --> 02:22:17,083
TRAVIS: Everybody on a rope?
SAM: We go in?

3425
02:22:17,083 --> 02:22:18,220
TRAVIS: Let's jump into the water.

3426
02:22:18,220 --> 02:22:20,320
MATT: You guys are going in?
TRAVIS: Yes, yes?

3427
02:22:20,320 --> 02:22:21,610
ASHLEY: Yes.
TRAVIS: Yes?

3428
02:22:21,610 --> 02:22:23,010
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Thumbs up?

3429
02:22:23,010 --> 02:22:25,790
MARISHA: Yes!
TRAVIS: Form Voltron.

3430
02:22:25,790 --> 02:22:27,050
Get your thumb up!
MARISHA: No, come on, Veth!

3431
02:22:27,050 --> 02:22:29,150
TRAVIS: Get your thumb up, Veth!
LAURA: How long did we say

3432
02:22:29,150 --> 02:22:30,670
it took to get through the tunnels?

3433
02:22:30,670 --> 02:22:32,722
MARISHA: An hour.
MATT: From the other side,

3434
02:22:32,722 --> 02:22:34,090
it was about an hour, yeah.
LAURA: Jesus, okay.

3435
02:22:34,090 --> 02:22:35,340
SAM: From the other side.

3436
02:22:35,340 --> 02:22:36,380
This side, we don't know how long it takes.

3437
02:22:36,380 --> 02:22:37,490
MATT: You don't know long it will take from this side.

3438
02:22:37,490 --> 02:22:38,550
SAM: It could be less.

3439
02:22:38,550 --> 02:22:39,570
TRAVIS: We don't even know where this goes.

3440
02:22:39,570 --> 02:22:41,620
LAURA: I'm going to be behind Beau

3441
02:22:41,620 --> 02:22:44,270
and I'm just going to be ready to,

3442
02:22:44,270 --> 02:22:47,628
as soon as I see the opening into the cavern,

3443
02:22:47,628 --> 02:22:50,500
hit her and cast Freedom of Movement.

3444
02:22:50,500 --> 02:22:52,166
MATT: You've got it.
TRAVIS: I'm a super-fast swimmer too, like him.

3445
02:22:52,166 --> 02:22:54,293
SAM: Are we all tied together still?

3446
02:22:54,293 --> 02:22:55,360
LAURA: We're all holding onto the rope,

3447
02:22:55,360 --> 02:22:56,640
but it didn't matter the last time.

3448
02:22:56,640 --> 02:22:59,380
TALIESIN: Actually, if you get there, you undo it, yeah.

3449
02:22:59,380 --> 02:23:01,540
MATT: All right. So you guys all dive into the water.

3450
02:23:01,540 --> 02:23:02,637
TRAVIS: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Oh, boy.

3451
02:23:02,637 --> 02:23:03,890
SAM: Fuck!
LIAM: Terrible.

3452
02:23:03,890 --> 02:23:05,810
TRAVIS: Feels great.
MATT: (splashes)

3453
02:23:05,810 --> 02:23:06,950
You all dive in.

3454
02:23:06,950 --> 02:23:09,220
Vilya uncomfortably dives in with you.

3455
02:23:09,220 --> 02:23:11,617
The water is warmer.
SAM: Sure.

3456
02:23:11,617 --> 02:23:13,060
MARISHA: Oh, so it's gotten warmer.
MATT: It's gotten warmer.

3457
02:23:13,060 --> 02:23:14,868
MARISHA: -- since I checked.
MATT: And as opposed to

3458
02:23:14,868 --> 02:23:15,951
when you first touched it,

3459
02:23:15,951 --> 02:23:19,800
the cold ocean temperature is now

3460
02:23:21,576 --> 02:23:24,910
a lukewarm, a little above room temperature warmth.

3461
02:23:24,910 --> 02:23:26,640
It's like a comfortable bath.

3462
02:23:26,640 --> 02:23:28,580
LIAM: That's just because we nervously peed in it, though.

3463
02:23:28,580 --> 02:23:30,480
MATT: Well, there's that too.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3464
02:23:30,480 --> 02:23:33,830
MATT: So what is the marching order for this entering?

3465
02:23:33,830 --> 02:23:37,020
LAURA: We're going to burn alive the minute we get in there.

3466
02:23:37,020 --> 02:23:38,717
MARISHA: Fjord is going to lead us.

3467
02:23:38,717 --> 02:23:40,330
MATT: Fjord is leading. Who's after Fjord?

3468
02:23:40,330 --> 02:23:41,810
TRAVIS: Beau.
MARISHA: I'll be after, yeah.

3469
02:23:41,810 --> 02:23:43,420
TRAVIS: It's Jester.
MATT: All right.

3470
02:23:43,420 --> 02:23:47,250
LAURA: Can't we just, like...
MARISHA: And then Yasha and Caduceus.

3471
02:23:47,250 --> 02:23:49,920
MATT: Wait, Yasha's after there?
MARISHA: After Beau.

3472
02:23:49,920 --> 02:23:52,050
MATT: And then it's Yasha, and then Caduceus.

3473
02:23:52,050 --> 02:23:54,638
MARISHA: Uh-huh.
MATT: All righty. And then?

3474
02:23:56,520 --> 02:23:58,714
SAM: Me, I guess. Us.
LIAM: Sure, yeah, no.

3475
02:23:58,714 --> 02:23:59,547
(laughter)
Don't put me last.

3476
02:23:59,547 --> 02:24:01,810
Don't put me last. I'll go behind the firbolg.

3477
02:24:01,810 --> 02:24:04,310
MATT: Vilya will go last.
SAM: I'll go last.

3478
02:24:04,310 --> 02:24:05,150
MATT: All right.

3479
02:24:05,150 --> 02:24:07,450
So you swim down and you can see

3480
02:24:07,450 --> 02:24:11,030
the glowing orange entrance of the torchbloom plants

3481
02:24:11,030 --> 02:24:14,060
that represent the beginning of this.

3482
02:24:14,060 --> 02:24:14,910
Fjord, as you get there,

3483
02:24:14,910 --> 02:24:15,743
I need you to go ahead

3484
02:24:15,743 --> 02:24:17,582
and make a wisdom saving throw for me with advantage.

3485
02:24:17,582 --> 02:24:22,210
TRAVIS: Yeah. With advantage.

3486
02:24:24,840 --> 02:24:26,165
14.

3487
02:24:28,490 --> 02:24:32,260
MATT: 14.
MARISHA: (laughs)

3488
02:24:33,470 --> 02:24:36,470
MATT: As you approach, you see it,

3489
02:24:36,470 --> 02:24:37,830
and you begin to get in front of the tunnel,

3490
02:24:37,830 --> 02:24:40,820
and you get there and go, "Okay.

3491
02:24:40,820 --> 02:24:42,150
"Okay, I know where it is. I know where it is.

3492
02:24:42,150 --> 02:24:43,650
"I got to get there, I got to get there."

3493
02:24:43,650 --> 02:24:44,910
And you take off.

3494
02:24:44,910 --> 02:24:46,000
LAURA: So, he's holding the rope,

3495
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:47,590
so all of us just start--
MATT: All of you guys...

3496
02:24:47,590 --> 02:24:49,507
Well, no, you're already swimming fast,

3497
02:24:49,507 --> 02:24:51,710
but you now swim with purpose,

3498
02:24:51,710 --> 02:24:54,820
and something is guiding you the right path now.

3499
02:24:54,820 --> 02:24:57,470
TRAVIS: I know where to go.
MATT: One after the next.

3500
02:24:57,470 --> 02:24:58,380
MARISHA: He's got the bug.

3501
02:24:58,380 --> 02:25:00,350
MATT: Could everybody roll a wisdom saving throw for me

3502
02:25:00,350 --> 02:25:03,100
with advantage, please?

3503
02:25:07,980 --> 02:25:08,960
MATT: Jester.

3504
02:25:08,960 --> 02:25:10,100
LAURA: 24.
MATT: 24.

3505
02:25:10,100 --> 02:25:12,015
LIAM: 22.
SAM: 19.

3506
02:25:12,015 --> 02:25:13,780
ASHLEY: 18.
TALIESIN: 24.

3507
02:25:13,780 --> 02:25:15,527
MARISHA: 16.
MATT: 16.

3508
02:25:16,380 --> 02:25:18,850
Everyone but Beauregard

3509
02:25:18,850 --> 02:25:22,770
is able to hold onto their mental state,

3510
02:25:22,770 --> 02:25:26,040
but Beauregard, you also find yourself pushed forward.

3511
02:25:26,040 --> 02:25:27,002
Now, you're all single file, so--

3512
02:25:27,002 --> 02:25:30,280
MARISHA: Yeah, captain! Let's go!
TRAVIS: Yeah!

3513
02:25:30,280 --> 02:25:34,020
MATT: So, the two of you are just
rushing through the tunnels,

3514
02:25:34,020 --> 02:25:35,480
so you can see where it branches off.

3515
02:25:35,480 --> 02:25:38,810
Initially, one splinter and then three,

3516
02:25:38,810 --> 02:25:41,280
and then it just becomes like numerous tunnels

3517
02:25:41,280 --> 02:25:42,290
that splinter off,

3518
02:25:42,290 --> 02:25:45,310
these lava tubes that are within the water.

3519
02:25:45,310 --> 02:25:47,380
But the two people that are leading it

3520
02:25:47,380 --> 02:25:48,860
seem to know where they're going.

3521
02:25:48,860 --> 02:25:50,380
LAURA: Great.
MATT: And following their lead,

3522
02:25:50,380 --> 02:25:55,213
you rush through for five,

3523
02:25:55,213 --> 02:25:58,675
10, 15,

3524
02:25:58,675 --> 02:25:59,800
20 minutes.

3525
02:25:59,800 --> 02:26:03,360
The water getting slightly warmer as you progress.

3526
02:26:03,360 --> 02:26:05,780
Not uncomfortable, but warmer.

3527
02:26:05,780 --> 02:26:07,330
You're now getting to that, like...

3528
02:26:08,420 --> 02:26:11,220
Almost to a hot shower-type temperature,

3529
02:26:11,220 --> 02:26:14,800
where it's prickly, but it's tolerable.

3530
02:26:16,440 --> 02:26:20,120
Roughly 35 minutes of rapid swimming,

3531
02:26:20,120 --> 02:26:22,620
which the rest of you are starting feeling really nervous.

3532
02:26:22,620 --> 02:26:24,420
The only light that's present here,

3533
02:26:24,420 --> 02:26:25,950
because they have night vision,

3534
02:26:25,950 --> 02:26:27,320
you can't see down here, Caleb,

3535
02:26:27,320 --> 02:26:29,410
so you're going to have to keep some lights up with you

3536
02:26:29,410 --> 02:26:30,660
if you want to be able to follow.

3537
02:26:30,660 --> 02:26:32,690
LIAM: But at the moment I'm roped, right?

3538
02:26:32,690 --> 02:26:35,560
MATT: Yeah. So are you just letting the rope take you?

3539
02:26:35,560 --> 02:26:38,440
LIAM: For now, yeah.
MATT: Okay.

3540
02:26:38,440 --> 02:26:40,530
I need you, Caleb, to go ahead

3541
02:26:40,530 --> 02:26:42,140
and make a dexterity saving throw for me.

3542
02:26:42,140 --> 02:26:43,900
LIAM: Okay.

3543
02:26:43,900 --> 02:26:46,290
LAURA: Would the fire flowers give off

3544
02:26:46,290 --> 02:26:49,200
any kind of glow?
MATT: Actually, no.

3545
02:26:49,200 --> 02:26:51,280
The torchbloom does give off a little bit of light.

3546
02:26:51,280 --> 02:26:52,520
LIAM: I thought.
MATT: So yes.

3547
02:26:52,520 --> 02:26:54,440
You are totally right.

3548
02:26:54,440 --> 02:26:55,780
So what'd you roll?
LIAM: I got a 20!

3549
02:26:55,780 --> 02:26:56,850
MATT: A 20. All right.

3550
02:26:56,850 --> 02:26:58,320
So, even letting the rope take you,

3551
02:26:58,320 --> 02:26:59,950
you push away at times to keep yourself

3552
02:26:59,950 --> 02:27:04,520
from colliding with the sides of the tunnel, the orange...

3553
02:27:04,520 --> 02:27:09,504
It feels like an odd similarity to...

3554
02:27:11,630 --> 02:27:15,700
My brain keeps going to the other side in Poltergeist,

3555
02:27:15,700 --> 02:27:17,540
how you're just this continuous tunnels

3556
02:27:17,540 --> 02:27:19,730
that just continue to shift and change,

3557
02:27:19,730 --> 02:27:21,400
and they move with the water,

3558
02:27:21,400 --> 02:27:24,230
as the torchbloom shifts with the swimming

3559
02:27:24,230 --> 02:27:27,380
and the separation of the liquid

3560
02:27:27,380 --> 02:27:30,340
you guys are swimming through.

3561
02:27:30,340 --> 02:27:33,890
Eventually, you see it begins to widen,

3562
02:27:33,890 --> 02:27:36,290
as both Fjord and Beauregard make your way

3563
02:27:36,290 --> 02:27:38,597
towards what looks to be

3564
02:27:38,597 --> 02:27:42,238
a familiar but different

3565
02:27:42,238 --> 02:27:45,146
opening into a chamber.

3566
02:27:46,500 --> 02:27:47,918
LAURA: Oh, as soon as I see the opening--

3567
02:27:47,918 --> 02:27:50,190
(splutters) I cast Freedom of Movement on Beau.

3568
02:27:50,190 --> 02:27:52,050
MATT: Okay, Beauregard, you have Freedom of Movement.

3569
02:27:52,050 --> 02:27:53,250
MARISHA: Dope.

3570
02:27:53,250 --> 02:27:54,570
MATT: Anybody else do anything before you get to him?

3571
02:27:54,570 --> 02:27:56,144
LIAM: Mirror Image.
LAURA: Freedom of Movement on Yasha.

3572
02:27:56,144 --> 02:27:57,720
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3573
02:27:57,720 --> 02:27:59,940
MATT: Okay.
SAM: I'll throw up Mage Hand.

3574
02:27:59,940 --> 02:28:01,580
MATT: Sure.
LIAM: I'm casting Mirror Image.

3575
02:28:01,580 --> 02:28:03,140
MATT: Mirror Image on yourself, all right.

3576
02:28:03,140 --> 02:28:05,030
Anything else?

3577
02:28:05,030 --> 02:28:05,863
Okay.

3578
02:28:05,863 --> 02:28:08,130
LAURA: Can I do something else?

3579
02:28:08,130 --> 02:28:09,498
Or since I cast Freedom of Movement,

3580
02:28:09,498 --> 02:28:10,840
is that my only thing I can do?

3581
02:28:10,840 --> 02:28:12,715
MATT: As you're approaching...

3582
02:28:14,073 --> 02:28:15,100
They begin to slow down

3583
02:28:15,100 --> 02:28:16,200
as they get to the edge point.

3584
02:28:16,200 --> 02:28:19,103
You can do it if you want to keep it subtle.

3585
02:28:20,360 --> 02:28:21,390
LAURA: Right before we go through,

3586
02:28:21,390 --> 02:28:24,080
I wanted to Invoke Duplicity.

3587
02:28:24,080 --> 02:28:26,060
MATT: Okay, yeah, that's easy enough.

3588
02:28:26,060 --> 02:28:26,893
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: You can do it.

3589
02:28:26,893 --> 02:28:30,855
Okay. So Duplicity has been Invoked.

3590
02:28:32,210 --> 02:28:35,730
SAM: This plan cannot fail.
MARISHA: Oh my god.

3591
02:28:35,730 --> 02:28:36,930
SAM: We have the element of surprise...

3592
02:28:36,930 --> 02:28:39,020
LAURA: We got to go fast.
SAM: What are we doing?

3593
02:28:39,020 --> 02:28:41,430
LAURA: Just go in and attack.
SAM: We're just (exclaiming)?

3594
02:28:41,430 --> 02:28:44,522
MARISHA: This feels like the most we've planned

3595
02:28:44,522 --> 02:28:46,390
and the least we've planned

3596
02:28:46,390 --> 02:28:47,980
all at the same time.

3597
02:28:47,980 --> 02:28:51,400
LAURA: Literally, I think we go in immediately and attack,

3598
02:28:51,400 --> 02:28:53,090
the minute we go through the door.

3599
02:28:53,090 --> 02:28:54,750
MATT: As you guys enter the chamber--

3600
02:28:54,750 --> 02:28:55,830
SAM: What could go wrong?

3601
02:28:55,830 --> 02:28:58,905
MATT: -- there are still those pockets of torchbloom

3602
02:28:59,820 --> 02:29:01,500
that give off a little bit of light throughout the chamber,

3603
02:29:01,500 --> 02:29:03,780
but it's still a heavily shaded space.

3604
02:29:03,780 --> 02:29:06,380
You see the familiar stalactites

3605
02:29:06,380 --> 02:29:07,650
that curl down from the ceiling.

3606
02:29:07,650 --> 02:29:09,990
This, you're pretty sure, is the exact chamber

3607
02:29:09,990 --> 02:29:12,140
where you first encountered Vokodo,

3608
02:29:12,140 --> 02:29:14,100
just from a different perspective.

3609
02:29:14,100 --> 02:29:16,675
You found an entrance from another side.

3610
02:29:17,700 --> 02:29:20,340
The temperature in here is quite hot.

3611
02:29:20,340 --> 02:29:21,530
The water itself,

3612
02:29:21,530 --> 02:29:25,660
it's beginning to numb the skin a little bit in places

3613
02:29:25,660 --> 02:29:28,093
with the volume of heat that's within.

3614
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,533
MARISHA: Any sign of Vokodo?

3615
02:29:32,533 --> 02:29:34,616
MATT: Make a perception check.

3616
02:29:34,616 --> 02:29:36,470
TALIESIN: I'll join in that.
MARISHA: Maybe he's busy,

3617
02:29:36,470 --> 02:29:39,600
operating the volcano.
SAM: Yeah, the levers and stuff.

3618
02:29:39,600 --> 02:29:41,130
MARISHA: Yeah, exactly.
TRAVIS: He's the wizard.

3619
02:29:41,130 --> 02:29:43,130
MARISHA: Yeah!

3620
02:29:43,130 --> 02:29:46,273
Okay, 18?
TALIESIN: 17. Hmm.

3621
02:29:46,273 --> 02:29:48,681
MATT: Okay. You glance up and catch the first sight

3622
02:29:48,681 --> 02:29:51,100
as in the ceiling portion

3623
02:29:51,100 --> 02:29:53,360
where he was first spotted when you came through,

3624
02:29:53,360 --> 02:29:57,030
you see these burning red orbs,

3625
02:29:57,030 --> 02:30:00,050
these angry eyes, four of them,

3626
02:30:00,050 --> 02:30:02,639
looking back in your direction, as tendrils

3627
02:30:02,639 --> 02:30:03,670
(whooshing, crunching)

3628
02:30:03,670 --> 02:30:04,950
and it pulls its way down

3629
02:30:04,950 --> 02:30:08,720
like some sort of massive coal-colored cephalopod.

3630
02:30:08,720 --> 02:30:09,870
TRAVIS: Cool, cool.

3631
02:30:11,596 --> 02:30:16,596
MATT: (as Vokodo) "What have you done?"

3632
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:18,686
And as he yells, the whole chamber--

3633
02:30:18,686 --> 02:30:21,210
(rumbling)
quakes angrily.

3634
02:30:23,110 --> 02:30:25,920
LAURA: Guiding Bolt.
MARISHA: Yeah!

3635
02:30:25,920 --> 02:30:27,704
MATT: Well, we're going to go ahead and take a break.

3636
02:30:27,704 --> 02:30:30,220
(laughter)

3637
02:30:30,220 --> 02:30:33,560
And jump back into this beforehand,

3638
02:30:33,560 --> 02:30:36,273
but as part of that, let me go ahead and set the battle map.

3639
02:30:36,273 --> 02:30:37,470
(clamoring)
ASHLEY: Oh, boy.

3640
02:30:37,470 --> 02:30:42,470
SAM: This impending TPK is brought to you by Dwarven Forge.

3641
02:30:42,716 --> 02:30:44,690
The journey out into the Wildlands,

3642
02:30:44,690 --> 02:30:46,970
Dwarven Forge's eighth terrain Kickstarter,

3643
02:30:46,970 --> 02:30:48,370
launches this weekend.

3644
02:30:48,370 --> 02:30:52,288
Check it out at DwarvenForge.com/Wildlands.

3645
02:30:52,288 --> 02:30:57,288
(clamoring)

3646
02:30:57,803 --> 02:31:00,240
MARISHA: Sometimes I see him buying pretty things,

3647
02:31:00,240 --> 02:31:02,855
and then I learn later that they're to destroy us.

3648
02:31:02,855 --> 02:31:04,040
MATT: (laughs)
ASHLEY: That is beautiful!

3649
02:31:04,040 --> 02:31:05,990
TRAVIS: Oh, it's for all the fish you don't have.

3650
02:31:05,990 --> 02:31:08,320
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah!

3651
02:31:08,320 --> 02:31:10,500
SAM: Any time you see an aquarium receipt

3652
02:31:10,500 --> 02:31:12,754
on your credit card bill, please text us.

3653
02:31:12,754 --> 02:31:15,504
(laughter)

3654
02:31:16,865 --> 02:31:18,360
TRAVIS: We've got a early warning system!

3655
02:31:18,360 --> 02:31:20,540
MARISHA: I will!
LAURA: There we go.

3656
02:31:20,540 --> 02:31:23,020
SAM: Pet store? No, no, something's wrong!

3657
02:31:23,020 --> 02:31:24,960
ASHLEY: Look at this!
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

3658
02:31:24,960 --> 02:31:27,468
LAURA: Wow!
ASHLEY: That is so cool!

3659
02:31:27,468 --> 02:31:28,520
SAM: Whoa.

3660
02:31:28,520 --> 02:31:31,120
MATT: Have essentially entered from this side.

3661
02:31:31,120 --> 02:31:33,950
SAM: The element of surprise.
MATT: Exactly.

3662
02:31:33,950 --> 02:31:35,970
LIAM: I mean, we've been doing Guiding Bolt up the butt

3663
02:31:35,970 --> 02:31:37,670
since campaign one, so--
MARISHA: It's appropriate.

3664
02:31:37,670 --> 02:31:38,503
LAURA: Right?

3665
02:31:39,524 --> 02:31:40,357
MATT: So you guys can tell me

3666
02:31:40,357 --> 02:31:42,370
where you would like to be distributed at this point

3667
02:31:42,370 --> 02:31:43,280
as you enter the chamber.

3668
02:31:43,280 --> 02:31:47,054
LIAM: Outside the volcano on Vo.

3669
02:31:47,054 --> 02:31:48,100
TALIESIN: Rumblecusp.
MATT: Loosely in this space,

3670
02:31:48,100 --> 02:31:51,120
because that's as far as you've gotten there.

3671
02:31:51,120 --> 02:31:52,890
LAURA: Fjord and Beau are the first ones out,

3672
02:31:52,890 --> 02:31:54,380
so you guys could get the farthest,

3673
02:31:54,380 --> 02:31:55,320
or wherever you'd want to be,

3674
02:31:55,320 --> 02:31:57,090
and he is, what, directly above us?

3675
02:31:57,090 --> 02:32:00,540
MARISHA: Yeah, where is he?
MATT: He is up here.

3676
02:32:00,540 --> 02:32:04,430
Like, just emerging from the upper portions of the chamber

3677
02:32:04,430 --> 02:32:06,410
and swimming--
MARISHA: How far can we get?

3678
02:32:07,290 --> 02:32:08,640
MATT: Right now, to where we start,

3679
02:32:08,640 --> 02:32:10,690
is about this inch of space here.

3680
02:32:10,690 --> 02:32:13,270
Just tell me where in that space you want to be.

3681
02:32:13,270 --> 02:32:16,210
MARISHA: I'll try and, uh...

3682
02:32:18,200 --> 02:32:21,130
Gosh. Can I even try and get up here, or?

3683
02:32:21,130 --> 02:32:22,570
TALIESIN: You have Freedom of Movement from her.

3684
02:32:22,570 --> 02:32:23,403
LAURA: Yeah.

3685
02:32:23,403 --> 02:32:26,160
MATT: You do, but for the purposes of this,

3686
02:32:26,160 --> 02:32:28,240
this is just arriving,

3687
02:32:28,240 --> 02:32:29,570
and this is happening here, so...

3688
02:32:29,570 --> 02:32:32,210
SAM: I'll hook right with Caleb, if you're up for it.

3689
02:32:32,210 --> 02:32:34,790
LIAM: Yeah, yeah. To get behind that column, yeah.

3690
02:32:34,790 --> 02:32:35,623
SAM: That thing.

3691
02:32:35,623 --> 02:32:36,820
MATT: Okay, that's as far as you guys can get

3692
02:32:36,820 --> 02:32:38,312
from stepping into the chamber.

3693
02:32:38,312 --> 02:32:39,530
MARISHA: Oh, you guys are behind?

3694
02:32:39,530 --> 02:32:41,410
Okay, then actually, put me opposite.

3695
02:32:41,410 --> 02:32:44,210
Put me on this wall over here, Matt, yeah.

3696
02:32:44,210 --> 02:32:45,490
MATT: That's about as far as you can get

3697
02:32:45,490 --> 02:32:46,880
from the entrance there.
MARISHA: That's great.

3698
02:32:46,880 --> 02:32:48,960
MATT: Best to scatter. Caduceus?

3699
02:32:48,960 --> 02:32:49,930
TALIESIN: I guess I'm just--

3700
02:32:49,930 --> 02:32:51,320
Yeah, or right to the left

3701
02:32:51,320 --> 02:32:53,740
so I have a partial cover from the column.

3702
02:32:53,740 --> 02:32:55,340
MATT: Over here?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3703
02:32:55,340 --> 02:32:57,730
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Yeah, I got a plan.

3704
02:32:57,730 --> 02:32:59,680
MATT: Vilya's going to come right here. Yasha?

3705
02:33:02,300 --> 02:33:04,520
TRAVIS: Where is Vokodo, ish?
LAURA: Above us.

3706
02:33:04,520 --> 02:33:06,250
MATT: Up here.
TRAVIS: Oh, cool, yeah.

3707
02:33:06,250 --> 02:33:11,020
ASHLEY: Yeah, let me go to the other side of Jester.

3708
02:33:12,030 --> 02:33:14,281
SAM: How could we have fucked this up this badly?

3709
02:33:14,281 --> 02:33:15,714
LIAM: So much planning--
MATT: Over here?

3710
02:33:15,714 --> 02:33:17,227
ASHLEY: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
LIAM: -- and debating and discussion.

3711
02:33:17,227 --> 02:33:18,430
LAURA: And then we just ran in.

3712
02:33:18,430 --> 02:33:20,940
LIAM: We just walked in and done the same thing.

3713
02:33:20,940 --> 02:33:22,552
MARISHA: Well...
MATT: Now, remember.

3714
02:33:22,552 --> 02:33:24,010
MARISHA: It was a good plan.
MATT: You are swimming,

3715
02:33:24,010 --> 02:33:25,710
so you can go--
LAURA: Up and down.

3716
02:33:25,710 --> 02:33:28,580
MATT: Up and down. There's upward, vertical travel in this.

3717
02:33:28,580 --> 02:33:30,560
TRAVIS: How tall is the cavern?
MATT: The cavern

3718
02:33:30,560 --> 02:33:33,040
up here is roughly 80 feet.
TRAVIS: 80 feet.

3719
02:33:33,040 --> 02:33:34,100
SAM: And is it all water

3720
02:33:34,100 --> 02:33:35,330
to the top, no?

3721
02:33:35,330 --> 02:33:36,750
MATT: You haven't swam all the way up there,

3722
02:33:36,750 --> 02:33:38,400
but from what you can currently see

3723
02:33:38,400 --> 02:33:40,770
it seems like it might be.
SAM: Oh shit.

3724
02:33:40,770 --> 02:33:42,180
ASHLEY: My god.
TRAVIS: You just peek your head out

3725
02:33:42,180 --> 02:33:43,615
and it's just magma.

3726
02:33:43,615 --> 02:33:45,073
(burning and screaming)

3727
02:33:45,073 --> 02:33:46,790
(laughter)

3728
02:33:46,790 --> 02:33:48,780
LIAM: There's this much oxygen.

3729
02:33:48,780 --> 02:33:50,180
TALIESIN: We can swim in here?
MATT: Yes, you can.

3730
02:33:50,180 --> 02:33:51,620
TALIESIN: We can go up?
MATT: Yep.

3731
02:33:51,620 --> 02:33:54,586
But those of you that do not have Freedom of Movement,

3732
02:33:54,586 --> 02:33:57,870
or have a swim enchantment, like you do,

3733
02:33:57,870 --> 02:33:59,440
it's half movement

3734
02:33:59,440 --> 02:34:02,920
and all attack rolls made with weapons are at disadvantage.

3735
02:34:02,920 --> 02:34:05,030
SAM: Oof.
MATT: So just be aware.

3736
02:34:05,030 --> 02:34:07,640
LAURA: But Freedom of Movement, that is not the case?

3737
02:34:07,640 --> 02:34:09,810
MATT: Correct. So you guys don't have to worry about that.

3738
02:34:09,810 --> 02:34:11,770
Spells don't have to worry about it.

3739
02:34:11,770 --> 02:34:15,100
Ranged weapons have their own unique little weird thing.

3740
02:34:15,100 --> 02:34:16,062
SAM: Sure.

3741
02:34:16,062 --> 02:34:18,320
Like, if I fire from cover,

3742
02:34:19,220 --> 02:34:20,840
which would normally be advantage,

3743
02:34:20,840 --> 02:34:22,040
this would be at disadvantage,

3744
02:34:22,040 --> 02:34:24,930
so it would just be a straight roll?

3745
02:34:24,930 --> 02:34:26,630
MATT: Specifically on this, let me get the rules,

3746
02:34:26,630 --> 02:34:28,010
because this will definitely impact

3747
02:34:28,010 --> 02:34:30,790
how you deal with this particular battle.

3748
02:34:31,663 --> 02:34:34,530
(pages flipping)

3749
02:34:34,530 --> 02:34:36,740
MARISHA: The D-Turt idea was very great.

3750
02:34:36,740 --> 02:34:37,630
MATT: It was really great.

3751
02:34:37,630 --> 02:34:39,195
I really wanted it to work out, I'm so sorry.

3752
02:34:39,195 --> 02:34:41,030
TRAVIS: 20 DC, huh?
MATT: 20 DC, yeah.

3753
02:34:41,030 --> 02:34:43,870
LIAM: Kaiju fight?
MARISHA: It would've been great.

3754
02:34:43,870 --> 02:34:44,930
MATT: Here we go.

3755
02:34:44,930 --> 02:34:46,420
"Ranged weapon automatically misses

3756
02:34:46,420 --> 02:34:49,090
"if it's beyond the weapon's normal range."

3757
02:34:49,090 --> 02:34:50,450
SAM: I have good range.

3758
02:34:50,450 --> 02:34:52,710
MATT: So what's your first range increment?

3759
02:34:52,710 --> 02:34:54,540
SAM: Uh...
MARISHA: Don't you have Sharpshooter?

3760
02:34:54,540 --> 02:34:56,560
SAM: I just got a feat, or whatever, so...

3761
02:34:58,590 --> 02:35:01,460
Well, it hasn't updated, but I think it's 120 feet.

3762
02:35:04,117 --> 02:35:07,820
MATT: For your hand crossbow?
LIAM: Because of Sharpshooter.

3763
02:35:07,820 --> 02:35:10,130
LAURA: Oh, yeah, Sharpshooter.
SAM: Sharpshooter.

3764
02:35:10,130 --> 02:35:14,840
LAURA: Which gives you 120 feet.
MATT: Let me double-check.

3765
02:35:14,840 --> 02:35:17,360
SAM: "Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage

3766
02:35:17,360 --> 02:35:18,220
"on your ranged weapon attack."

3767
02:35:18,220 --> 02:35:20,140
MATT: Right, it's still long range, though.

3768
02:35:20,140 --> 02:35:21,400
It's still the standard range.
SAM: Got it.

3769
02:35:21,400 --> 02:35:23,493
So 30 feet is my limit.

3770
02:35:23,493 --> 02:35:24,450
MATT: Correct.

3771
02:35:24,450 --> 02:35:26,230
If you fire further than 30 feet from it,

3772
02:35:26,230 --> 02:35:28,180
it's going to automatically miss.
SAM: Got it.

3773
02:35:28,180 --> 02:35:30,100
MATT: So keep that in mind, and...

3774
02:35:33,240 --> 02:35:36,630
TRAVIS: Oh, oh, oh. That's significant.

3775
02:35:36,630 --> 02:35:37,740
MATT: "Any attack has disadvantage

3776
02:35:37,740 --> 02:35:38,850
"unless the weapon is a crossbow."

3777
02:35:38,850 --> 02:35:40,210
So it does not have disadvantage,

3778
02:35:40,210 --> 02:35:42,550
but the bolt only goes as far as 30 feet before it floats.

3779
02:35:42,550 --> 02:35:43,430
SAM: Okay.

3780
02:35:43,430 --> 02:35:44,740
LIAM: Let's go, brawlers.

3781
02:35:44,740 --> 02:35:46,378
MATT: All right.
LAURA: Great.

3782
02:35:46,378 --> 02:35:51,378
But bonus on Freedom of Movement is you can't be...

3783
02:35:51,800 --> 02:35:53,220
Let me--
MARISHA: Can't be grappled.

3784
02:35:53,220 --> 02:35:55,320
LAURA: You can't be grappled, yeah.
MATT: Correct.

3785
02:35:56,614 --> 02:35:58,210
LAURA: And you can automatically escape

3786
02:35:58,210 --> 02:36:00,450
from any non-magical restraints

3787
02:36:01,780 --> 02:36:03,730
with just using five feet of movement.

3788
02:36:03,730 --> 02:36:06,360
MATT: That's phenomenal. So keep that in mind.

3789
02:36:06,360 --> 02:36:08,880
That might come in handy. All right.

3790
02:36:08,880 --> 02:36:10,170
We're going to go ahead and take a break here,

3791
02:36:10,170 --> 02:36:13,010
and return here for whatever
this battle's going to look like.

3792
02:36:13,010 --> 02:36:13,843
SAM: Yeah.

3793
02:36:13,843 --> 02:36:17,260
MATT: In the middle of an angry erupting volcano

3794
02:36:17,260 --> 02:36:19,000
and whatever Vokodo is.

3795
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,140
So we'll see you guys back here after the break shortly.

3796
02:36:21,140 --> 02:36:22,520
Be ready.

3820
02:37:49,883 --> 02:37:51,900
Hey, Critters, Laura Bailey here.

3821
02:37:51,900 --> 02:37:54,303
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role shop.

3822
02:37:55,860 --> 02:37:58,210
You're only like clicks away from owning this,

3823
02:37:58,210 --> 02:38:00,730
maybe more if you have a lot of windows open

3824
02:38:00,730 --> 02:38:02,913
on your browser, I don't know your life.

3825
02:38:03,970 --> 02:38:06,200
Darling, I recommend buying two,

3826
02:38:06,200 --> 02:38:10,593
one for you and another for you, let's be honest.

3827
02:38:12,131 --> 02:38:17,131
Oh, look at this, look at the details, oh.

3828
02:38:17,180 --> 02:38:20,990
All these and more now available in the Critical Role Shop.

3829
02:38:20,990 --> 02:38:23,657
(upbeat music)

3830
02:38:26,460 --> 02:38:27,473
Subscribe,

3831
02:38:29,260 --> 02:38:31,083
or don't subscribe,

3832
02:38:32,990 --> 02:38:35,063
(man sighs) that's not a question.

3833
02:38:37,370 --> 02:38:40,660
Well that is noble in the mind to ponder the pros

3834
02:38:40,660 --> 02:38:43,933
and more pros of Twitch or Twitch prime.

3835
02:38:45,320 --> 02:38:48,480
Or to take hands and gift new subs to Critters

3836
02:38:48,480 --> 02:38:50,363
who find they can't afford them.

3837
02:38:52,310 --> 02:38:53,273
To play,

3838
02:38:56,170 --> 02:38:57,003
to sleep,

3839
02:38:59,270 --> 02:39:00,103
no more.

3840
02:39:01,500 --> 02:39:05,160
And by a sleep to say the cast and crew of Critical Role

3841
02:39:05,160 --> 02:39:07,860
might find their naps around the hectic schedule

3842
02:39:07,860 --> 02:39:10,630
of a live broadcast that we have brought

3843
02:39:10,630 --> 02:39:14,663
for your consumption, both Critter and fan alike.

3844
02:39:17,310 --> 02:39:18,393
To play,

3845
02:39:19,520 --> 02:39:20,403
or sleep?

3846
02:39:22,037 --> 02:39:23,760
(man scoffs)

3847
02:39:23,760 --> 02:39:24,753
No sleep,

3848
02:39:25,770 --> 02:39:27,623
but just to stream.

3849
02:39:29,340 --> 02:39:30,983
All right there's the rub.

3850
02:39:32,110 --> 02:39:37,103
For, with your subscription, what screens may come.

3851
02:39:40,630 --> 02:39:43,350
Oh man, oh man, oh man, that is a fucking tagline.

3852
02:39:43,350 --> 02:39:44,273
Did we got that?

3853
02:39:45,212 --> 02:39:47,553
Oh, that is Twitch poetry.

3854
02:39:48,951 --> 02:39:50,330
(man grunting)

3855
02:39:50,330 --> 02:39:54,340
Oh, anyway, subscribe to Critical Role.

3856
02:39:54,340 --> 02:39:56,410
Use Twitch Prime to subscribe,

3857
02:39:56,410 --> 02:39:57,920
gift some subscriptions.

3858
02:39:57,920 --> 02:39:59,613
You, you got it.

3859
02:40:03,850 --> 02:40:08,652
Wrong slogan for the skull, but that's been good.

3860
02:40:08,652 --> 02:40:11,319
(upbeat music)

3861
02:52:45,600 --> 02:52:46,930
MATT: And welcome back.

3862
02:52:46,930 --> 02:52:50,700
So picking right up where we left off,

3863
02:52:50,700 --> 02:52:53,390
you all had entered--
LAURA: Oh, no!

3864
02:52:53,390 --> 02:52:58,170
MATT: -- the interior home, central chamber,

3865
02:52:58,170 --> 02:53:00,430
beneath the volcano of Rumblecusp

3866
02:53:00,430 --> 02:53:02,385
where Vokodo resides.

3867
02:53:04,608 --> 02:53:06,942
And let's go ahead and get that on the board.

3868
02:53:06,942 --> 02:53:08,771
(groaning)

3869
02:53:08,771 --> 02:53:12,040
LIAM: Oh, look at that, it's so small!
ASHLEY: Oh, my goodness gracious.

3870
02:53:12,040 --> 02:53:13,360
LAURA: He's so sparkly!
MARISHA: He lights up.

3871
02:53:13,360 --> 02:53:16,072
MATT: It's where the heat from the mouth comes from.

3872
02:53:17,821 --> 02:53:18,654
TALIESIN: ♪ Motorin'. ♪

3873
02:53:18,654 --> 02:53:20,511
LIAM: Holy shit.
ASHLEY: ♪ Motorin'. ♪

3874
02:53:20,511 --> 02:53:22,670
LAURA: (yelling)
SAM: It's too big!

3875
02:53:22,670 --> 02:53:26,298
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's pretty big.
ASHLEY: That's really big.

3876
02:53:26,298 --> 02:53:27,720
LAURA: It's a pretty big...

3877
02:53:27,720 --> 02:53:28,590
MATT: So--
LAURA: Oh, no.

3878
02:53:28,590 --> 02:53:30,120
MARISHA: Look at the treasure chest on his back.

3879
02:53:30,120 --> 02:53:32,170
That's so cute!

3880
02:53:32,170 --> 02:53:33,831
MATT: I'd like you all to roll initiative.

3881
02:53:33,831 --> 02:53:35,480
(groaning)
TRAVIS: Oh, god.

3882
02:53:35,480 --> 02:53:36,650
LIAM: It's like a bunch of dog poops

3883
02:53:36,650 --> 02:53:38,343
with treasure swirled into it.

3884
02:53:38,343 --> 02:53:41,170
MARISHA: (sighing)

3885
02:53:41,170 --> 02:53:43,330
TALIESIN: Gross.
LIAM: Aw, damn it!

3886
02:53:43,330 --> 02:53:44,380
I don't want a high initiative.

3887
02:53:44,380 --> 02:53:46,260
TRAVIS: Are you fucking kidding me?
LIAM: I'll watch.

3888
02:53:46,260 --> 02:53:48,010
TALIESIN: It's okay, I should go last anyway.

3889
02:53:48,010 --> 02:53:50,705
Healer should go last.

3890
02:53:50,705 --> 02:53:52,510
LIAM: I hate going first with Caleb.

3891
02:53:52,510 --> 02:53:54,820
TRAVIS: I'm definitely last.
SAM: I don't know.

3892
02:53:54,820 --> 02:53:56,520
TALIESIN: I don't know.
TRAVIS: Can you roll...

3893
02:53:57,560 --> 02:53:59,810
MATT: 20 or 25?
MARISHA: 21.

3894
02:53:59,810 --> 02:54:00,660
SAM: Yeah!
ASHLEY: Yes.

3895
02:54:00,660 --> 02:54:02,530
LIAM: 21.
SAM: Whoa!

3896
02:54:02,530 --> 02:54:04,360
MARISHA: Ah, fuck, Caleb! What?

3897
02:54:04,360 --> 02:54:06,333
TRAVIS: Caleb and Beau?
SAM: ♪ Empire. ♪

3898
02:54:06,333 --> 02:54:08,020
LAURA: (laughs)
MATT: Caleb, what'd you get?

3899
02:54:08,020 --> 02:54:09,590
LIAM: 21.
MARISHA: Also 21.

3900
02:54:09,590 --> 02:54:12,050
LAURA: But Beau's dex is higher.
TRAVIS: So Beau first.

3901
02:54:12,050 --> 02:54:13,970
SAM: I don't know about that.
LIAM: I mean...

3902
02:54:15,110 --> 02:54:16,810
Let's have a push-up contest.
MARISHA: Okay. (laughs)

3903
02:54:16,810 --> 02:54:21,250
MATT: 20 to 15?
ASHLEY: 15 for me.

3904
02:54:21,250 --> 02:54:23,400
MATT: 15, all right.
MARISHA: Nice.

3905
02:54:23,400 --> 02:54:24,966
LIAM: Oh, shit.

3906
02:54:26,710 --> 02:54:28,051
MATT: 15 to 10?

3907
02:54:29,352 --> 02:54:31,083
LAURA: 12.

3908
02:54:31,083 --> 02:54:33,853
MATT: 12 for Jester.

3909
02:54:36,360 --> 02:54:38,060
10 to 5?

3910
02:54:38,060 --> 02:54:38,960
TALIESIN: Five.

3911
02:54:38,960 --> 02:54:42,890
SAM: (bad American accent) I rolled an eight.
(laughter)

3912
02:54:42,890 --> 02:54:47,305
MATT: Thank you, Sam Riegel.
SAM: I'm a American soldier.

3913
02:54:47,305 --> 02:54:48,745
(laughter)

3914
02:54:48,745 --> 02:54:50,720
ASHLEY: He looks so cool.

3915
02:54:50,720 --> 02:54:53,040
LAURA: This is really beautiful.
ASHLEY: It's so cool.

3916
02:54:53,040 --> 02:54:55,017
LAURA: What a good environment for us all to die.

3917
02:54:55,017 --> 02:54:56,867
MATT: Yeah, if you're going to go.

3918
02:54:56,867 --> 02:54:58,140
And then--
LIAM: Is there a light in Vokodo,

3919
02:54:58,140 --> 02:54:59,170
or is it behind him?
MATT: Fjord?

3920
02:54:59,170 --> 02:55:00,130
MARISHA: It's in his mouth.

3921
02:55:00,130 --> 02:55:03,210
ASHLEY: Oh, no.
LAURA: Fjord!

3922
02:55:03,210 --> 02:55:05,565
ASHLEY: Does he have a light on his back?

3923
02:55:05,565 --> 02:55:06,618
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3924
02:55:06,618 --> 02:55:07,451
LAURA: There's a light in his mouth?

3925
02:55:07,451 --> 02:55:09,402
MARISHA: Mouth.
ASHLEY: That's his mouth?

3926
02:55:09,402 --> 02:55:12,260
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
LIAM: You're a very handsome man, Travis.

3927
02:55:12,260 --> 02:55:14,218
MATT: Right there.

3928
02:55:15,134 --> 02:55:18,090
LAURA: (groaning)
ASHLEY: Oh, that is so cool.

3929
02:55:18,090 --> 02:55:19,150
TALIESIN: None of this is happening.

3930
02:55:19,150 --> 02:55:21,860
SAM: You could use that as a emergency flashlight

3931
02:55:21,860 --> 02:55:23,053
to find your keys and stuff.

3932
02:55:23,053 --> 02:55:25,810
MATT: Exactly. It's what it's there for.

3933
02:55:25,810 --> 02:55:29,140
So, top of the round, as Vokodo pulls forward,

3934
02:55:29,140 --> 02:55:30,660
shouting at you all,

3935
02:55:30,660 --> 02:55:32,220
the water itself around you

3936
02:55:32,220 --> 02:55:34,730
seems to almost bubble in places,

3937
02:55:34,730 --> 02:55:38,730
and the heat is rising all around you.

3938
02:55:38,730 --> 02:55:42,070
Beauregard, you're up first, with Caleb on deck.

3939
02:55:42,070 --> 02:55:46,320
MARISHA: Does Jester get her Guiding Bolt as a surprise?

3940
02:55:46,320 --> 02:55:48,850
MATT: Wasn't a surprise round.
MARISHA: Oh.

3941
02:55:48,850 --> 02:55:51,610
MATT: He wasn't surprised. He knew you guys were coming.

3942
02:55:51,610 --> 02:55:53,850
So you initiating the Guiding Bolt...

3943
02:55:53,850 --> 02:55:55,500
So, you begin casting the Guiding Bolt,

3944
02:55:55,500 --> 02:55:57,730
because it's like a incantation.

3945
02:55:57,730 --> 02:55:59,510
Combat starts, initiative now,

3946
02:55:59,510 --> 02:56:01,650
so as you're casting the spell,

3947
02:56:01,650 --> 02:56:03,630
Beauregard rushes past you.
LAURA: Okay.

3948
02:56:03,630 --> 02:56:05,050
I don't know if I'll still want to do Guiding Bolt

3949
02:56:05,050 --> 02:56:06,420
by the time it's my turn, but...

3950
02:56:06,420 --> 02:56:08,730
MATT: Up to you, then. You can change before you get there.

3951
02:56:08,730 --> 02:56:10,510
LIAM: What's the lighting like in here?

3952
02:56:10,510 --> 02:56:11,990
For the humans and all that.

3953
02:56:11,990 --> 02:56:14,310
MATT: For the humans, it's low light.

3954
02:56:15,530 --> 02:56:17,810
Aside from the orange little patches you see

3955
02:56:17,810 --> 02:56:21,070
of where the different colors of orange are,

3956
02:56:21,070 --> 02:56:23,650
there is a 10-foot radius of bright light around it,

3957
02:56:23,650 --> 02:56:26,040
and then it is low light everywhere else in the chamber.

3958
02:56:26,040 --> 02:56:26,873
LIAM: Okay.

3959
02:56:26,873 --> 02:56:29,830
SAM: Does low light means we cannot see anything, or...

3960
02:56:29,830 --> 02:56:32,339
MATT: No, it just means for perception checks,

3961
02:56:32,339 --> 02:56:34,530
it's at disadvantage.

3962
02:56:34,530 --> 02:56:37,557
At a certain point for details beyond that...

3963
02:56:38,680 --> 02:56:41,980
Range attacks might be involved, but, you know,

3964
02:56:41,980 --> 02:56:43,190
let's see when we get there.

3965
02:56:43,190 --> 02:56:44,960
So, anyway, Beauregard. What are you doing?

3966
02:56:44,960 --> 02:56:49,400
MARISHA: Wow. I just lost feeling in my knees.

3967
02:56:49,400 --> 02:56:52,758
I would like to swim up to it, I guess.

3968
02:56:52,758 --> 02:56:56,066
I would like to swim up to it, I guess.

3969
02:56:56,066 --> 02:57:00,735
MATT: Right up front here?
SAM: God punching.

3970
02:57:00,735 --> 02:57:03,733
MARISHA: (stammering)

3971
02:57:03,733 --> 02:57:06,080
How much speed was that to get there?

3972
02:57:06,080 --> 02:57:07,139
MATT: To get there?

3973
02:57:07,139 --> 02:57:09,450
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: 25.

3974
02:57:09,450 --> 02:57:12,920
MARISHA: Okay. Can I get on top of his head?

3975
02:57:12,920 --> 02:57:14,960
Can I get on above it?

3976
02:57:14,960 --> 02:57:16,903
MATT: Sure, yeah, I'll let you do that,

3977
02:57:17,910 --> 02:57:20,050
since you have enough speed as a Monk.

3978
02:57:20,050 --> 02:57:22,420
SAM: Jeez.
MARISHA: (exhales)

3979
02:57:22,420 --> 02:57:25,980
MATT: So as you swim up over, as you rush up over,

3980
02:57:25,980 --> 02:57:28,350
you feel the heat blasting out of its mouth

3981
02:57:28,350 --> 02:57:30,900
as it lights up the front of Beau as you skid past,

3982
02:57:30,900 --> 02:57:33,770
the water around its mouth itself is almost boiling.

3983
02:57:33,770 --> 02:57:36,010
As you move up, you see the four eyes in the head

3984
02:57:36,010 --> 02:57:39,150
(clicking) clock you as you swim past them,

3985
02:57:39,150 --> 02:57:42,648
and then above you can see the massive collection

3986
02:57:42,648 --> 02:57:46,231
of coins and knickknacks and pottery

3987
02:57:46,231 --> 02:57:49,056
of coins and knickknacks and pottery

3988
02:57:49,056 --> 02:57:52,450
and weird furniture, all sorts of all things

3989
02:57:52,450 --> 02:57:55,033
that have been collected over time by Vokodo.

3990
02:57:55,033 --> 02:57:56,417
What are you doing?

3991
02:57:56,417 --> 02:57:57,610
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

3992
02:57:57,610 --> 02:58:00,070
I'm legitimately light-headed.

3993
02:58:01,560 --> 02:58:05,200
I'm going to swim up over him, and I'm going to try and use

3994
02:58:05,200 --> 02:58:07,090
one of the things that's attached to his back

3995
02:58:07,090 --> 02:58:08,970
to give me some leverage

3996
02:58:08,970 --> 02:58:12,800
to come down and power-bomb him from above.

3997
02:58:12,800 --> 02:58:14,539
MATT: Go for it.
ASHLEY: Yes!

3998
02:58:14,539 --> 02:58:15,761
MATT: (thudding)
LIAM: (bubbling)

3999
02:58:15,761 --> 02:58:17,390
MATT: Both fists out.
MARISHA: What are we doing?

4000
02:58:18,360 --> 02:58:19,839
Oh god!

4001
02:58:19,839 --> 02:58:21,530
(gasping) Pop pop!

4002
02:58:22,414 --> 02:58:23,547
Okay!

4003
02:58:24,552 --> 02:58:25,530
27

4004
02:58:25,530 --> 02:58:27,590
and 18.
MATT: Both hit.

4005
02:58:27,590 --> 02:58:29,080
LAURA: Oh, that's good!
TRAVIS: 18 hits.

4006
02:58:29,080 --> 02:58:30,938
MARISHA: 18 hits.
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

4007
02:58:30,938 --> 02:58:32,727
TALIESIN: Low AC.
LIAM: (Cartman voice) Come on, you guys.

4008
02:58:32,727 --> 02:58:34,022
Let's kill Vokodo.

4009
02:58:34,022 --> 02:58:37,188
MARISHA: (exhales shakily)
LAURA: (laughs)

4010
02:58:37,188 --> 02:58:40,763
MARISHA: First attack.

4011
02:58:43,165 --> 02:58:44,600
Yeah, okay, okay, okay, okay.

4012
02:58:44,600 --> 02:58:47,908
First attack is an eight, so that's cool.

4013
02:58:48,816 --> 02:58:51,660
14 damage. Stunning Strike.

4014
02:58:51,660 --> 02:58:55,542
MATT: 14 points of bludgeoning damage, Stunning Strike.

4015
02:58:55,542 --> 02:58:57,140
Ah, all right.

4016
02:58:57,140 --> 02:58:59,180
He's going to go ahead and use a Legendary Resistance

4017
02:58:59,180 --> 02:59:02,740
to not be stunned.
TRAVIS: Legendary Resistance.

4018
02:59:02,740 --> 02:59:05,280
MARISHA: One Resistance down! So nervous.

4019
02:59:05,280 --> 02:59:07,530
LAURA: Has he got three Resistances per round,

4020
02:59:07,530 --> 02:59:09,040
or three Resistances?
SAM: We don't know.

4021
02:59:09,040 --> 02:59:10,408
MATT: You don't know.
LAURA: (groaning)

4022
02:59:10,408 --> 02:59:11,442
SAM: But he just used a Resistance.

4023
02:59:11,442 --> 02:59:12,305
TRAVIS: I love it when you give us

4024
02:59:12,305 --> 02:59:13,603
the nonchalant, "You don't know."

4025
02:59:13,603 --> 02:59:14,490
I love it.
MARISHA: He just used one.

4026
02:59:14,490 --> 02:59:18,063
TRAVIS: The wiggle that comes with it.
MARISHA: With the Stunning Strike. Second attack.

4027
02:59:18,063 --> 02:59:18,896
Wow.

4028
02:59:18,896 --> 02:59:21,650
The opposite in the spectrum, seven damage.

4029
02:59:21,650 --> 02:59:22,840
MATT: Okay. Seven damage.

4030
02:59:22,840 --> 02:59:24,507
MARISHA: A Stunning Strike.

4031
02:59:27,736 --> 02:59:29,230
MATT: Success.
MARISHA: Okay.

4032
02:59:29,230 --> 02:59:31,500
MATT: It's a 16, right? What's your DC on that?

4033
02:59:31,500 --> 02:59:32,957
MARISHA: 16.
MATT: 16.

4034
02:59:36,380 --> 02:59:38,080
MARISHA: Flurry of Blows.
MATT: Go for it.

4035
02:59:38,080 --> 02:59:40,100
MARISHA: For my bonus.
ASHLEY: Let's go.

4036
02:59:40,100 --> 02:59:41,258
MATT: Each of these punches, by the way,

4037
02:59:41,258 --> 02:59:42,890
as you're punching him in the side,

4038
02:59:42,890 --> 02:59:46,006
it's like (punching) searing your knuckles.

4039
02:59:46,006 --> 02:59:47,147
MARISHA: (exhales)

4040
02:59:47,147 --> 02:59:52,147
(stammering) Water shouldn't be this hot.

4041
02:59:52,680 --> 02:59:56,032
Okay, it's bad.

4042
02:59:57,090 --> 02:59:59,990
21 on the first one.
MATT: That hits.

4043
02:59:59,990 --> 03:00:02,960
MARISHA: And 13 on the second.
MATT: 13 misses.

4044
03:00:02,960 --> 03:00:04,620
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: But the first one does hit.

4045
03:00:04,620 --> 03:00:05,870
Go ahead and roll damage.

4046
03:00:06,800 --> 03:00:08,930
SAM: What'd you roll on the first one?

4047
03:00:08,930 --> 03:00:10,090
MARISHA: 21.
LAURA: 21.

4048
03:00:10,090 --> 03:00:11,048
18 hit, though.

4049
03:00:11,048 --> 03:00:13,180
TALIESIN: 18, 13 is what we're at right now.

4050
03:00:13,180 --> 03:00:15,610
MARISHA: And...
LIAM: Go, Beau.

4051
03:00:15,610 --> 03:00:18,290
SAM: Vokodo-regard!
(laughter)

4052
03:00:18,290 --> 03:00:21,876
MARISHA: Oh no you Voko-don't-regard!
(laughter)

4053
03:00:21,876 --> 03:00:24,120
(laughs) 10 damage?

4054
03:00:24,120 --> 03:00:26,570
MATT: 10 points of damage, bludgeoning.

4055
03:00:26,570 --> 03:00:30,140
MARISHA: And Extra Aspects.
MATT: Okay.

4056
03:00:30,140 --> 03:00:32,850
So, all three hits and you pull back,

4057
03:00:32,850 --> 03:00:35,170
and the burning sensation

4058
03:00:35,170 --> 03:00:36,990
from all the blows you laid into him

4059
03:00:36,990 --> 03:00:39,510
do seven points of fire damage, total.

4060
03:00:39,510 --> 03:00:44,110
With each hit, the sheer temperature

4061
03:00:44,110 --> 03:00:48,800
of the surface of his hardened exterior burns your knuckles.

4062
03:00:48,800 --> 03:00:50,601
It's like (burning)

4063
03:00:50,601 --> 03:00:51,650
And as soon as you walk away, like,

4064
03:00:51,650 --> 03:00:54,080
"Ah, fuck, that hurt!"

4065
03:00:54,080 --> 03:00:57,980
So just know that hitting it with a melee hit

4066
03:00:57,980 --> 03:00:59,486
seems to to burn you back.

4067
03:00:59,486 --> 03:01:02,590
MARISHA: (groans) It burns, it burns! He burns!

4068
03:01:02,590 --> 03:01:04,220
MATT: You do learn that he is resistant

4069
03:01:04,220 --> 03:01:05,730
to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing

4070
03:01:05,730 --> 03:01:07,810
from non-magical attacks,

4071
03:01:07,810 --> 03:01:11,600
is resistant to cold damage.
MARISHA: Resistant to cold damage?

4072
03:01:11,600 --> 03:01:13,525
MATT: And is immune to fire damage.

4073
03:01:13,525 --> 03:01:14,977
MARISHA: Ooh, okay.

4074
03:01:16,835 --> 03:01:18,490
TALIESIN: Not vulnerable to anything?

4075
03:01:18,490 --> 03:01:19,760
MATT: Not vulnerable to anything, no.

4076
03:01:19,760 --> 03:01:21,290
MARISHA: I just shout out:

4077
03:01:22,320 --> 03:01:24,520
Obviously, think he's immune to fire.

4078
03:01:24,520 --> 03:01:27,000
Surprisingly, resistant to cold.

4079
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:28,450
Didn't see that one coming.

4080
03:01:29,350 --> 03:01:30,240
And then that's my turn.

4081
03:01:30,240 --> 03:01:32,290
SAM: Thanks for the commentary.
MATT: There you go.

4082
03:01:32,290 --> 03:01:34,290
That finishes Marisha. Caleb, you're up.

4083
03:01:35,800 --> 03:01:38,120
LIAM: I'm going to just pull out the Driftglobe

4084
03:01:38,960 --> 03:01:40,560
and say "Fajar"

4085
03:01:40,560 --> 03:01:43,150
and cast Daylight--
(laughter)

4086
03:01:43,150 --> 03:01:44,590
It's right here on the paper.
MATT: Yeah.

4087
03:01:44,590 --> 03:01:45,970
LIAM: Fajar.
TRAVIS: (laughs)

4088
03:01:45,970 --> 03:01:48,200
LIAM: I cast Daylight here inside the chamber.

4089
03:01:48,200 --> 03:01:50,840
And then I would like to shimmy towards the right

4090
03:01:50,840 --> 03:01:54,570
to try to block myself somewhat from his gaze.

4091
03:01:54,570 --> 03:01:56,050
MATT: Over here?
LIAM: Yeah.

4092
03:01:56,050 --> 03:01:57,790
SAM: Is there a gaze we should be worried about?

4093
03:01:57,790 --> 03:02:00,092
MATT: One, two, three's as much as you can move.

4094
03:02:00,092 --> 03:02:01,142
LIAM: Just line of sight.

4095
03:02:02,150 --> 03:02:04,180
MATT: You're swimming 15 feet with movement.

4096
03:02:04,180 --> 03:02:05,690
LIAM: Yeah. Right.

4097
03:02:05,690 --> 03:02:07,400
MATT: Are you going up at all or are you staying low,

4098
03:02:07,400 --> 03:02:09,220
just try and block off from the--?

4099
03:02:09,220 --> 03:02:11,160
LIAM: Yeah, I will. I will go on a diagonal.

4100
03:02:11,160 --> 03:02:12,811
TRAVIS: I will.
MATT: A diagonal? All right.

4101
03:02:12,811 --> 03:02:17,811
That'll put you about there.

4102
03:02:18,200 --> 03:02:19,730
ASHLEY: Fajar?
MATT: You've got it.

4103
03:02:19,730 --> 03:02:20,970
LIAM: Fajar.
ASHLEY: Fajar!

4104
03:02:22,303 --> 03:02:23,510
MARISHA: Fajarna.

4105
03:02:23,510 --> 03:02:26,168
MATT: Initiative count 20, lair action first.

4106
03:02:26,168 --> 03:02:27,351
LAURA: Oh, no!

4107
03:02:27,351 --> 03:02:28,184
TRAVIS: Wow.

4108
03:02:28,184 --> 03:02:30,420
TALIESIN: Paid the salt.

4109
03:02:30,420 --> 03:02:32,596
LIAM: This is fine.
ASHLEY: Oh, god. I'm getting nervous.

4110
03:02:32,596 --> 03:02:35,346
LAURA: (laughs)

4111
03:02:36,720 --> 03:02:38,650
LIAM: Remember when we spent two episodes preparing for this

4112
03:02:38,650 --> 03:02:42,270
and it made no impact?
(laughter)

4113
03:02:42,270 --> 03:02:44,980
SAM: Oh no. Laura Bailey, why?

4114
03:02:44,980 --> 03:02:46,470
MATT: In this vicinity--
ASHLEY: Oh.

4115
03:02:46,470 --> 03:02:48,900
MARISHA: We tried so hard to be good.
TRAVIS: What?

4116
03:02:48,900 --> 03:02:51,520
MATT: This strange wave of psychic energy

4117
03:02:52,400 --> 03:02:54,240
emanates from the side of the wall.

4118
03:02:54,240 --> 03:02:55,940
LIAM: Nope.
MATT: And causes all of you

4119
03:02:55,940 --> 03:03:00,260
to briefly shoot your attention straight towards Vokodo.

4120
03:03:00,260 --> 03:03:03,130
I need everyone except for Caleb and Veth

4121
03:03:03,130 --> 03:03:06,620
to go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw.

4122
03:03:06,620 --> 03:03:08,170
SAM: Hey!

4123
03:03:08,170 --> 03:03:09,860
TRAVIS: Advantage!
ASHLEY: Advantage, okay.

4124
03:03:09,860 --> 03:03:11,520
SAM: Also, for everyone who took a long rest,

4125
03:03:11,520 --> 03:03:14,250
it might have gotten rid of your temporary hit points,

4126
03:03:14,250 --> 03:03:17,076
so put those back up there.
LAURA: Oh, that's true.

4127
03:03:17,076 --> 03:03:18,430
MATT: Everyone has nine temporary hit points.

4128
03:03:18,430 --> 03:03:21,010
TRAVIS: Oh, good, good, good. 18.

4129
03:03:21,010 --> 03:03:24,030
MATT: 18. Jester?
LAURA: 27.

4130
03:03:24,030 --> 03:03:25,120
SAM: Ooh!

4131
03:03:25,120 --> 03:03:26,750
LIAM: I'm out of the way.
MATT: Yeah. Yasha?

4132
03:03:26,750 --> 03:03:27,738
ASHLEY: 13.
SAM: Balls.

4133
03:03:27,738 --> 03:03:29,490
TALIESIN: 29.

4134
03:03:29,490 --> 03:03:33,030
MATT: 29. Beauregard?
MARISHA: You didn't call me.

4135
03:03:33,030 --> 03:03:33,960
MATT: Oh, right, because you weren't there.

4136
03:03:33,960 --> 03:03:35,555
You're right.
MARISHA: I'm on his head.

4137
03:03:35,555 --> 03:03:38,620
MATT: So, as all of you shift and look,

4138
03:03:38,620 --> 03:03:39,710
you all shake it from view.

4139
03:03:39,710 --> 03:03:43,010
However, Yasha, your vision suddenly begins

4140
03:03:43,010 --> 03:03:44,610
to blur and swirl towards it,

4141
03:03:44,610 --> 03:03:46,640
and there's something alluring.

4142
03:03:46,640 --> 03:03:49,110
ASHLEY: I have no wisdom.
MATT: And for the time being,

4143
03:03:49,110 --> 03:03:50,180
you are hypnotized.

4144
03:03:50,180 --> 03:03:51,613
You are charmed by it.

4145
03:03:51,613 --> 03:03:53,612
(groaning)

4146
03:03:53,612 --> 03:03:57,040
MATT: On your turn, you're trying to get as close to it

4147
03:03:57,040 --> 03:03:58,340
as you possibly can.

4148
03:03:58,340 --> 03:04:00,520
You can only use your action to dash towards it.

4149
03:04:00,520 --> 03:04:01,630
LIAM: Man.

4150
03:04:01,630 --> 03:04:03,520
MATT: Until you're within five feet.

4151
03:04:03,520 --> 03:04:04,410
At the end of each of your turns,

4152
03:04:04,410 --> 03:04:05,720
you get to try and save from it.

4153
03:04:05,720 --> 03:04:06,850
Right now, when it comes to your turn,

4154
03:04:06,850 --> 03:04:09,450
all you can do is just get as close to it as you can.

4155
03:04:09,450 --> 03:04:11,730
Similar to when you first entered these tunnels,

4156
03:04:11,730 --> 03:04:14,490
you just need to get to this creature.

4157
03:04:14,490 --> 03:04:15,870
It's drawing you towards it.

4158
03:04:15,870 --> 03:04:17,670
TRAVIS: We might have to hit you.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4159
03:04:19,770 --> 03:04:21,320
Okay. Well, I'm going to go to it.

4160
03:04:22,340 --> 03:04:23,510
MATT: Ah, well it's not your turn yet.

4161
03:04:23,510 --> 03:04:25,102
ASHLEY: Oh, I am so sorry.

4162
03:04:25,102 --> 03:04:27,252
LAURA: Oh, at the end of it?
LIAM: That's how charmed you are.

4163
03:04:27,252 --> 03:04:29,250
MATT: That's the lair action.

4164
03:04:29,250 --> 03:04:31,960
Now it's Vilya and Vokodo.

4165
03:04:31,960 --> 03:04:33,360
Both actually rolled the same initiative.

4166
03:04:33,360 --> 03:04:35,085
TRAVIS: Okay, okay, okay.

4167
03:04:35,085 --> 03:04:36,390
MARISHA: They're working together!

4168
03:04:36,390 --> 03:04:39,400
MATT: Vilya's a little bit higher on there,

4169
03:04:39,400 --> 03:04:41,080
so she is going to go first.

4170
03:04:42,090 --> 03:04:44,400
She, looking around in the space here,

4171
03:04:44,400 --> 03:04:46,440
sees everyone's face shift.

4172
03:04:46,440 --> 03:04:48,590
She also resists the effect.

4173
03:04:48,590 --> 03:04:50,270
Looks about angrily, everything seems fine.

4174
03:04:50,270 --> 03:04:52,140
She goes ahead and takes her staff,

4175
03:04:52,140 --> 03:04:52,973
holds it in front of her,

4176
03:04:52,973 --> 03:04:55,960
and begins swirling it overhead like this, and as it does,

4177
03:04:55,960 --> 03:04:59,380
soot from the ground begins to lift up out of the ground

4178
03:04:59,380 --> 03:05:00,920
and form these blackened clouds

4179
03:05:00,920 --> 03:05:03,823
that begin to crackle over the top of this darkened chamber.

4180
03:05:03,823 --> 03:05:06,182
(lightning crackling)

4181
03:05:06,182 --> 03:05:09,890
She forms an underwater storm cloud

4182
03:05:09,890 --> 03:05:11,740
LAURA: Shit!

4183
03:05:11,740 --> 03:05:14,180
MARISHA: That's dope!
ASHLEY: So cool.

4184
03:05:14,180 --> 03:05:16,575
TRAVIS: Water's a hell of a conductor, though.

4185
03:05:16,575 --> 03:05:19,150
TALIESIN: Yeah. If we've learned anything about your mom,

4186
03:05:19,150 --> 03:05:21,612
it's that water is not her favorite terrain.

4187
03:05:21,612 --> 03:05:24,362
(groaning)

4188
03:05:25,325 --> 03:05:26,985
TRAVIS: Wow. Wow!

4189
03:05:26,985 --> 03:05:28,193
TALIESIN: It's been a rough month, Matt.

4190
03:05:28,193 --> 03:05:29,690
TRAVIS: That was some millennia shade!

4191
03:05:29,690 --> 03:05:32,470
MATT: She's going to cast it at 5th-level.

4192
03:05:32,470 --> 03:05:33,303
SAM: 5th-level?

4193
03:05:33,303 --> 03:05:34,886
MATT: She's casting it at 5th-level.

4194
03:05:34,886 --> 03:05:36,330
MARISHA: (laughs)
MATT: And with her bonus action,

4195
03:05:36,330 --> 03:05:39,060
she's going to transform into a killer whale,

4196
03:05:39,060 --> 03:05:40,700
which I do not have a mini for.

4197
03:05:40,700 --> 03:05:41,533
SAM: Ugh.

4198
03:05:41,533 --> 03:05:42,615
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

4199
03:05:42,615 --> 03:05:43,448
MATT: So instead I'm going to be using this,

4200
03:05:43,448 --> 03:05:44,890
because it's roughly the size.

4201
03:05:46,170 --> 03:05:47,820
That gives her a swim speed of 60,

4202
03:05:47,820 --> 03:05:51,370
so she's going to go ahead and shift over here--

4203
03:05:51,370 --> 03:05:53,610
LIAM: That gator is insane.
MATT: -- on to the side over there,

4204
03:05:53,610 --> 03:05:54,730
and swimming up against the side.

4205
03:05:54,730 --> 03:05:56,250
As this killer whale spins around,

4206
03:05:56,250 --> 03:05:57,870
a bolt shoots down towards Vokodo,

4207
03:05:57,870 --> 03:05:59,792
who has to making a dexterity saving throw.

4208
03:05:59,792 --> 03:06:02,110
Makes it. Natural 18.

4209
03:06:02,980 --> 03:06:06,920
However, that puts the damage at 6th-level to--

4210
03:06:09,480 --> 03:06:13,350
Believe it's 5d10 points of lightning damage.

4211
03:06:13,350 --> 03:06:15,420
SAM: Hey!
LAURA: Ooh.

4212
03:06:15,420 --> 03:06:16,836
SAM: Go Vilya.

4213
03:06:20,683 --> 03:06:22,690
TRAVIS: That's serious.

4214
03:06:22,690 --> 03:06:24,156
MATT: Ooh, nice.

4215
03:06:27,053 --> 03:06:29,570
TALIESIN: Can I do a thing?
MATT: 33 points of damage,

4216
03:06:29,570 --> 03:06:32,385
reduced to 16.
ASHLEY: I know. I'm nervous eating.

4217
03:06:32,385 --> 03:06:33,753
(laughter)

4218
03:06:33,753 --> 03:06:35,390
MATT: 16 points of lightning damage.
ASHLEY: I'm sorry.

4219
03:06:35,390 --> 03:06:40,390
MATT: She's now a lightning storm-casting killer whale.

4220
03:06:40,510 --> 03:06:43,660
Finishing Vilya's go, it is now Vokodo.

4221
03:06:43,660 --> 03:06:46,170
The water is now getting to a subtle boil around you.

4222
03:06:46,170 --> 03:06:48,350
While it's not damaging you this round, you gather

4223
03:06:48,350 --> 03:06:50,250
it's probably going to start damaging you pretty soon

4224
03:06:50,250 --> 03:06:53,060
just being in this chamber.

4225
03:06:53,060 --> 03:06:57,073
But for Vokodo's turn, let's see what we got here.

4226
03:06:59,176 --> 03:07:03,992
(dramatic battle music)

4227
03:07:07,522 --> 03:07:11,260
Looking around at the space, the eye shifting,

4228
03:07:11,260 --> 03:07:16,227
after it takes the blows from on top, to you, Beauregard,

4229
03:07:17,440 --> 03:07:19,550
and then angrily, two of the eyes glare up towards you,

4230
03:07:19,550 --> 03:07:22,915
and the voice gutturally growls within and goes,

4231
03:07:22,915 --> 03:07:25,638
"(groans) Can't have that."

4232
03:07:26,490 --> 03:07:29,430
I need you to make a wisdom saving throw for me.

4233
03:07:29,430 --> 03:07:32,150
TRAVIS: Fucking shit. Come on, Beau!

4234
03:07:32,150 --> 03:07:35,350
MARISHA: Thank god for these Heroes' Feasts, man.

4235
03:07:36,210 --> 03:07:39,950
Okay, I rolled a 19 and an 18.
SAM: Whoa!

4236
03:07:39,950 --> 03:07:44,950
MARISHA: So my Wisdom save is plus four, so 23 total.

4237
03:07:45,330 --> 03:07:48,910
MATT: (dejected) Yeah, that'll do it.
(laughter)

4238
03:07:48,910 --> 03:07:51,590
SAM: You angered the god Vokodo.
MARISHA: Lucky roll, lucky roll.

4239
03:07:51,590 --> 03:07:53,640
MATT: So, as the two eyes look towards you,

4240
03:07:53,640 --> 03:07:56,410
you feel this psychic wave strike your brain

4241
03:07:56,410 --> 03:07:59,020
and for a second, you feel like something

4242
03:07:59,020 --> 03:08:01,880
is trying to grasp hold of your will,

4243
03:08:01,880 --> 03:08:04,750
and you remember yourself back on that shoreline,

4244
03:08:04,750 --> 03:08:07,073
meditating on the Menagerie Coast, and--

4245
03:08:07,073 --> 03:08:09,510
(shattering) you shatter that hold.

4246
03:08:09,510 --> 03:08:11,685
No effect.

4247
03:08:11,685 --> 03:08:14,733
MARISHA: I just say: Ew, your
eyes can look backwards. Gross.

4248
03:08:14,733 --> 03:08:17,170
(laughter)

4249
03:08:17,170 --> 03:08:20,040
MARISHA: With that, he's going to attempt to move backward,

4250
03:08:20,040 --> 03:08:22,110
like an octopus. (water rushing)

4251
03:08:22,110 --> 03:08:22,943
Swirl back.

4252
03:08:22,943 --> 03:08:25,180
You do get to take a reaction if you want to.

4253
03:08:25,180 --> 03:08:27,005
MARISHA: Yes, I do.

4254
03:08:30,358 --> 03:08:33,420
Yeah, 25 to hit.
MATT: 25 hits.

4255
03:08:33,420 --> 03:08:35,910
Go ahead and roll damage, and Sentinel--

4256
03:08:35,910 --> 03:08:38,400
MARISHA: Sentinel, he's not going anywhere.

4257
03:08:38,400 --> 03:08:41,487
11 damage.
MATT: 11 points of damage, okay.

4258
03:08:41,487 --> 03:08:42,430
So he tries to move back,

4259
03:08:42,430 --> 03:08:44,740
and Beauregard punches right back down in the head,

4260
03:08:44,740 --> 03:08:47,432
taking another three points of fire damage.

4261
03:08:48,850 --> 03:08:51,820
But in doing so, the eyes curl in

4262
03:08:51,820 --> 03:08:53,250
and look back in different directions,

4263
03:08:53,250 --> 03:08:55,840
briefly shaken, and it stays in place.

4264
03:08:55,840 --> 03:08:58,310
You can now feel just the space around it

4265
03:08:58,310 --> 03:09:02,727
is vibrating with anger.
(growling)

4266
03:09:03,810 --> 03:09:05,460
That's going to end Vokodo's turn.

4267
03:09:05,460 --> 03:09:09,390
Yasha, for your turn, you spend the entirety of it

4268
03:09:09,390 --> 03:09:12,020
swimming forward and getting as close as you can to Vokodo,

4269
03:09:12,020 --> 03:09:14,380
which is right up there,

4270
03:09:14,380 --> 03:09:15,630
and you just stand there and stare.

4271
03:09:15,630 --> 03:09:19,000
You all watch as Yasha just floating in the water,

4272
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:21,470
stares, head slightly cocked to the side,

4273
03:09:21,470 --> 03:09:23,890
either enthralled by the jewelry on its back

4274
03:09:23,890 --> 03:09:26,040
or the actual entity itself.

4275
03:09:26,040 --> 03:09:28,380
I need you, Yasha, to go ahead and make

4276
03:09:28,380 --> 03:09:31,200
a Wisdom saving throw at the end of your turn.

4277
03:09:31,200 --> 03:09:34,150
TALIESIN: With advantage?
MATT: With advantage.

4278
03:09:34,150 --> 03:09:35,990
This Heroes' Feast is going to save your guys' fucking ass,

4279
03:09:35,990 --> 03:09:37,400
I swear to god.

4280
03:09:37,400 --> 03:09:38,530
ASHLEY: Cocked.

4281
03:09:38,530 --> 03:09:41,396
MARISHA: Shake it, shake it!

4282
03:09:41,396 --> 03:09:42,870
TRAVIS: Shake it good.

4283
03:09:42,870 --> 03:09:44,920
ASHLEY: 15?

4284
03:09:44,920 --> 03:09:46,180
Nothing?
TALIESIN: Nothing, oh!

4285
03:09:46,180 --> 03:09:50,579
MATT: 15 does not succeed.
ASHLEY: (growling)

4286
03:09:50,579 --> 03:09:51,720
You stand there holding your space,

4287
03:09:51,720 --> 03:09:55,053
still glaring at it.

4288
03:09:56,567 --> 03:09:57,403
ASHLEY: All right.

4289
03:09:57,403 --> 03:09:59,485
MATT: At the end of your turn,

4290
03:09:59,485 --> 03:10:01,310
it's going to go ahead and use a Legendary Action,

4291
03:10:01,310 --> 03:10:03,720
since you're right up in its face now,

4292
03:10:03,720 --> 03:10:06,290
to use its bite attack.
MARISHA: Shuck in the nose.

4293
03:10:06,290 --> 03:10:09,130
MATT: So as you're right there, its jaws begin to open,

4294
03:10:09,130 --> 03:10:11,510
and you can see the elongated, pointed,

4295
03:10:11,510 --> 03:10:13,230
almost obsidian-like teeth,

4296
03:10:13,230 --> 03:10:15,190
reveal this bright yellow light

4297
03:10:15,190 --> 03:10:16,620
that burns from the inside,

4298
03:10:16,620 --> 03:10:18,660
like the heat itself has become like

4299
03:10:18,660 --> 03:10:20,260
the front of a hooded lantern,

4300
03:10:20,260 --> 03:10:22,040
but intensely more bright.

4301
03:10:22,040 --> 03:10:24,520
You watch as Yasha's framed in dark shadow,

4302
03:10:24,520 --> 03:10:26,250
from your guys' perspective behind her,

4303
03:10:26,250 --> 03:10:29,030
before it (growls) lurches forward

4304
03:10:29,030 --> 03:10:30,862
to try and bite down on her.

4305
03:10:30,862 --> 03:10:32,260
MARISHA: The deadlights.

4306
03:10:32,260 --> 03:10:34,551
MATT: That is going to be a...

4307
03:10:36,568 --> 03:10:38,074
22 to hit.

4308
03:10:38,074 --> 03:10:40,523
ASHLEY: (laughs) Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

4309
03:10:40,523 --> 03:10:44,963
As it bites down on you, Yasha, you take...

4310
03:10:47,480 --> 03:10:50,510
TRAVIS: You don't need all those
dice. You can just use half.

4311
03:10:50,510 --> 03:10:52,050
MATT: 17 points of slashing damage.

4312
03:10:52,050 --> 03:10:53,620
SAM: Oof!
ASHLEY: Okay.

4313
03:10:53,620 --> 03:10:55,300
MATT: Plus 10 points of fire damage.

4314
03:10:55,300 --> 03:10:56,900
TRAVIS: Great.
ASHLEY: Okay.

4315
03:10:59,040 --> 03:11:01,620
MATT: And that's its Legendary Action on that round.

4316
03:11:01,620 --> 03:11:04,478
Finishing Yasha's go. Jester, you're up.

4317
03:11:05,425 --> 03:11:10,420
LAURA: (sighs) Okay. Um...

4318
03:11:10,420 --> 03:11:12,246
TRAVIS: (stammering)

4319
03:11:13,080 --> 03:11:16,610
LAURA: This is going to-- (groans)

4320
03:11:18,900 --> 03:11:22,320
I'm going to try to use up some of his...

4321
03:11:22,320 --> 03:11:24,260
I'm going to cast Command.

4322
03:11:24,260 --> 03:11:25,620
MATT: Cast Command on him?
LAURA: Yeah.

4323
03:11:25,620 --> 03:11:27,170
MATT: Okay. What are you commanding?

4324
03:11:27,170 --> 03:11:29,230
SAM: Drown. (laughs)
MATT: (laughs)

4325
03:11:29,230 --> 03:11:30,870
LAURA: Grovel!

4326
03:11:30,870 --> 03:11:31,810
MATT: Grovel.
SAM: Oh!

4327
03:11:31,810 --> 03:11:33,110
MATT: Okay, that's a Wisdom saving throw?

4328
03:11:33,110 --> 03:11:34,301
LAURA: Yeah.

4329
03:11:36,010 --> 03:11:38,550
MATT: 16. What's your DC?

4330
03:11:38,550 --> 03:11:40,110
LAURA: 17!
MARISHA: Oh my god.

4331
03:11:40,110 --> 03:11:41,618
MATT: 17?

4332
03:11:43,990 --> 03:11:47,240
Yeah, he'll grovel.
TRAVIS: (gasping)

4333
03:11:51,018 --> 03:11:52,870
TRAVIS: You sound like you're not sweating it, though.

4334
03:11:52,870 --> 03:11:54,900
MARISHA: I know. I know.

4335
03:11:54,900 --> 03:11:55,950
TALIESIN: Are we starting this shit now,

4336
03:11:55,950 --> 03:11:59,410
or are we waiting around?
SAM: What? Starting what?

4337
03:11:59,410 --> 03:12:02,310
MATT: So, next turn it'll fall prone and end its turn.

4338
03:12:02,310 --> 03:12:04,240
MARISHA: In terms of...
TRAVIS: He falls prone, like

4339
03:12:04,240 --> 03:12:07,070
to the floor of the cavern?
MATT: Mm-hmm.

4340
03:12:07,070 --> 03:12:08,620
LAURA: Yeah, and he'll end his...

4341
03:12:08,620 --> 03:12:10,860
So he won't take a turn?
MATT: He'll lose a turn.

4342
03:12:10,860 --> 03:12:13,660
LAURA: Okay.
SAM: He would rather lose a turn.

4343
03:12:13,660 --> 03:12:15,650
MATT: He still has Legendary Actions, though.

4344
03:12:15,650 --> 03:12:16,483
SAM: Yeah.

4345
03:12:16,483 --> 03:12:17,728
ASHLEY: How many Legendary Actions does he have?

4346
03:12:17,728 --> 03:12:19,515
LIAM: We don't know.
LAURA: We don't know.

4347
03:12:19,515 --> 03:12:20,371
ASHLEY: Okay.
LIAM: Don't know.

4348
03:12:20,371 --> 03:12:22,328
MATT: All right. Does that finish your go, Jester?

4349
03:12:22,328 --> 03:12:23,367
LAURA: Um.

4350
03:12:23,367 --> 03:12:24,620
MATT: You still have your bonus action.

4351
03:12:24,620 --> 03:12:26,210
LAURA: I'm going to move.

4352
03:12:26,210 --> 03:12:28,500
MATT: Where are you moving?
LAURA: I'm going to swim.

4353
03:12:30,074 --> 03:12:32,424
I just want to not be in the cone.

4354
03:12:34,520 --> 03:12:39,380
Can I swim towards Caleb and up?

4355
03:12:40,330 --> 03:12:42,713
MATT: Towards Caleb and up? Okay.

4356
03:12:43,910 --> 03:12:45,700
Full 15 feet at an angle, you mean?

4357
03:12:45,700 --> 03:12:46,610
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

4358
03:12:47,620 --> 03:12:49,230
We'll say that'll put you about there.

4359
03:12:49,230 --> 03:12:51,050
LAURA: Okay, I don't know.

4360
03:12:51,050 --> 03:12:54,240
And I'm going to send my duplicate

4361
03:12:54,240 --> 03:12:57,250
the full movement that I can towards Vokodo.

4362
03:12:57,250 --> 03:13:00,620
MATT: That'll be about there. Also higher up?

4363
03:13:00,620 --> 03:13:02,140
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

4364
03:13:02,140 --> 03:13:03,710
LAURA: I want her to come up underneath him,

4365
03:13:03,710 --> 03:13:06,407
like under his belly, if she can.
MATT: Under his belly? Okay.

4366
03:13:06,407 --> 03:13:08,411
I'll just say you're right there,

4367
03:13:08,411 --> 03:13:09,910
and we'll understand it's under the belly.

4368
03:13:10,780 --> 03:13:12,950
You got it. All right, end of your turn.

4369
03:13:12,950 --> 03:13:15,190
Vokodo's going to go ahead and
use two of the Legendary Actions

4370
03:13:15,190 --> 03:13:17,130
to use Reflexive Magic.

4371
03:13:17,130 --> 03:13:18,620
LAURA: Well, she's not going to be directly underneath him

4372
03:13:18,620 --> 03:13:19,453
if he's going to fall prone,

4373
03:13:19,453 --> 03:13:21,480
so she's going to be, move back a little bit.

4374
03:13:22,450 --> 03:13:25,010
MATT: Okay. So, there?
LAURA: Yeah.

4375
03:13:25,010 --> 03:13:26,490
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Reflexive Magic?

4376
03:13:26,490 --> 03:13:28,000
MATT: Gonna use Reflexive Magic.

4377
03:13:28,000 --> 03:13:30,460
So it gets to cast a spell at fourth level or lower

4378
03:13:30,460 --> 03:13:32,830
as a Legendary Action.
TRAVIS: Jesus.

4379
03:13:32,830 --> 03:13:34,950
MATT: It's going to go ahead-- and you watch as Beauregard,

4380
03:13:34,950 --> 03:13:36,390
you're right on top above it,

4381
03:13:36,390 --> 03:13:38,720
and Yasha's right there in front of it.

4382
03:13:38,720 --> 03:13:41,110
You watch the entire form of Vokodo just--

4383
03:13:41,110 --> 03:13:42,130
(rushing water)

4384
03:13:42,130 --> 03:13:43,560
Vanishes.
MARISHA: Why?

4385
03:13:43,560 --> 03:13:45,500
LIAM: It was casting just then?
MATT: It was.

4386
03:13:45,500 --> 03:13:48,280
LIAM: Could I have eyes on, or am I hidden?

4387
03:13:48,280 --> 03:13:49,113
MATT: You would have eyes on.

4388
03:13:49,113 --> 03:13:50,100
LIAM: Counterspell.
MARISHA: Yes!

4389
03:13:50,100 --> 03:13:52,647
MATT: What's the range on Counterspell?

4390
03:13:52,647 --> 03:13:55,360
SAM: 60?
LIAM: I think that's right, hold on.

4391
03:13:55,360 --> 03:13:58,690
LAURA: 60?
LIAM: Yeah, it's 60 feet.

4392
03:13:58,690 --> 03:14:00,610
MATT: 60 feet. Definitely within range.

4393
03:14:00,610 --> 03:14:01,960
It's a fourth-level spell,

4394
03:14:01,960 --> 03:14:05,030
so I need you to go ahead and roll--

4395
03:14:05,030 --> 03:14:07,390
TRAVIS: Is he teleporting or going invisible?

4396
03:14:07,390 --> 03:14:08,223
MATT: Hmm?
LAURA: We don't know.

4397
03:14:08,223 --> 03:14:10,723
MATT: You don't know.
LIAM: No, I'll do it at fifth level.

4398
03:14:10,723 --> 03:14:12,239
MARISHA: Oh shit.

4399
03:14:12,239 --> 03:14:14,350
MATT: Okay. Okay.

4400
03:14:14,350 --> 03:14:18,781
He stays put. You have Counterspelled his Dimension Door.

4401
03:14:18,781 --> 03:14:21,694
TRAVIS: (gasping)

4402
03:14:21,694 --> 03:14:24,040
TRAVIS: He was leaving, which...

4403
03:14:24,040 --> 03:14:26,140
SAM: Maybe. Or maybe he was just bouncing around the room.

4404
03:14:26,140 --> 03:14:27,690
LIAM: To a different place. Yeah, we don't know.

4405
03:14:27,690 --> 03:14:29,920
MATT: All right. That finishes Jester's go.

4406
03:14:29,920 --> 03:14:31,240
Veth, you're up. Caduceus, you're in back.

4407
03:14:31,240 --> 03:14:32,660
SAM: Oh my god, I have to do something?

4408
03:14:32,660 --> 03:14:33,980
MATT: Yeah, you do.

4409
03:14:33,980 --> 03:14:36,688
SAM: I can't get within 30 feet of this dude, right?

4410
03:14:38,194 --> 03:14:39,442
MATT: Yeah, you could get within 30 feet.

4411
03:14:39,442 --> 03:14:41,420
SAM: Really?
MARISHA: (laughs)

4412
03:14:41,420 --> 03:14:43,865
Were you hoping he was going to tell you no?

4413
03:14:43,865 --> 03:14:46,790
ASHLEY: (laughs) Yeah. I can't do this, right?

4414
03:14:46,790 --> 03:14:48,542
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

4415
03:14:48,542 --> 03:14:50,120
ASHLEY: Can I just stay in my comfort zone?

4416
03:14:50,120 --> 03:14:53,020
SAM: And how does Sneak Attack work?

4417
03:14:53,020 --> 03:14:55,490
It's engaged with Beau, but...

4418
03:14:55,490 --> 03:14:56,510
MATT: It's engaged with Beau.

4419
03:14:56,510 --> 03:14:59,700
You have disadvantage on the attack roll.

4420
03:14:59,700 --> 03:15:02,250
No, no, you don't, because it's a crossbow.

4421
03:15:02,250 --> 03:15:03,170
SAM: Yes.
MATT: So you have a 30 feet--

4422
03:15:03,170 --> 03:15:04,170
it's just a straight attack roll,

4423
03:15:04,170 --> 03:15:07,040
and if it hits, because Beau and Yasha are within range,

4424
03:15:07,040 --> 03:15:08,180
you do get Sneak Attack, at range.

4425
03:15:08,180 --> 03:15:09,660
SAM: Okay.

4426
03:15:09,660 --> 03:15:10,770
Okay, then, I'll do that.

4427
03:15:10,770 --> 03:15:13,090
I will swim as far as I need to

4428
03:15:13,090 --> 03:15:16,900
to be within 30 feet.
MATT: Okay. Five, 10.

4429
03:15:16,900 --> 03:15:19,400
You're probably swimming past Jester.

4430
03:15:19,400 --> 03:15:20,233
SAM: Sure.

4431
03:15:20,233 --> 03:15:22,268
MATT: And getting right about there.

4432
03:15:23,833 --> 03:15:27,470
SAM: I will fire.
MATT: Go for it. Roll an attack.

4433
03:15:27,470 --> 03:15:29,850
SAM: Okay, 22 to hit.
MATT: That hits.

4434
03:15:29,850 --> 03:15:31,390
You can go ahead and roll damage.

4435
03:15:31,390 --> 03:15:32,823
SAM: All right.

4436
03:15:38,102 --> 03:15:41,293
Oh, boy. (sighs)

4437
03:15:41,293 --> 03:15:45,207
(intense, dramatic music)

4438
03:15:45,207 --> 03:15:48,140
SAM: Ay yai yai. 34 points of damage.

4439
03:15:48,140 --> 03:15:50,549
MATT: 34 points of damage, nice.

4440
03:15:53,000 --> 03:15:54,678
SAM: And then I will...

4441
03:15:55,680 --> 03:15:58,640
I could hide, or go away?

4442
03:15:58,640 --> 03:16:00,130
MATT: You have nothing to hide right now.

4443
03:16:00,130 --> 03:16:02,070
You're out in the open after firing your crossbow

4444
03:16:02,070 --> 03:16:03,200
to get close enough.
SAM: All right.

4445
03:16:03,200 --> 03:16:04,520
I'll just shoot again.

4446
03:16:04,520 --> 03:16:06,118
MATT: Go for it. Roll another attack.

4447
03:16:06,118 --> 03:16:10,340
SAM: And this one, I'll do Sharpshooter.

4448
03:16:10,340 --> 03:16:13,090
MATT: Okay, minus five to hit.
SAM: Yeah.

4449
03:16:14,430 --> 03:16:16,650
SAM: 21.
MATT: 21 and then...

4450
03:16:16,650 --> 03:16:18,940
SAM: So, 26.
MATT: Oh, then that does hit.

4451
03:16:18,940 --> 03:16:21,233
Go ahead and roll damage with the plus 10 damage.

4452
03:16:21,233 --> 03:16:23,813
SAM: (groaning)

4453
03:16:23,813 --> 03:16:25,175
17 points.

4454
03:16:26,670 --> 03:16:28,810
MATT: Aw!
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4455
03:16:28,810 --> 03:16:31,469
MATT: Only over 50 damage in one round, aw!

4456
03:16:31,469 --> 03:16:32,540
(laughter)

4457
03:16:32,540 --> 03:16:35,082
So as you fire a second time, both of them (whoosh)

4458
03:16:35,082 --> 03:16:37,390
sink into the sides, and the bolts split in.

4459
03:16:37,390 --> 03:16:40,690
You watch as the bolts heat up red,

4460
03:16:40,690 --> 03:16:43,577
just being stuck in the side of a creature

4461
03:16:43,577 --> 03:16:45,760
this high in temperature.

4462
03:16:45,760 --> 03:16:49,761
But it (groans and growls)

4463
03:16:49,761 --> 03:16:52,450
SAM: Uh-oh, doesn't like that. Oh god!

4464
03:16:52,450 --> 03:16:55,100
MATT: All right, that's your turn.
SAM: Yep.

4465
03:16:55,100 --> 03:16:57,400
MATT: Caduceus, you're up. Fjord, you're on deck.

4466
03:16:57,400 --> 03:16:59,091
TALIESIN: Um...

4467
03:17:00,791 --> 03:17:03,082
Quick, Caleb, are you going for it?

4468
03:17:03,082 --> 03:17:06,741
About to go for it?
LIAM: (stammering)

4469
03:17:06,741 --> 03:17:08,962
TALIESIN: Yeah, all right.
LIAM: Yeah.

4470
03:17:08,962 --> 03:17:11,262
MARISHA: (laughs)
TALIESIN: Am I within 30 feet of...?

4471
03:17:12,100 --> 03:17:15,450
MATT: You are just outside of 30-foot range.

4472
03:17:15,450 --> 03:17:18,010
TALIESIN: Can I get to 30 feet?
MATT: You can, yeah.

4473
03:17:18,010 --> 03:17:18,843
TALIESIN: Will I have room

4474
03:17:18,843 --> 03:17:20,977
to try and take cover after getting there?

4475
03:17:20,977 --> 03:17:24,660
MATT: You, no. (laughs)
TALIESIN: Okay.

4476
03:17:24,660 --> 03:17:26,300
I'm right in the middle of a bunch of people, aren't I?

4477
03:17:26,300 --> 03:17:29,160
LAURA: Yeah. We're just kind of clustered.
MATT: You could probably move here if you want to.

4478
03:17:29,160 --> 03:17:31,620
TALIESIN: And still be 30?
MATT: Maybe.

4479
03:17:31,620 --> 03:17:34,003
You can try it and we can measure when you do.

4480
03:17:37,270 --> 03:17:39,000
TALIESIN: Fuck me, man. Okay.

4481
03:17:39,000 --> 03:17:41,960
I hate it when you do that.
LAURA: (laughs)

4482
03:17:41,960 --> 03:17:45,170
MATT: So either you take cover,
or not take cover and be sure.

4483
03:17:45,170 --> 03:17:48,080
Your call.
TALIESIN: I'll not take cover.

4484
03:17:48,080 --> 03:17:49,932
MATT: Okay.

4485
03:17:49,932 --> 03:17:51,340
So you can move about there and be sure

4486
03:17:51,340 --> 03:17:53,510
that you can get him in 30 feet.
LAURA: Oh, I feel so pukey, y'all.

4487
03:17:53,510 --> 03:17:54,500
TALIESIN: Before I move there,

4488
03:17:54,500 --> 03:17:56,628
I'm going to use my bonus action to turn invisible.

4489
03:17:56,628 --> 03:17:58,110
ASHLEY: (sighing)
MATT: Okay.

4490
03:17:58,110 --> 03:18:00,500
LAURA: Huh?
MATT: You vanish from sight,

4491
03:18:00,500 --> 03:18:02,550
and then shift over--
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold

4492
03:18:03,420 --> 03:18:07,000
a Divine Domain Channel Divinity

4493
03:18:07,000 --> 03:18:09,790
for right before Caleb's attack.

4494
03:18:09,790 --> 03:18:12,453
MATT: Okay, okay.
LIAM: Harsh one.

4495
03:18:12,453 --> 03:18:13,460
Harsh spell, that's going to--
MATT: So you're holding an action

4496
03:18:13,460 --> 03:18:15,593
to Channel Divinity for Caleb's attack.

4497
03:18:15,593 --> 03:18:16,690
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4498
03:18:16,690 --> 03:18:20,383
So, yeah, whatever Caleb does will be double damage.

4499
03:18:20,383 --> 03:18:21,280
MATT: Oh, for that one?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4500
03:18:21,280 --> 03:18:24,475
MATT: Does it say attack?
TALIESIN: It says the...

4501
03:18:25,577 --> 03:18:26,627
MATT: It does not function on spells

4502
03:18:26,627 --> 03:18:28,160
unless the spells have an attack roll.

4503
03:18:28,160 --> 03:18:29,410
TALIESIN: Oh. Okay, never mind, then.

4504
03:18:29,410 --> 03:18:30,243
I'm going to change my shit.

4505
03:18:30,243 --> 03:18:31,580
MATT: More of a combat-based thing,

4506
03:18:31,580 --> 03:18:34,510
or for spells that have an array

4507
03:18:34,510 --> 03:18:35,570
or have an attack roll involved.

4508
03:18:35,570 --> 03:18:38,103
TALIESIN: In that case, I'm going to

4509
03:18:38,103 --> 03:18:41,094
attempt to cast Bane, then,

4510
03:18:41,094 --> 03:18:42,640
on this thing, see if it sticks.

4511
03:18:42,640 --> 03:18:43,710
MATT: Okay. What's the save on that?

4512
03:18:43,710 --> 03:18:45,680
TALIESIN: 17.
MATT: 17 of which one?

4513
03:18:45,680 --> 03:18:47,547
TALIESIN: Charisma.
MATT: Charisma, ooh.

4514
03:18:49,530 --> 03:18:51,090
It rolled a natural 19, even though it doesn't have

4515
03:18:51,090 --> 03:18:54,160
a huge bonus on it, so it does resist Bane, unfortunately.

4516
03:18:55,010 --> 03:18:56,510
TALIESIN: It's all right.
MATT: Sorry.

4517
03:18:56,510 --> 03:18:58,080
That's your action.

4518
03:18:58,080 --> 03:19:00,290
TALIESIN: My bonus action was turn invisible, but--

4519
03:19:00,290 --> 03:19:02,020
MATT: Right, so that's your turn.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4520
03:19:02,020 --> 03:19:03,580
MATT: Right, finishing Caduceus. Fjord, you're up.

4521
03:19:03,580 --> 03:19:05,630
Beau, you're on deck for the top of the round.

4522
03:19:05,630 --> 03:19:07,800
TRAVIS: I'm going to kick off the ocean floor

4523
03:19:07,800 --> 03:19:12,620
and try and swim up behind this rock formation, trying to...

4524
03:19:14,213 --> 03:19:16,850
Is that 30 feet? Can I get there in 30 feet?

4525
03:19:16,850 --> 03:19:19,290
MATT: Yeah, five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. Yes, you can.

4526
03:19:19,290 --> 03:19:24,060
TRAVIS: Okay. Before I slink behind that little spire there

4527
03:19:24,060 --> 03:19:26,180
to break his line of sight with me, I'll fire--

4528
03:19:26,180 --> 03:19:27,770
MATT: You can't quite break his line of sight with 30 feet,

4529
03:19:27,770 --> 03:19:29,606
but you're right on the edge there.

4530
03:19:29,606 --> 03:19:34,060
TRAVIS: Okay. Then I may keep my head above.

4531
03:19:34,060 --> 03:19:35,650
I'll fire off two Eldritch Blasts

4532
03:19:35,650 --> 03:19:37,070
and then I'll drop down low

4533
03:19:37,070 --> 03:19:39,640
so that I'm behind that platform then,

4534
03:19:39,640 --> 03:19:42,673
just so that I can stay low.
MATT: Okay.

4535
03:19:42,673 --> 03:19:46,403
TRAVIS: Two Eldritch Blasts at him.
MATT: You got it.

4536
03:19:47,953 --> 03:19:49,760
TRAVIS: That's a 22 to hit.

4537
03:19:49,760 --> 03:19:52,190
MATT: That hits.
TRAVIS: Second one is...

4538
03:19:52,190 --> 03:19:54,300
Oh, that's really good. A 28.

4539
03:19:54,300 --> 03:19:57,840
MATT: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

4540
03:19:57,840 --> 03:20:02,840
TRAVIS: Eight plus five, plus two is 15.

4541
03:20:03,230 --> 03:20:06,763
15. That's total balls, but I can re-roll a one.

4542
03:20:10,033 --> 03:20:12,090
30 points of force damage.

4543
03:20:12,090 --> 03:20:13,140
SAM: Damn!
ASHLEY: Nice.

4544
03:20:13,140 --> 03:20:15,729
SAM: Of fjorce damage.
TRAVIS: Fjorce damage.

4545
03:20:15,729 --> 03:20:18,380
MATT: (laughs) And with that, you duck back down just below.

4546
03:20:18,380 --> 03:20:19,630
We'll say it'll put you about there.

4547
03:20:19,630 --> 03:20:21,432
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's great, yeah.

4548
03:20:21,432 --> 03:20:22,265
MATT: So you don't get quite as far,

4549
03:20:22,265 --> 03:20:23,230
but you use the rest of the movement

4550
03:20:23,230 --> 03:20:24,557
to get back down.
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

4551
03:20:24,557 --> 03:20:26,180
MATT: Is that your turn?
TRAVIS: It is.

4552
03:20:26,180 --> 03:20:28,160
Actually, I'm going to use my bonus
action before I duck down

4553
03:20:28,160 --> 03:20:31,420
to cast Hexblade's Curse on Vokodo.

4554
03:20:31,420 --> 03:20:32,930
You fucker!

4555
03:20:32,930 --> 03:20:34,863
MATT: With that, he has been cursed.
TALIESIN: We all need

4556
03:20:34,863 --> 03:20:38,105
convenient places to hang...

4557
03:20:38,105 --> 03:20:40,050
(laughter)

4558
03:20:40,050 --> 03:20:41,958
ASHLEY: Only a couple.

4559
03:20:41,958 --> 03:20:43,589
MATT: There's quite a few options there.

4560
03:20:43,589 --> 03:20:45,050
TALIESIN: A lot of coat hangers.
MATT: Okay.

4561
03:20:45,050 --> 03:20:46,970
That finishes your go, Fjord.

4562
03:20:46,970 --> 03:20:47,890
As you pull back behind,

4563
03:20:47,890 --> 03:20:52,065
you can watch as some of the long-dead

4564
03:20:53,506 --> 03:20:54,348
plant matter in here

4565
03:20:54,348 --> 03:20:57,990
begins to bloom green and then shoot out,

4566
03:20:57,990 --> 03:21:00,950
and sink into the crevices around its body

4567
03:21:00,950 --> 03:21:02,010
as the curse takes hold,

4568
03:21:02,010 --> 03:21:04,920
the Wild Mother now bound in there

4569
03:21:04,920 --> 03:21:06,635
with the Warlock energy.

4570
03:21:06,635 --> 03:21:08,300
TRAVIS: The Wild Mother has entered the fight.

4571
03:21:08,300 --> 03:21:10,210
MATT: Indeed. All right, Beau, you're up.

4572
03:21:10,210 --> 03:21:11,400
Caleb, you're on deck.

4573
03:21:11,400 --> 03:21:14,540
MARISHA: All right. I am going to wait

4574
03:21:14,540 --> 03:21:16,060
and rear up for my opportunity,

4575
03:21:16,060 --> 03:21:17,960
and as soon as I see one of his tentacles

4576
03:21:17,960 --> 03:21:20,080
whip overhead,

4577
03:21:20,080 --> 03:21:21,640
I'm going to leap and jump off.

4578
03:21:21,640 --> 03:21:23,910
I'm going to grab it swashbuckler-style,

4579
03:21:23,910 --> 03:21:26,770
and use that to swing around and come back at him

4580
03:21:26,770 --> 03:21:29,410
with a double donkey kick

4581
03:21:29,410 --> 03:21:30,937
to the face!
MATT: Around that side?

4582
03:21:30,937 --> 03:21:32,200
LAURA: Yeah!
MARISHA: Yeah!

4583
03:21:32,200 --> 03:21:33,540
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: That works great.

4584
03:21:33,540 --> 03:21:35,950
SAM: Is it all in slow motion because you're underwater?

4585
03:21:35,950 --> 03:21:38,960
MARISHA: Yeah, just--
(laughter)

4586
03:21:40,218 --> 03:21:41,920
MATT: Not for you, it's not slow motion.

4587
03:21:41,920 --> 03:21:43,900
(laughter)

4588
03:21:43,900 --> 03:21:46,960
MATT: As the tentacle rears back after the curse takes hold,

4589
03:21:46,960 --> 03:21:49,140
you grab it in this giant swoop,

4590
03:21:49,140 --> 03:21:51,590
and end up careening around--

4591
03:21:51,590 --> 03:21:53,960
MARISHA: Can I do a little bicycle kick, pop pop?

4592
03:21:53,960 --> 03:21:55,510
MATT: One bicycle kick to its side.

4593
03:21:56,883 --> 03:21:59,150
TRAVIS: ♪ Bicycle ♪
ALL: ♪ Bicycle ♪

4594
03:21:59,150 --> 03:22:04,150
MARISHA: That one's cocked, but this first one is 24.

4595
03:22:04,500 --> 03:22:06,210
MATT: That hits.
MARISHA: Stunning Strike.

4596
03:22:07,240 --> 03:22:10,320
God damn, that is shit dice rolls damage.

4597
03:22:10,320 --> 03:22:12,200
Seven damage.
MATT: Seven damage.

4598
03:22:13,090 --> 03:22:15,933
You take eight points of fire damage.

4599
03:22:15,933 --> 03:22:17,818
LAURA: Ugh.

4600
03:22:17,818 --> 03:22:21,040
MATT: Stunning Strike.
MARISHA: War of attrition right there.

4601
03:22:21,040 --> 03:22:22,860
MATT: It's going to go ahead and use another Resistance.

4602
03:22:22,860 --> 03:22:24,930
MARISHA: I have nothing to heal myself with.

4603
03:22:24,930 --> 03:22:25,800
TALIESIN: I mean, anything long-range--

4604
03:22:25,800 --> 03:22:27,360
MARISHA: He uses a Legendary Resistance?

4605
03:22:27,360 --> 03:22:28,584
LAURA: Yeah, he did.

4606
03:22:28,584 --> 03:22:29,572
TRAVIS: One.

4607
03:22:29,572 --> 03:22:32,222
He used one this round.
LIAM: He used one, at the top.

4608
03:22:35,250 --> 03:22:39,270
MATT: Yes he is. Yeah.
MARISHA: Okay. Okay.

4609
03:22:39,270 --> 03:22:41,060
TRAVIS: He's using another one?
MATT: Yes, he is.

4610
03:22:41,060 --> 03:22:41,893
TRAVIS: Okay.

4611
03:22:41,893 --> 03:22:43,892
MARISHA: So he's used two total?

4612
03:22:43,892 --> 03:22:44,967
Right? I think.

4613
03:22:44,967 --> 03:22:45,800
LAURA: Yeah.

4614
03:22:46,677 --> 03:22:47,510
That we know of.

4615
03:22:47,510 --> 03:22:48,482
SAM: He's used two?

4616
03:22:48,482 --> 03:22:50,160
MARISHA: He has used two.

4617
03:22:50,160 --> 03:22:51,872
MATT: I've seen some games where they don't even mention

4618
03:22:51,872 --> 03:22:53,490
if a Legendary Resistance is used.

4619
03:22:53,490 --> 03:22:54,950
They just let you guys figure it out.

4620
03:22:54,950 --> 03:22:56,122
But I don't know.

4621
03:22:56,122 --> 03:22:59,520
It's fun to let you guys strategize around it, so.

4622
03:22:59,520 --> 03:23:01,922
TRAVIS: Yeah, because our strategy's
paying off fucking well.

4623
03:23:01,922 --> 03:23:04,203
(laughter)

4624
03:23:04,203 --> 03:23:05,970
TALIESIN: A bunch of squirrels running around.
MARISHA: 15?

4625
03:23:05,970 --> 03:23:07,820
MATT: 15 misses it.
LAURA: Did we get it?!

4626
03:23:07,820 --> 03:23:09,080
Did we get it?!

4627
03:23:11,340 --> 03:23:12,773
MARISHA: 15 misses.

4628
03:23:14,197 --> 03:23:15,900
What did he do last time?

4629
03:23:15,900 --> 03:23:17,500
Okay. Yeah, you know what?

4630
03:23:17,500 --> 03:23:19,980
Flurry of Blows. I'm going to do pop pop again.

4631
03:23:19,980 --> 03:23:21,750
MATT: Go for it.
MARISHA: Shit, shit, shit.

4632
03:23:21,750 --> 03:23:24,170
Stop, D&D Beyond, stop--
SAM: Bob-ba-bob.

4633
03:23:24,170 --> 03:23:26,132
MARISHA: Bob.
TRAVIS: Ba-ba-bob.

4634
03:23:26,132 --> 03:23:28,100
MARISHA: So, while I'm there, I'm
going to try and swing around

4635
03:23:28,100 --> 03:23:31,152
for two more kicks to his little squirmy eyeballs.

4636
03:23:31,152 --> 03:23:33,620
Okay, okay.

4637
03:23:33,620 --> 03:23:36,510
28 for the first one, and 19.
MATT: Both of those hit.

4638
03:23:36,510 --> 03:23:38,714
MARISHA: All right.
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

4639
03:23:38,714 --> 03:23:40,380
MARISHA: Yeah.

4640
03:23:40,380 --> 03:23:42,960
LAURA: Is he stunned already?
MATT: No.

4641
03:23:42,960 --> 03:23:45,970
MARISHA: 13 damage for the first one.
MATT: All right.

4642
03:23:45,970 --> 03:23:48,100
MARISHA: And 11 damage for the second.

4643
03:23:48,100 --> 03:23:49,240
MATT: Great.
MARISHA: So it's 24 total.

4644
03:23:49,240 --> 03:23:52,130
MATT: You also take 14 points of fire damage.

4645
03:23:52,130 --> 03:23:53,560
MARISHA: Okay.
LAURA: Woof.

4646
03:23:53,560 --> 03:23:55,440
MATT: So after you've impacted both the legs,

4647
03:23:55,440 --> 03:23:57,030
you pull back and then, pop, pop!

4648
03:23:57,030 --> 03:23:58,790
Hit him back inside the side of the chest.

4649
03:23:58,790 --> 03:23:59,623
The whole side quivers,

4650
03:23:59,623 --> 03:24:01,190
and you see coins being jingled loose.

4651
03:24:01,190 --> 03:24:03,800
They begin to slowly fall and spin to the ground,

4652
03:24:04,760 --> 03:24:05,593
and as you pull back,

4653
03:24:05,593 --> 03:24:07,860
the knuckles are singed and burnt now.

4654
03:24:07,860 --> 03:24:09,820
You can see there's a little bit of blood trails

4655
03:24:09,820 --> 03:24:11,390
in the water as you pull back your fists.

4656
03:24:11,390 --> 03:24:12,930
You're starting to bleed from the impact there.
LAURA: Oh no, Beau!

4657
03:24:12,930 --> 03:24:15,590
MARISHA: Oh, they're getting those bubbly blisters.

4658
03:24:15,590 --> 03:24:16,847
SAM: Ew.
MARISHA: You know where they bubble?

4659
03:24:16,847 --> 03:24:19,139
SAM: Uh-huh.
MARISHA: Ah!

4660
03:24:19,139 --> 03:24:21,130
MATT: Does that finish your turn, Beauregard?

4661
03:24:21,130 --> 03:24:22,850
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. that does.
MATT: All right.

4662
03:24:22,850 --> 03:24:23,790
Caleb, you're up.
LIAM: Oh, yeah.

4663
03:24:23,790 --> 03:24:27,290
I'm going to swim 15 feet forward

4664
03:24:27,290 --> 03:24:31,660
and try to poke my face through that platform.

4665
03:24:31,660 --> 03:24:34,210
MATT: Over here?
LIAM: Yeah, that little gap there.

4666
03:24:34,210 --> 03:24:36,240
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: And extend my hand out,

4667
03:24:36,240 --> 03:24:38,550
holding a cocoon in my hand,

4668
03:24:38,550 --> 03:24:42,750
and I'm going to cast Polymorph on him, on Vokodo.

4669
03:24:42,750 --> 03:24:45,030
MATT: Okay, got it. That's a which save?

4670
03:24:45,030 --> 03:24:47,370
LIAM: That is a wisdom save.
MATT: Wisdom save.

4671
03:24:47,370 --> 03:24:49,450
SAM: And turn him into a dragon turtle.

4672
03:24:49,450 --> 03:24:51,812
MARISHA: (laughs)
MATT: That is a 23.

4673
03:24:51,812 --> 03:24:53,650
SAM: (groans)
LIAM: Big save.

4674
03:24:53,650 --> 03:24:55,260
MATT: Worth a try.

4675
03:24:55,260 --> 03:24:57,010
So as you come through and release it,

4676
03:24:57,010 --> 03:24:58,890
one of the eyes looks towards you,

4677
03:24:58,890 --> 03:24:59,940
and as the spell impacts,

4678
03:24:59,940 --> 03:25:01,610
you see its form quake for a second

4679
03:25:01,610 --> 03:25:03,800
and then resist it.

4680
03:25:07,140 --> 03:25:09,370
TRAVIS: Lair.
MATT: However.

4681
03:25:09,370 --> 03:25:10,953
Beauregard, I need you to make a wisdom save.

4682
03:25:10,953 --> 03:25:11,786
MARISHA: All right.

4683
03:25:13,070 --> 03:25:14,170
TRAVIS: C'mon, girl.

4684
03:25:14,170 --> 03:25:16,060
MARISHA: All right, all right, all right.

4685
03:25:16,060 --> 03:25:17,950
Cocked.

4686
03:25:17,950 --> 03:25:18,900
LIAM: Lure her out.

4687
03:25:18,900 --> 03:25:20,530
MARISHA: But that first one that wasn't cocked

4688
03:25:20,530 --> 03:25:23,065
was an 18 anyway, so 22.

4689
03:25:23,065 --> 03:25:24,720
MATT: 22, that does beat your DC.

4690
03:25:25,977 --> 03:25:28,600
SAM: What?
MATT: So as you cast Polymorph,

4691
03:25:28,600 --> 03:25:31,200
the effect blasts off his hide,

4692
03:25:31,200 --> 03:25:33,780
and then reforms towards Beauregard

4693
03:25:33,780 --> 03:25:37,050
and Beauregard, you suddenly resist an effect

4694
03:25:37,050 --> 03:25:39,020
that's maybe trying to change and alter

4695
03:25:39,020 --> 03:25:40,860
your physical form.

4696
03:25:40,860 --> 03:25:42,510
SAM: Wait, you resisted it also?

4697
03:25:42,510 --> 03:25:44,200
TRAVIS: Is that something that can happen,

4698
03:25:44,200 --> 03:25:46,170
that spell can ricochet off of a--?

4699
03:25:46,170 --> 03:25:49,600
MARISHA: With him? Is that with him?
LIAM: So she saved?

4700
03:25:49,600 --> 03:25:51,670
MARISHA: I saved.
LAURA: Oh, god.

4701
03:25:51,670 --> 03:25:53,570
MATT: And to that point, actually, just double-check.

4702
03:25:53,570 --> 03:25:55,170
MARISHA: This guy's got a lot of
tricks up his sleeve, you guys.

4703
03:25:55,170 --> 03:25:56,280
MATT: I forgot it earlier.

4704
03:25:56,280 --> 03:25:57,113
Caduceus, if you can go ahead

4705
03:25:57,113 --> 03:25:59,480
and make a charisma save for me.

4706
03:25:59,480 --> 03:26:00,700
LIAM: It would've been really funny

4707
03:26:00,700 --> 03:26:02,634
to see you turn into a giant crab, though.

4708
03:26:02,634 --> 03:26:06,170
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah. Pop pop!

4709
03:26:06,170 --> 03:26:08,090
TALIESIN: 20.
MATT: 20? Yeah, you're fine.

4710
03:26:08,090 --> 03:26:10,140
Cool. All right, Caleb.

4711
03:26:10,140 --> 03:26:11,360
That's your movement, that's your action.

4712
03:26:11,360 --> 03:26:12,577
LIAM: Yeah, done.
MATT: You good? All right, Caleb's done.

4713
03:26:12,577 --> 03:26:13,410
SAM: That's tricky.

4714
03:26:13,410 --> 03:26:15,977
MATT: We are now back to the lair action.
TRAVIS: Redirecting?

4715
03:26:15,977 --> 03:26:18,068
LAURA: That's tricksy.
TALIESIN: Oh, it's reflective.

4716
03:26:20,102 --> 03:26:23,450
MATT: As a lair action, he gets a free Misty Step

4717
03:26:23,450 --> 03:26:26,790
and is going to teleport 30 feet.

4718
03:26:27,870 --> 03:26:30,670
MARISHA: Wait, is he moving?
MATT: This way. As part of the lair action.

4719
03:26:30,670 --> 03:26:32,280
LIAM: Not a spell, it's a lair action, right?

4720
03:26:32,280 --> 03:26:33,270
TRAVIS: You got Sentry on his ass, right?

4721
03:26:33,270 --> 03:26:34,610
MATT: As a lair action,

4722
03:26:34,610 --> 03:26:36,070
it gets to cast, so it is a spell.

4723
03:26:36,070 --> 03:26:36,903
LIAM: Gets to cast?

4724
03:26:36,903 --> 03:26:39,240
MARISHA: But it's him leaving my melee range.

4725
03:26:39,240 --> 03:26:40,370
Do I still get to make an attack of opportunity?

4726
03:26:40,370 --> 03:26:41,860
MATT: It's a teleport, so no, you would not.

4727
03:26:41,860 --> 03:26:43,080
He just disappears.
TRAVIS: That's right.

4728
03:26:43,080 --> 03:26:44,840
LIAM: I'm not going to.
MATT: Okay.

4729
03:26:44,840 --> 03:26:46,330
LIAM: Not going to.
MATT: So with that,

4730
03:26:46,330 --> 03:26:49,300
leaving Beauregard and Yasha behind...

4731
03:26:50,360 --> 03:26:51,193
Oh, god.

4732
03:26:51,193 --> 03:26:52,322
ASHLEY: Beau!

4733
03:26:52,322 --> 03:26:55,080
MATT: And Beau falls over.
LAURA: Beau!

4734
03:26:55,080 --> 03:26:57,722
MARISHA: Slow-mo falling.
LAURA: "Oh, I can swim."

4735
03:26:57,722 --> 03:27:00,482
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

4736
03:27:00,482 --> 03:27:03,950
MARISHA: Ah--! Oh, it's fine. It's fine.

4737
03:27:03,950 --> 03:27:05,680
MATT: Teleports 30 feet back

4738
03:27:05,680 --> 03:27:06,513
as part of Misty Step.

4739
03:27:06,513 --> 03:27:08,270
You watch as he vanishes,

4740
03:27:08,270 --> 03:27:11,936
and then suddenly this tiny little sparkle of fire goes

4741
03:27:11,936 --> 03:27:14,019
across the water.
LAURA: Ooh.

4742
03:27:14,019 --> 03:27:15,450
MATT: All of a sudden he apparates in place again.

4743
03:27:15,450 --> 03:27:17,970
You watch all the water around him pull back

4744
03:27:17,970 --> 03:27:20,920
and then immediately begin to shift.

4745
03:27:20,920 --> 03:27:23,370
You can see the heat itself radiating

4746
03:27:23,370 --> 03:27:25,930
is causing the visuals around him to warp.

4747
03:27:27,160 --> 03:27:28,310
That's the lair action.

4748
03:27:29,740 --> 03:27:32,000
Now it comes to Vilya's turn.
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck.

4749
03:27:32,000 --> 03:27:34,190
MATT: So Vilya--
SAM: She's a orca.

4750
03:27:34,190 --> 03:27:35,840
TRAVIS: Killer whale.

4751
03:27:35,840 --> 03:27:37,098
MATT: So she can do quite well over here.
ASHLEY: When is he up?

4752
03:27:37,098 --> 03:27:38,650
When is Vokodo's turn?

4753
03:27:38,650 --> 03:27:39,483
LAURA: After Vilya.

4754
03:27:39,483 --> 03:27:40,630
SAM: Same time as Vilya.

4755
03:27:40,630 --> 03:27:42,170
TALIESIN: But still has to--

4756
03:27:42,170 --> 03:27:43,440
MATT: Range on Call Lightning is 120 feet,

4757
03:27:43,440 --> 03:27:45,440
so she can do it from there.

4758
03:27:45,440 --> 03:27:47,640
She's going to fly up a little higher,

4759
03:27:47,640 --> 03:27:51,400
or swim up as an orca, so she has a visual,

4760
03:27:51,400 --> 03:27:53,940
and is going to concentrate for a second.

4761
03:27:53,940 --> 03:27:55,190
The head seems to dip down

4762
03:27:55,190 --> 03:27:58,034
and the storm above goes (crackling, lightning striking)

4763
03:27:58,034 --> 03:28:00,750
and strikes down next towards Vokodo,

4764
03:28:00,750 --> 03:28:03,572
who fails his Dexterity saving throw.

4765
03:28:03,572 --> 03:28:04,670
SAM: Damn.

4766
03:28:09,216 --> 03:28:11,184
ASHLEY: (sighs)

4767
03:28:11,184 --> 03:28:13,351
LAURA: Yep.
SAM: How many dice is that?

4768
03:28:16,183 --> 03:28:19,560
MATT: 22, 25.

4769
03:28:19,560 --> 03:28:22,190
So 25 points of lightning damage to Vokodo

4770
03:28:22,190 --> 03:28:24,760
as the bolt strikes and hits him.

4771
03:28:24,760 --> 03:28:26,760
That's going to finish her go there.

4772
03:28:26,760 --> 03:28:28,780
TRAVIS: No redirecting of that spell?

4773
03:28:28,780 --> 03:28:29,613
MATT: No.

4774
03:28:31,420 --> 03:28:32,445
SAM: Good to know.

4775
03:28:35,651 --> 03:28:38,980
LAURA: It's an attack spell.

4776
03:28:38,980 --> 03:28:40,755
It's different.
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.

4777
03:28:40,755 --> 03:28:42,446
[intense music]

4778
03:28:42,446 --> 03:28:44,780
SAM: (humming to music)

4779
03:28:44,780 --> 03:28:46,990
TRAVIS: I'm still trying to figure out what's happening.

4780
03:28:46,990 --> 03:28:48,730
MATT: I did forget one thing earlier,

4781
03:28:48,730 --> 03:28:50,088
but it's my fault.

4782
03:28:51,110 --> 03:28:53,810
So finishing Vilya's turn, it's now Vokodo's turn.

4783
03:28:53,810 --> 03:28:57,520
The entire chamber has now become super heated.

4784
03:28:57,520 --> 03:29:00,633
Every one of you within the chamber

4785
03:29:00,633 --> 03:29:01,740
takes three points of fire damage.

4786
03:29:01,740 --> 03:29:04,240
SAM: Come on, Vokodo.

4787
03:29:04,240 --> 03:29:05,250
TRAVIS: Sam, shut up.

4788
03:29:05,250 --> 03:29:06,930
SAM: You got to do better than that, Vokodo!

4789
03:29:06,930 --> 03:29:07,900
LAURA: Don't!
TALIESIN: No.

4790
03:29:07,900 --> 03:29:09,770
We don't agree with that.
ASHLEY: Don't listen to him.

4791
03:29:09,770 --> 03:29:11,530
TRAVIS: He doesn't speak for us.

4792
03:29:11,530 --> 03:29:13,140
We want you to die, but--

4793
03:29:13,140 --> 03:29:15,095
MATT: At which point, while he's there,

4794
03:29:15,095 --> 03:29:17,550
he tumbles to the ground,

4795
03:29:17,550 --> 03:29:20,000
the successful Command causing him to grovel.

4796
03:29:20,000 --> 03:29:22,920
He swims to the base of the chamber, right there.

4797
03:29:22,920 --> 03:29:24,155
SAM: "You are super cool."

4798
03:29:24,155 --> 03:29:26,350
MATT: And it is currently prone.

4799
03:29:26,350 --> 03:29:27,570
SAM: Cool.
TRAVIS: Okay.

4800
03:29:27,570 --> 03:29:29,560
So does that mean melee attacks on it have advantage?

4801
03:29:29,560 --> 03:29:30,410
MATT: Advantage, yes.

4802
03:29:32,390 --> 03:29:33,890
That's going to go ahead and end his turn

4803
03:29:33,890 --> 03:29:34,940
since it's all he can do.

4804
03:29:34,940 --> 03:29:38,630
LAURA: Did the attacking Yasha break the charm on her,

4805
03:29:38,630 --> 03:29:40,970
because she took physical damage?

4806
03:29:40,970 --> 03:29:42,960
MATT: Ah, yes, go ahead and make another save.

4807
03:29:42,960 --> 03:29:44,640
LAURA: But wouldn't it break it already?

4808
03:29:44,640 --> 03:29:46,350
MATT: Doesn't break it. She gets to save.

4809
03:29:46,350 --> 03:29:47,700
LIAM: She gets a save because of it.

4810
03:29:47,700 --> 03:29:48,910
LAURA: Okay.
ASHLEY: Come on. Big money.

4811
03:29:48,910 --> 03:29:51,110
TRAVIS: You get a wisdom save with advantage, right?

4812
03:29:52,050 --> 03:29:52,883
ASHLEY: Say again?

4813
03:29:52,883 --> 03:29:56,130
LIAM: Wisdom advantage, yeah.
ASHLEY: Goddamn it.

4814
03:29:57,211 --> 03:29:58,350
MATT: No?

4815
03:29:58,350 --> 03:29:59,800
ASHLEY: 12.
MATT: 12, no.

4816
03:29:59,800 --> 03:30:02,620
You're still there staring forward towards it.

4817
03:30:02,620 --> 03:30:04,340
ASHLEY: How fun.
MATT: That ends Vokodo's turn,

4818
03:30:04,340 --> 03:30:05,330
currently prone on the ground,

4819
03:30:05,330 --> 03:30:08,075
Commanded by a level one spell.

4820
03:30:08,075 --> 03:30:10,100
TRAVIS: (laughs)

4821
03:30:10,100 --> 03:30:11,940
MATT: Ending that go, Yasha, it's your turn,

4822
03:30:11,940 --> 03:30:15,410
and you spend your turn dashing as close as you can,

4823
03:30:15,410 --> 03:30:16,710
right there, staring once more

4824
03:30:16,710 --> 03:30:18,260
into the dead lights of Vokodo,

4825
03:30:19,100 --> 03:30:20,000
as Marisha put it.

4826
03:30:21,530 --> 03:30:24,270
Absorbed by what's in front of you,

4827
03:30:25,110 --> 03:30:28,381
eyes wide, hypnotized.
ASHLEY: Try again, though.

4828
03:30:28,381 --> 03:30:29,214
MATT: At the end of your turn,

4829
03:30:29,214 --> 03:30:30,047
you can make another series of saves.

4830
03:30:30,047 --> 03:30:32,130
TRAVIS, ASHLEY, and MARISHA: Come on.

4831
03:30:32,130 --> 03:30:34,060
MARISHA: With advantage.
ASHLEY: Gosh dang it!

4832
03:30:34,060 --> 03:30:35,070
TRAVIS: Come on, here we go. This is it.

4833
03:30:35,070 --> 03:30:38,160
MARISHA: This is the one.
ASHLEY: No, it's not! It's a five.

4834
03:30:38,160 --> 03:30:40,013
MARISHA: What?
SAM: (laughs)

4835
03:30:40,013 --> 03:30:42,525
ASHLEY: Ugh, that was advantage!

4836
03:30:43,690 --> 03:30:46,240
MATT: All right, that brings us to

4837
03:30:47,973 --> 03:30:49,830
Jester, with Veth on deck.

4838
03:30:49,830 --> 03:30:52,650
SAM: Oh, I got to come up with something.

4839
03:30:52,650 --> 03:30:55,650
ASHLEY: I'm rolling bad.
LAURA: Okay.

4840
03:30:57,230 --> 03:31:01,500
LAURA: I'm going to have my duplicate swim towards him.

4841
03:31:01,500 --> 03:31:02,550
MATT: Okay.

4842
03:31:02,550 --> 03:31:04,910
LAURA: How close can she get?

4843
03:31:04,910 --> 03:31:06,920
MATT: She can, because she's not altered

4844
03:31:06,920 --> 03:31:08,270
by the speed of the water,

4845
03:31:08,270 --> 03:31:12,153
she can get almost 10 feet away.

4846
03:31:14,030 --> 03:31:15,800
LIAM: (as Jester) Diplomatic immunity.
MATT: (counting)

4847
03:31:15,800 --> 03:31:17,280
Yeah, so 30 feet.

4848
03:31:17,280 --> 03:31:19,430
It's still five feet away.
TRAVIS: Where's Yasha?

4849
03:31:19,430 --> 03:31:20,920
LAURA: I'm scared of casting any spells.

4850
03:31:20,920 --> 03:31:22,736
I'm afraid it's going to--

4851
03:31:23,686 --> 03:31:24,950
LIAM: Right?

4852
03:31:24,950 --> 03:31:26,583
LAURA: I'm going to try to cast--

4853
03:31:27,555 --> 03:31:28,846
Fuck!

4854
03:31:28,846 --> 03:31:31,423
TRAVIS: I don't know that spell.

4855
03:31:31,423 --> 03:31:33,040
LAURA: (laughs)
MATT: I think you do.

4856
03:31:33,040 --> 03:31:34,140
TRAVIS: Matt, can you point to where Yasha is?

4857
03:31:34,140 --> 03:31:35,680
SAM: Fuck him!
MATT: Right there.

4858
03:31:35,680 --> 03:31:36,513
TRAVIS: Got it.

4859
03:31:36,513 --> 03:31:37,530
MATT: Right in the front of the face,

4860
03:31:37,530 --> 03:31:39,180
just staring into the open mouth.

4861
03:31:40,063 --> 03:31:44,213
LIAM: (growling)

4862
03:31:47,050 --> 03:31:50,780
LAURA: I'm going to cast Command again.

4863
03:31:50,780 --> 03:31:51,900
MATT: Cast Command again? Okay.

4864
03:31:51,900 --> 03:31:54,020
What's the save on that? That's wisdom?

4865
03:31:54,020 --> 03:31:55,750
LAURA: Yeah.

4866
03:31:55,750 --> 03:31:57,333
MATT: That is going to be a 19.

4867
03:31:58,210 --> 03:32:00,070
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: Yeah. That succeeds.

4868
03:32:00,070 --> 03:32:02,100
That's your action, and your bonus to move it,

4869
03:32:02,100 --> 03:32:05,010
so you have your movement still if you want to move at all.

4870
03:32:05,010 --> 03:32:06,640
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to swim around--

4871
03:32:07,697 --> 03:32:09,089
(babbling)

4872
03:32:09,089 --> 03:32:12,272
the base of where Fjord is.

4873
03:32:12,272 --> 03:32:13,180
MATT: Okay.

4874
03:32:13,180 --> 03:32:16,210
LAURA: I'm going to swim as far around it as I can.

4875
03:32:16,210 --> 03:32:17,043
MATT: That's as far as you can get,

4876
03:32:17,043 --> 03:32:18,510
unless you want to go up or down.

4877
03:32:18,510 --> 03:32:21,097
LAURA: I'm going to stay up so I can see him

4878
03:32:21,097 --> 03:32:24,680
just above the edge of that--

4879
03:32:24,680 --> 03:32:25,513
Yeah, I can't.

4880
03:32:25,513 --> 03:32:27,496
MATT: That's all good. I'll put you--

4881
03:32:27,496 --> 03:32:29,630
LAURA: I think he won't get over there.

4882
03:32:29,630 --> 03:32:32,396
MATT: Put you right there.

4883
03:32:32,396 --> 03:32:33,722
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4884
03:32:33,722 --> 03:32:36,070
MATT: So you're just peeking over the edge.

4885
03:32:36,070 --> 03:32:37,850
You've got it. All right, that finishes Jester's go.

4886
03:32:37,850 --> 03:32:40,290
Veth, you're up. Caduceus, you're on deck.

4887
03:32:40,290 --> 03:32:42,343
SAM: What do I do?

4888
03:32:42,343 --> 03:32:45,410
Oh, what do I do?

4889
03:32:45,410 --> 03:32:46,930
I got to get within 30 feet,

4890
03:32:46,930 --> 03:32:49,090
but he's moved 30 feet away,

4891
03:32:50,670 --> 03:32:53,090
and I can only swim 15 feet, right?

4892
03:32:53,090 --> 03:32:55,240
MATT: Correct.
LAURA: Did I need to make a wisdom save or something

4893
03:32:55,240 --> 03:32:57,900
to make sure it didn't do anything to somebody else?

4894
03:32:59,050 --> 03:32:59,950
The Command spell?

4895
03:33:00,810 --> 03:33:02,730
MATT: No, you don't have to make a wisdom save.

4896
03:33:06,820 --> 03:33:07,653
Beauregard does.

4897
03:33:07,653 --> 03:33:08,870
LIAM: Yeah.

4898
03:33:08,870 --> 03:33:09,703
MARISHA: What?
MATT: Make a wisdom save.

4899
03:33:09,703 --> 03:33:11,800
LIAM: You're getting a ricochet spell again.

4900
03:33:11,800 --> 03:33:14,633
MARISHA: Oh, shit, okay.
TALIESIN: With advantage.

4901
03:33:16,200 --> 03:33:18,140
MARISHA: Wisdom save?
MATT: Mm-hmm.

4902
03:33:19,830 --> 03:33:22,020
MARISHA: 13 plus four.
LAURA: 17?

4903
03:33:22,020 --> 03:33:24,700
MARISHA: Is 17.
LAURA: So you succeed, 17.

4904
03:33:24,700 --> 03:33:26,110
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.

4905
03:33:26,110 --> 03:33:27,260
MATT: Jester was about to shout a word,

4906
03:33:27,260 --> 03:33:29,380
and for a second your concentration shifts towards her,

4907
03:33:29,380 --> 03:33:31,470
and you shake it from your will.

4908
03:33:32,860 --> 03:33:33,935
MARISHA: Grovel? Really?

4909
03:33:33,935 --> 03:33:35,018
You want me to grovel right now?

4910
03:33:35,018 --> 03:33:36,430
LAURA: No, no, I wasn't going to say grovel!

4911
03:33:36,430 --> 03:33:38,523
MARISHA: Oh. Okay.

4912
03:33:38,523 --> 03:33:42,150
MATT: All right. So, Veth?
LIAM: "Beg!"

4913
03:33:42,150 --> 03:33:43,210
SAM: I'm going to swim.

4914
03:33:43,210 --> 03:33:47,670
I can't get within range, so I will--

4915
03:33:47,670 --> 03:33:49,290
Can I make it up to that thing

4916
03:33:49,290 --> 03:33:50,810
that Fjord was behind before?

4917
03:33:50,810 --> 03:33:53,833
MATT: Up here?
SAM: That rock that-- yeah.

4918
03:33:53,833 --> 03:33:55,440
MATT: Right on top here, you mean?

4919
03:33:55,440 --> 03:33:56,350
SAM: Yeah, yeah.

4920
03:33:56,350 --> 03:33:57,991
Can I get behind that?

4921
03:33:57,991 --> 03:33:59,800
MATT: You can get over here

4922
03:33:59,800 --> 03:34:00,720
is about as far as you can get,

4923
03:34:00,720 --> 03:34:03,607
which is partial cover.
SAM: Okay, that's fine.

4924
03:34:03,607 --> 03:34:06,410
Can I hide behind something over there?

4925
03:34:06,410 --> 03:34:07,280
MATT: Yeah, you can try and hide there.

4926
03:34:07,280 --> 03:34:09,150
SAM: All right, I'll bonus action hide.

4927
03:34:09,150 --> 03:34:11,170
MATT: All righty.

4928
03:34:11,170 --> 03:34:12,460
SAM: And then I will--
MATT: Roll a stealth check.

4929
03:34:12,460 --> 03:34:13,958
SAM: Oh, yeah, I have to stealth.

4930
03:34:13,958 --> 03:34:16,120
Stealth, stealth...

4931
03:34:19,220 --> 03:34:20,053
30.

4932
03:34:20,053 --> 03:34:20,886
MATT: Okay.

4933
03:34:21,750 --> 03:34:25,138
SAM: And then from my hidden position,

4934
03:34:25,138 --> 03:34:27,420
I will cast a spell at it,

4935
03:34:28,310 --> 03:34:30,830
using my Spell Sniper.

4936
03:34:30,830 --> 03:34:33,760
Is that a thing? Not Spell Sniper.

4937
03:34:33,760 --> 03:34:34,687
It's like--

4938
03:34:36,280 --> 03:34:37,680
I've never done this before.

4939
03:34:39,260 --> 03:34:40,580
Magical Ambush!

4940
03:34:41,540 --> 03:34:43,310
If I'm hidden when I cast a spell,

4941
03:34:43,310 --> 03:34:45,840
the creature has disadvantage on saving throw.

4942
03:34:46,690 --> 03:34:48,890
TALIESIN: Ooh.
MATT: That's true.

4943
03:34:48,890 --> 03:34:52,327
MARISHA: Wow. Wow, you haven't ever done that.

4944
03:34:52,327 --> 03:34:53,470
MATT: Yeah.

4945
03:34:53,470 --> 03:34:56,020
ASHLEY: Disadvantage on saving throws for the rest of the--

4946
03:34:56,020 --> 03:34:58,110
SAM: No, just for this.
MATT: Just against that spell.

4947
03:34:58,110 --> 03:35:03,110
SAM: So I will cast Phantasmal Force on It,
MATT: Okay.

4948
03:35:03,376 --> 03:35:05,270
LAURA: Ooh, maybe he's extra-susceptible to it

4949
03:35:05,270 --> 03:35:07,460
since all he does is communicate with mind images.

4950
03:35:07,460 --> 03:35:08,510
TALIESIN: Could be.

4951
03:35:09,350 --> 03:35:11,380
MATT: So what is the DC on that,
and what kind of save is it?

4952
03:35:11,380 --> 03:35:12,720
Is it wisdom?
SAM: Only 15.

4953
03:35:12,720 --> 03:35:14,950
MARISHA: Just flood the channels.

4954
03:35:14,950 --> 03:35:18,190
SAM: And it is Intelligence.
MATT: Intelligence.

4955
03:35:18,190 --> 03:35:19,357
Okay.

4956
03:35:22,460 --> 03:35:25,350
Okay, so rolled an 18, and the lower number,

4957
03:35:25,350 --> 03:35:27,330
with its bonus, is a 14.
LAURA: (gasps)

4958
03:35:27,330 --> 03:35:28,780
SAM: So it failed.
MATT: It failed.

4959
03:35:30,120 --> 03:35:32,350
So what's the effect?

4960
03:35:32,350 --> 03:35:36,472
SAM: Well, not much, because I'm just a little creepy thing.

4961
03:35:37,696 --> 03:35:41,771
So it will see a giant black portal,

4962
03:35:41,771 --> 03:35:43,240
10 feet wide

4963
03:35:43,240 --> 03:35:45,750
open up in front of it,

4964
03:35:45,750 --> 03:35:49,140
accompanied by the sound of nightmarish howls

4965
03:35:49,140 --> 03:35:51,653
from an Abyss-like plane,

4966
03:35:51,653 --> 03:35:55,070
so it's like (warped growling)

4967
03:35:55,070 --> 03:35:57,650
and it will hear, in Common, anyway,

4968
03:35:57,650 --> 03:36:00,960
"I'm coming for you!"

4969
03:36:00,960 --> 03:36:02,430
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Oh, god.

4970
03:36:02,430 --> 03:36:06,870
MATT: All right. Okay. Does it take any damage from this?

4971
03:36:06,870 --> 03:36:08,670
SAM: It could take--

4972
03:36:08,670 --> 03:36:11,320
It can take psychic damage, maybe?

4973
03:36:11,320 --> 03:36:13,040
MATT: I mean, does the spell do damage?

4974
03:36:13,040 --> 03:36:15,190
SAM: Oh, yeah, but it seems to--

4975
03:36:16,380 --> 03:36:19,970
It says if the effect seems like it would injure them,

4976
03:36:19,970 --> 03:36:21,790
they can take a 1d6--
MATT: Right.

4977
03:36:21,790 --> 03:36:23,950
So there's no damage yet.
SAM: No, it doesn't seem like it.

4978
03:36:23,950 --> 03:36:25,580
MATT: Okay, you got it.

4979
03:36:25,580 --> 03:36:27,100
Okay, that finishes your go.

4980
03:36:27,100 --> 03:36:28,452
LIAM: You are not a little creepy thing--

4981
03:36:28,452 --> 03:36:29,758
ASHLEY: That's cool.
LAURA: That was cool!

4982
03:36:29,758 --> 03:36:31,742
LIAM: -- you are a strong halfling woman.
MATT: I will say...

4983
03:36:33,670 --> 03:36:35,000
No, I mean, it failed the save,

4984
03:36:35,000 --> 03:36:37,650
so it believes the scenario.

4985
03:36:37,650 --> 03:36:40,490
So, you watch as it's on the ground,

4986
03:36:40,490 --> 03:36:41,990
getting up from its groveling,

4987
03:36:43,180 --> 03:36:44,770
in the process of getting up.

4988
03:36:44,770 --> 03:36:46,880
It's angry, it's frustrated.

4989
03:36:46,880 --> 03:36:49,120
It sees Yasha there, just grinning at that process,

4990
03:36:49,120 --> 03:36:51,678
and now that it's moved away
from the one that's pinning it down

4991
03:36:51,678 --> 03:36:53,240
and everyone's hiding over there,

4992
03:36:53,240 --> 03:36:56,840
you see the weird tongue on the inside of the mouth

4993
03:36:56,840 --> 03:36:59,313
comes out and licks the front
of its teeth looking at Yasha,

4994
03:36:59,313 --> 03:37:02,670
and you can see the tongue itself
is glowing this extremely bright,

4995
03:37:02,670 --> 03:37:07,240
almost like orange-ish yellow
hot poker iron type coloration

4996
03:37:07,240 --> 03:37:08,340
as it pulls across the front.

4997
03:37:08,340 --> 03:37:10,360
As it does, you can see bubbles rise

4998
03:37:10,360 --> 03:37:11,738
as the water in its immediate vicinity

4999
03:37:11,738 --> 03:37:16,510
flash vapors and bubbles up into the darkness above.

5000
03:37:16,510 --> 03:37:19,170
Then suddenly it sees something

5001
03:37:19,170 --> 03:37:20,980
out of the corner of its eyes.

5002
03:37:20,980 --> 03:37:23,365
The eyes shoot there, and its entire body goes--

5003
03:37:23,365 --> 03:37:25,500
(snarling)

5004
03:37:25,500 --> 03:37:27,120
and you can see fear on its face.

5005
03:37:27,120 --> 03:37:28,500
LAURA: Ooh!
SAM: Right, right.

5006
03:37:29,953 --> 03:37:31,670
MATT: Does it get to save every round?

5007
03:37:31,670 --> 03:37:33,094
SAM: I'll look.

5008
03:37:33,094 --> 03:37:34,744
MARISHA: Wow. Okay.

5009
03:37:37,710 --> 03:37:39,220
SAM: "While the target is affected by the spell..."

5010
03:37:39,220 --> 03:37:40,053
Blah blah blah blah.

5011
03:37:40,053 --> 03:37:42,005
MATT: You're concentrating on that.

5012
03:37:42,005 --> 03:37:45,350
Oh, we have concentration here as well.

5013
03:37:45,350 --> 03:37:47,460
Okay. You got that?

5014
03:37:47,460 --> 03:37:49,890
Veth, that's your turn. Caduceus, you're up.

5015
03:37:49,890 --> 03:37:50,990
Fjord, you're on deck.

5016
03:37:51,870 --> 03:37:53,710
TALIESIN: How far forward would I have to walk

5017
03:37:53,710 --> 03:37:56,580
to be within 30 feet of Yasha?

5018
03:37:56,580 --> 03:38:00,163
MATT: To be within 30 feet of Yasha
from where you are, which is--

5019
03:38:00,163 --> 03:38:01,859
TALIESIN: I'm invisible right there.
MATT: Right there?

5020
03:38:01,859 --> 03:38:03,054
TALIESIN: Although I'd be visible now.

5021
03:38:03,054 --> 03:38:05,870
MATT: You would be. Put it right there.

5022
03:38:05,870 --> 03:38:07,940
You would need to go your full movement,

5023
03:38:07,940 --> 03:38:09,707
or close to it. 10 feet.

5024
03:38:12,940 --> 03:38:15,340
TALIESIN: Okay. I'll do--

5025
03:38:15,340 --> 03:38:17,556
I'm going to try and get as centered as I am

5026
03:38:17,556 --> 03:38:21,120
to get everyone-- as many people,
within a 30-foot radius, as possible.

5027
03:38:21,120 --> 03:38:22,210
MATT: That'd be right there.

5028
03:38:22,210 --> 03:38:24,727
TALIESIN: And do I get Beau in that?
MATT: Possibly.

5029
03:38:27,075 --> 03:38:28,250
TALIESIN: (groaning)

5030
03:38:28,250 --> 03:38:30,840
SAM: Matty, it says that it can use its action

5031
03:38:30,840 --> 03:38:33,030
to investigate it.
MATT: Got it.

5032
03:38:33,030 --> 03:38:33,863
LIAM: Ash.

5033
03:38:33,863 --> 03:38:35,920
TALIESIN: Who's within range--?

5034
03:38:35,920 --> 03:38:38,710
Just, I mean, it's one of those things where I'm...

5035
03:38:38,710 --> 03:38:41,422
How many people do I think are in range?

5036
03:38:41,422 --> 03:38:42,255
MARISHA: (laughs)

5037
03:38:42,255 --> 03:38:44,410
MATT: You think everybody could possibly be in range,

5038
03:38:44,410 --> 03:38:46,600
but you wouldn't know until you actually check.

5039
03:38:46,600 --> 03:38:48,128
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to cast then at...

5040
03:38:48,128 --> 03:38:51,540
LIAM: I'm just a Barbarian.
ASHLEY: With advantage.

5041
03:38:51,540 --> 03:38:53,870
MARISHA: Poor Barbarians getting mind controlled.

5042
03:38:53,870 --> 03:38:54,878
TALIESIN: Sorry, one second.

5043
03:38:54,878 --> 03:38:57,602
LIAM: I mean, Grog got mind controlled all the time.
MARISHA: All the time, yeah.

5044
03:38:57,602 --> 03:39:00,660
MATT: It's that low Wisdom, man.
MARISHA: It's true. (laughs)

5045
03:39:00,660 --> 03:39:03,470
ASHLEY: Yeah.
LIAM: "Must kill my friends."

5046
03:39:03,470 --> 03:39:04,755
MATT: What are you doing, Caduceus?

5047
03:39:04,755 --> 03:39:07,890
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and cast this on six people.

5048
03:39:07,890 --> 03:39:09,940
I'm casting Bless on six people.

5049
03:39:09,940 --> 03:39:11,427
ASHLEY: Whoa.
MATT: Casting at what level?

5050
03:39:11,427 --> 03:39:13,997
TALIESIN: That would be level four.
MATT: Okay.

5051
03:39:16,808 --> 03:39:20,242
So, 30 feet, Beauregard is definitely in that way.

5052
03:39:20,242 --> 03:39:21,633
Yasha's definitely in there.

5053
03:39:21,633 --> 03:39:24,050
TALIESIN: Yeah, I was hoping to go one step diagonal

5054
03:39:24,050 --> 03:39:26,000
or two step diagonal just to get a little closer to Beau

5055
03:39:26,000 --> 03:39:31,000
and be not right behind phantom Jester.

5056
03:39:31,430 --> 03:39:33,785
MATT: One step back, okay.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5057
03:39:33,785 --> 03:39:36,335
I mean one step, that diagonal.
MATT: There?

5058
03:39:36,335 --> 03:39:38,654
TALIESIN: No, the other way. The other way. Yeah, there.

5059
03:39:38,654 --> 03:39:39,487
MATT: Okay.

5060
03:39:39,487 --> 03:39:41,920
So moving there, you get everybody except for Jester.

5061
03:39:41,920 --> 03:39:44,530
TALIESIN: That's okay.
MATT: So, who are you choosing?

5062
03:39:44,530 --> 03:39:46,620
TALIESIN: Yeah. That's six.

5063
03:39:46,620 --> 03:39:51,436
So one, two, three, four,

5064
03:39:51,436 --> 03:39:53,602
five, six.

5065
03:39:55,590 --> 03:39:58,970
So, everyone has a d4 added to saves and attacks.

5066
03:39:58,970 --> 03:40:00,330
ASHLEY: Yes.
MARISHA: Are we Blessed?

5067
03:40:00,330 --> 03:40:01,590
TALIESIN: Yep.
ASHLEY: Thank you.

5068
03:40:01,590 --> 03:40:03,700
SAM: Me too?
TALIESIN: Except Jester.

5069
03:40:03,700 --> 03:40:07,327
LAURA: That's okay.
TALIESIN: Yeah. It was either you... yeah.

5070
03:40:07,327 --> 03:40:08,160
MATT: And yourself?

5071
03:40:08,160 --> 03:40:08,993
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5072
03:40:10,330 --> 03:40:12,723
LIAM: At least she's Jester though.
TALIESIN: That's true.

5073
03:40:12,723 --> 03:40:15,130
TRAVIS: That's a d4 to Wisdom saving throws?
LAURA: I'm still smiling, even though I'm going to die.

5074
03:40:15,130 --> 03:40:17,310
MATT: Every saving throw, every attack. Right?

5075
03:40:17,310 --> 03:40:19,760
MARISHA: Attacks and saves.
TALIESIN: Attacks and saves have a d4.

5076
03:40:19,760 --> 03:40:21,253
MATT: Everybody is Blessed. You got it.

5077
03:40:21,253 --> 03:40:23,300
That finish your turn, Caduceus?

5078
03:40:23,300 --> 03:40:24,910
TALIESIN: Yep, that's what I got.

5079
03:40:24,910 --> 03:40:26,920
MATT: Fjord, you're up.
TALIESIN: Don't like where I am,

5080
03:40:26,920 --> 03:40:28,630
but what am I going to do?
TRAVIS: Okay.

5081
03:40:28,630 --> 03:40:32,000
I'm going to float up from behind the platform,

5082
03:40:32,000 --> 03:40:34,450
only so that my eyes crest the top

5083
03:40:34,450 --> 03:40:36,340
so that I can see.
MATT: Okay.

5084
03:40:36,340 --> 03:40:39,900
TRAVIS: And I am going to spot the portal

5085
03:40:39,900 --> 03:40:42,300
that is being conjured by Nott.

5086
03:40:42,300 --> 03:40:45,964
MATT: You don't see a portal.
You have no idea what's happening.

5087
03:40:45,964 --> 03:40:48,014
TRAVIS: Oh.
MATT: It isn't an illusion to everybody.

5088
03:40:48,014 --> 03:40:49,390
It's a vision that he's having.

5089
03:40:49,390 --> 03:40:51,623
TRAVIS: Oh.
MATT: So you have no idea what Veth did.

5090
03:40:51,623 --> 03:40:54,027
TRAVIS: Can I track where his eyes are cowering from?

5091
03:40:55,370 --> 03:40:57,540
MATT: Make an Insight check.
TRAVIS: Okay.

5092
03:40:57,540 --> 03:40:59,891
ASHLEY: Come on.

5093
03:41:01,374 --> 03:41:03,040
TRAVIS: (groaning) Not great.

5094
03:41:04,049 --> 03:41:05,498
Six.
MATT: No, you have no idea.

5095
03:41:05,498 --> 03:41:06,970
You don't even know he's afraid.

5096
03:41:06,970 --> 03:41:08,778
As far as you know--
SAM: Damn it!

5097
03:41:08,778 --> 03:41:10,857
MATT: -- it's just on the ground
groveling and getting up, so.

5098
03:41:10,857 --> 03:41:13,680
LIAM: He could have pulled a barlgura through the illusion.

5099
03:41:13,680 --> 03:41:15,460
MARISHA: That's so fucking cool.
SAM: That's what we had texted about,

5100
03:41:15,460 --> 03:41:18,831
but I guess I never in-game told him what I was doing.

5101
03:41:18,831 --> 03:41:20,360
(laughter)

5102
03:41:20,360 --> 03:41:21,801
TRAVIS: Yeah.

5103
03:41:21,801 --> 03:41:22,868
It was what I said I was going to do

5104
03:41:22,868 --> 03:41:24,652
before the fight, though.
SAM: It is.

5105
03:41:27,510 --> 03:41:29,680
TALIESIN: Would you have done it anyway, is the question?

5106
03:41:29,680 --> 03:41:32,214
SAM: Fjord, I made an illusion like we discussed!

5107
03:41:32,214 --> 03:41:35,300
(laughter)

5108
03:41:35,300 --> 03:41:38,218
Like we texted about a minute ago.

5109
03:41:38,218 --> 03:41:40,720
LAURA: Here.
SAM: You can reply to this message.

5110
03:41:42,170 --> 03:41:43,302
Okay. Uh--

5111
03:41:44,602 --> 03:41:46,952
TALIESIN: I don't even know.
TRAVIS: I don't want to be all meta about it.

5112
03:41:48,655 --> 03:41:49,891
MATT: What are you doing, Fjord?

5113
03:41:49,891 --> 03:41:51,613
TRAVIS: (inhales sharply)
LIAM: Put him in prison. Meta prison.

5114
03:41:51,613 --> 03:41:53,130
TALIESIN: I've been wondering why you haven't pulled anything out.

5115
03:41:53,130 --> 03:41:54,080
LAURA: Yeah, you were going to do it.

5116
03:41:54,080 --> 03:41:55,420
TRAVIS: Fuck it!
LAURA: Just do it.

5117
03:41:55,420 --> 03:41:57,678
You just won't know where to do it from.

5118
03:41:57,678 --> 03:42:00,300
MARISHA: That's true.
TRAVIS: In this area,

5119
03:42:01,370 --> 03:42:03,200
because it's the biggest open space,

5120
03:42:04,720 --> 03:42:08,400
I'm going to use Major Image, and I'm going to conjure

5121
03:42:08,400 --> 03:42:13,400
a 20-foot by 20-foot Astral dreadnought.

5122
03:42:13,620 --> 03:42:16,690
MARISHA: Yes!
TRAVIS: That looks like it's burning

5123
03:42:16,690 --> 03:42:18,758
with the same sort of glowing fire

5124
03:42:18,758 --> 03:42:20,550
that Vokodo has.

5125
03:42:20,550 --> 03:42:22,460
MATT: Whereabouts?

5126
03:42:22,460 --> 03:42:23,750
TRAVIS: Yeah, kind of over...

5127
03:42:23,750 --> 03:42:25,183
Yeah, right about there.

5128
03:42:27,258 --> 03:42:28,091
MATT: Okay.

5129
03:42:28,091 --> 03:42:31,380
TRAVIS: Maybe a little closer to where I actually am.

5130
03:42:31,380 --> 03:42:34,260
Just so that it pushes him back towards you

5131
03:42:34,260 --> 03:42:35,700
and away from most of us.

5132
03:42:35,700 --> 03:42:37,040
MATT: So, about there?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

5133
03:42:37,040 --> 03:42:37,873
MATT: Okay.

5134
03:42:40,931 --> 03:42:42,810
Major Image, there we go.

5135
03:42:42,810 --> 03:42:45,768
TRAVIS: 120 feet range, 20 by 20 cube.

5136
03:42:45,768 --> 03:42:49,650
It makes sounds, looks terrifying...

5137
03:42:51,860 --> 03:42:53,226
MATT: Totally.

5138
03:42:53,226 --> 03:42:55,292
LIAM: How-- for comparison,

5139
03:42:55,292 --> 03:42:57,790
how big was the astral dreadnought

5140
03:42:57,790 --> 03:43:00,480
that we went into the mouth of?

5141
03:43:00,480 --> 03:43:01,831
MATT: The astral dreadnought that you went in the mouth of?

5142
03:43:01,831 --> 03:43:02,664
LIAM: Yeah.

5143
03:43:02,664 --> 03:43:05,620
MATT: Was between 20 and 25 feet wide on any side.

5144
03:43:05,620 --> 03:43:06,453
LIAM: Okay, great.
LAURA: Okay.

5145
03:43:06,453 --> 03:43:09,000
MATT: So, much larger than him.
SAM: It's a juvenile.

5146
03:43:09,000 --> 03:43:11,092
TRAVIS: He's a runt.
MATT: Or a little bit larger than him.

5147
03:43:11,092 --> 03:43:13,600
MARISHA: Or, once again, just very far away.

5148
03:43:13,600 --> 03:43:14,654
SAM: That's right.
LIAM: Right.

5149
03:43:14,654 --> 03:43:15,860
SAM: (laughs)
MATT: Okay.

5150
03:43:15,860 --> 03:43:19,030
SAM: Water distorts...
MATT: You create that illusion.

5151
03:43:19,030 --> 03:43:20,820
MARISHA: The heat...
MATT: It's resting there.

5152
03:43:21,740 --> 03:43:23,870
Is that your turn?
TRAVIS: Yeah, and it lets out

5153
03:43:23,870 --> 03:43:27,570
a terrifying astral dreadnought bellow.

5154
03:43:27,570 --> 03:43:29,300
MATT: Which you've never heard.
TRAVIS: I've never heard.

5155
03:43:29,300 --> 03:43:30,770
MATT: So, what's it sound like?

5156
03:43:30,770 --> 03:43:33,555
TRAVIS: (inhales sharply)
Just a cacophony of shit.

5157
03:43:33,555 --> 03:43:35,215
(laughter)

5158
03:43:35,215 --> 03:43:38,591
Just diarrhea-inducing sounds.

5159
03:43:38,591 --> 03:43:40,324
LIAM: ♪ MMMBop ♪

5160
03:43:40,324 --> 03:43:42,507
ALL: (singing "MMMBop")
TRAVIS: (screeching)

5161
03:43:42,507 --> 03:43:45,005
MATT: That induces diarrhea.
(laughter)

5162
03:43:45,005 --> 03:43:47,570
TRAVIS: Yeah, just a thousand t-rexes

5163
03:43:47,570 --> 03:43:49,210
pitched down a couple decibels.

5164
03:43:49,210 --> 03:43:50,680
MATT: You got it, okay.
LAURA: Ooh, that's nice.

5165
03:43:50,680 --> 03:43:52,750
MATT: All of you guys see this too, by the way.

5166
03:43:53,760 --> 03:43:56,910
Suddenly, this smaller than usual astral dreadnought

5167
03:43:56,910 --> 03:43:59,920
just emerges out of the shadows on the side

5168
03:43:59,920 --> 03:44:01,460
and begins roaring.

5169
03:44:03,570 --> 03:44:05,420
So, keep that in mind for whatever role playing purposes

5170
03:44:05,420 --> 03:44:06,324
there might be.

5171
03:44:06,324 --> 03:44:08,120
LAURA: But said he was going to do it.

5172
03:44:08,120 --> 03:44:09,910
So it shouldn't be completely...

5173
03:44:09,910 --> 03:44:12,380
MARISHA: We did have the talk.
TRAVIS: It's still pretty intense.

5174
03:44:12,380 --> 03:44:14,522
MATT: It's still intense. Just be aware.

5175
03:44:14,522 --> 03:44:16,563
That's still a big thing.
LIAM: (pigeon coos)

5176
03:44:16,563 --> 03:44:19,088
MATT: Okay, that finishes Fjord's go.
Top of the round. Beauregard, you're up.

5177
03:44:19,088 --> 03:44:20,040
MARISHA: (startling)

5178
03:44:20,040 --> 03:44:21,140
MATT: Caleb, you're on deck.
LIAM: Yeah.

5179
03:44:21,140 --> 03:44:22,970
MARISHA: Shit, ugh. Okay.

5180
03:44:22,970 --> 03:44:25,470
I'm 30 feet away from it?

5181
03:44:25,470 --> 03:44:27,820
MATT: You are right now, yeah, 30 feet.

5182
03:44:27,820 --> 03:44:29,461
MARISHA: Not no mores.

5183
03:44:29,461 --> 03:44:31,430
MATT: (laughs)
SAM: Doggy paddle!

5184
03:44:31,430 --> 03:44:33,450
MARISHA: Doggy paddle.
MATT: Move forward.

5185
03:44:33,450 --> 03:44:38,105
MARISHA: I'm going to do a swan dive, going to go down,

5186
03:44:39,377 --> 03:44:41,530
going to punch him in the face.
(laughter)

5187
03:44:41,530 --> 03:44:42,530
MATT: Okay.

5188
03:44:42,530 --> 03:44:45,027
LIAM: I cast Punch Him in the Face.

5189
03:44:45,027 --> 03:44:47,425
MARISHA: (laughs)
TALIESIN: (blows raspberry)

5190
03:44:47,425 --> 03:44:49,460
MARISHA: I'm super flowery about punching.

5191
03:44:49,460 --> 03:44:51,840
LAURA: What about your lightning gloves?

5192
03:44:52,740 --> 03:44:54,340
MARISHA: It takes an action. Right?

5193
03:44:54,340 --> 03:44:56,490
Does it take an action?

5194
03:44:56,490 --> 03:44:58,140
LAURA: I thought it was a free action.

5195
03:44:59,460 --> 03:45:02,638
MARISHA: (mumbling, reading)

5196
03:45:02,638 --> 03:45:05,720
LIAM: (drumming fingers)

5197
03:45:05,720 --> 03:45:08,690
MARISHA: Yeah, I guess it doesn't take an action, does it?

5198
03:45:08,690 --> 03:45:10,330
So I can just do it.

5199
03:45:10,330 --> 03:45:11,850
LAURA: It's not taken an action before.

5200
03:45:11,850 --> 03:45:14,080
MARISHA: It doesn't specify that it takes an action.

5201
03:45:14,080 --> 03:45:15,713
MATT: Then it's a fault on my end.

5202
03:45:21,165 --> 03:45:22,280
If it hasn't previously, we'll let it go

5203
03:45:22,280 --> 03:45:23,360
for the purposes of this battle,

5204
03:45:23,360 --> 03:45:25,851
but I should've said that.
MARISHA: (imitating lightning)

5205
03:45:25,851 --> 03:45:27,840
MATT: Okay. Fists go.
MARISHA: Thanks for the reminder.

5206
03:45:27,840 --> 03:45:29,527
Would've been a waste of a turn.

5207
03:45:29,527 --> 03:45:32,000
MATT: I'll probably make it a bonus action going forward.

5208
03:45:32,000 --> 03:45:34,510
MARISHA: Okay. Oh, wait, I rolled!

5209
03:45:34,510 --> 03:45:35,420
Oh, no, I rolled,

5210
03:45:35,420 --> 03:45:37,570
and I just picked up the dice that I rolled!

5211
03:45:37,570 --> 03:45:40,562
I'm rolling again.
TALIESIN: And you get a d4.

5212
03:45:40,562 --> 03:45:42,610
MARISHA: And I have a d4!

5213
03:45:42,610 --> 03:45:45,289
Oh, the other rolls I did were way better.

5214
03:45:45,289 --> 03:45:47,270
(laughter)
MATT: You have advantage,

5215
03:45:47,270 --> 03:45:50,212
by the way, because he is prone.

5216
03:45:50,212 --> 03:45:52,504
MARISHA: Shh! Okay.
MATT: He hasn't had his turn yet.

5217
03:45:54,200 --> 03:45:55,120
MARISHA: Well, then,

5218
03:45:55,120 --> 03:45:57,530
I will take that seven with that plus four,

5219
03:45:57,530 --> 03:46:00,330
thanks Caduceus, to make it 21 total.

5220
03:46:00,330 --> 03:46:02,840
TRAVIS: He's fucking prone.
LAURA: He's what?

5221
03:46:02,840 --> 03:46:05,315
TRAVIS: Forgot he's prone.
MARISHA: 21, hits.

5222
03:46:06,699 --> 03:46:08,073
Yeah?
MATT: Mm-hmm.

5223
03:46:10,219 --> 03:46:11,435
SAM and ASHLEY: What does that mean?

5224
03:46:11,435 --> 03:46:13,530
LAURA: Melee attacks get advantage.
TRAVIS: Advantage on melee.

5225
03:46:14,772 --> 03:46:16,347
Double the chances for a nat.

5226
03:46:17,320 --> 03:46:19,080
ASHLEY: It's fine, I got this over here.

5227
03:46:19,080 --> 03:46:20,728
I'm just hacking away at him over here.

5228
03:46:20,728 --> 03:46:23,470
(laughter)
MARISHA: 10 damage.

5229
03:46:23,470 --> 03:46:25,410
TALIESIN: Just charging up over time.
MARISHA: Stunning Strike.

5230
03:46:25,410 --> 03:46:27,601
ASHLEY: Just waiting for my moment!

5231
03:46:27,601 --> 03:46:28,984
MATT: That is a 22.

5232
03:46:30,465 --> 03:46:31,820
MARISHA: He definitely saves from that.

5233
03:46:31,820 --> 03:46:34,402
MATT: Second attack?
MARISHA: Second attack.

5234
03:46:34,402 --> 03:46:36,402
With the d4.

5235
03:46:38,177 --> 03:46:39,110
23?

5236
03:46:39,110 --> 03:46:40,597
MATT: 23 hits.

5237
03:46:41,530 --> 03:46:45,040
MARISHA: Uh-huh, 11 damage.
MATT: 11 points of damage.

5238
03:46:45,040 --> 03:46:47,515
MARISHA: Stunning Strike.
MATT: Stunning Strike again.

5239
03:46:47,515 --> 03:46:50,023
MARISHA: Burning through all my ki points.
MATT: So, that is going to be...

5240
03:46:51,890 --> 03:46:53,448
16?

5241
03:46:53,448 --> 03:46:54,773
MARISHA: My save is 16.

5242
03:46:54,773 --> 03:46:55,956
MATT: Saves.

5243
03:46:58,664 --> 03:46:59,847
MARISHA: Pop pop?

5244
03:46:59,847 --> 03:47:01,930
MATT: All right. Another Flurry of Blows? Go for it.

5245
03:47:01,930 --> 03:47:04,505
MARISHA: Yikes. God, I'm getting really low.

5246
03:47:05,655 --> 03:47:07,321
SAM: Low on punches?

5247
03:47:07,321 --> 03:47:08,300
MARISHA: Kis.
SAM: Oh.

5248
03:47:08,300 --> 03:47:09,133
MARISHA: Points.

5249
03:47:09,133 --> 03:47:11,610
SAM: Do you only have a certain
number of punches every day?

5250
03:47:11,610 --> 03:47:13,571
MARISHA: I do, I have to ration out my punches.

5251
03:47:13,571 --> 03:47:15,340
(laughter)

5252
03:47:15,340 --> 03:47:20,048
MARISHA: Those were both 16s, so 26 total.

5253
03:47:20,048 --> 03:47:21,400
Plus the d4, so...

5254
03:47:21,400 --> 03:47:23,070
MATT: You rolling with advantage on each of those too?

5255
03:47:23,070 --> 03:47:24,670
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
MATT: Yep. Those all hit.

5256
03:47:24,670 --> 03:47:27,950
MARISHA: 26 is technically 30 total.
MATT: You got it.

5257
03:47:27,950 --> 03:47:29,430
TRAVIS: Nice.

5258
03:47:29,430 --> 03:47:31,148
SAM: It's looking pretty rough, right?

5259
03:47:31,148 --> 03:47:33,072
(laughter)
ASHLEY: How de doody do this?

5260
03:47:33,072 --> 03:47:35,822
(laughter)

5261
03:47:37,000 --> 03:47:40,480
MARISHA: 14 damage, and for the second one...

5262
03:47:40,480 --> 03:47:42,910
Sorry, it's a lot of dice.

5263
03:47:42,910 --> 03:47:47,910
TALIESIN: Kill him.
MARISHA: 23. 25 total to hit.

5264
03:47:48,212 --> 03:47:51,420
It's another eight for another 14 points of damage.

5265
03:47:51,420 --> 03:47:53,500
MATT: Great, all right.

5266
03:47:53,500 --> 03:47:56,470
As those blows are jamming into its side,

5267
03:47:56,470 --> 03:47:57,303
you are just angrily...

5268
03:47:57,303 --> 03:47:58,960
And you're hitting, you're doing some serious damage.

5269
03:47:58,960 --> 03:48:00,110
You can see areas

5270
03:48:00,110 --> 03:48:03,160
where the blackened rock exterior is cracking

5271
03:48:03,160 --> 03:48:06,140
and some of the molten glow is getting brighter

5272
03:48:06,140 --> 03:48:07,680
as you're actually damaging it

5273
03:48:07,680 --> 03:48:09,710
and seeing it breaking away.

5274
03:48:09,710 --> 03:48:12,660
You do suffer, ooh.
TALIESIN: Even though...?

5275
03:48:12,660 --> 03:48:13,580
Oh, yeah, you are making contact.

5276
03:48:13,580 --> 03:48:15,496
MATT: 22 points of fire damage.

5277
03:48:15,496 --> 03:48:17,020
MARISHA: I'm starting to punch lava.

5278
03:48:17,020 --> 03:48:18,570
It's starting to hurt real bad.

5279
03:48:18,570 --> 03:48:20,570
MATT: So take your 22 points of fire damage.

5280
03:48:21,930 --> 03:48:24,850
MARISHA: Beau's looking not gr--
she's looking a little charred,

5281
03:48:24,850 --> 03:48:26,640
a little blistered in a lot of places.

5282
03:48:26,640 --> 03:48:29,988
Definitely some third-degree burns in some areas.

5283
03:48:29,988 --> 03:48:32,280
MATT: Caleb, you're up.

5284
03:48:32,280 --> 03:48:35,420
LIAM: Caleb will swim around that column a bit

5285
03:48:35,420 --> 03:48:37,820
to try to get as close as possible,

5286
03:48:37,820 --> 03:48:40,680
and start weaving his hands in the water,

5287
03:48:40,680 --> 03:48:43,410
and muttering arcane words and say,

5288
03:48:43,410 --> 03:48:45,528
I have an offering for you!

5289
03:48:45,528 --> 03:48:46,890
And I will pull out my middle finger and say

5290
03:48:46,890 --> 03:48:49,770
you make a shitty god, you bedazzled cephalopod!

5291
03:48:49,770 --> 03:48:51,010
And I will cast Banishment.

5292
03:48:51,010 --> 03:48:52,280
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah!
SAM: Yes!

5293
03:48:52,280 --> 03:48:53,322
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Bravo!

5294
03:48:53,322 --> 03:48:54,690
SAM: Do this.
MARISHA: Come on.

5295
03:48:54,690 --> 03:48:56,540
ASHLEY: Let's go.
MATT: What save is that?

5296
03:48:56,540 --> 03:48:58,592
LIAM: Charisma.
MATT: Charisma.

5297
03:48:59,870 --> 03:49:02,100
MATT: 17.
LIAM: 17!

5298
03:49:02,100 --> 03:49:04,783
MATT: It's not his best save, but I rolled high on that.

5299
03:49:04,783 --> 03:49:06,660
LIAM: You rolled high. Fuck!

5300
03:49:06,660 --> 03:49:10,350
MATT: Beauregard, make a Charisma saving throw, plus a d4.

5301
03:49:10,350 --> 03:49:13,618
SAM: Oh, no!
LIAM: See you in hell, Beauregard.

5302
03:49:13,618 --> 03:49:15,730
MARISHA: (laughs) Fuck you, Caleb.

5303
03:49:15,730 --> 03:49:17,513
Fuck you!
SAM: Oh, no!

5304
03:49:18,580 --> 03:49:20,550
ASHLEY: Wait, do I have to
because I'm in the vicinity?

5305
03:49:20,550 --> 03:49:23,610
LIAM: No. He chooses.
MARISHA: He chooses?

5306
03:49:23,610 --> 03:49:25,760
ASHLEY: He chooses.
TALIESIN: Did you add your d4?

5307
03:49:25,760 --> 03:49:28,220
MARISHA: I'm about to.

5308
03:49:28,220 --> 03:49:30,544
Mmkay.
LAURA: Uh-oh.

5309
03:49:30,544 --> 03:49:33,710
MARISHA: Mm-mmm.
TRAVIS: (laughs)

5310
03:49:33,710 --> 03:49:35,700
TRAVIS: Say it!
MARISHA: 14.

5311
03:49:35,700 --> 03:49:38,893
MATT: Where were you--? Okay, so--
LIAM: To his home turf.

5312
03:49:38,893 --> 03:49:39,968
MARISHA: (yelling)

5313
03:49:39,968 --> 03:49:43,847
MATT: Beauregard vanishes from the battlefield

5314
03:49:43,847 --> 03:49:46,410
in a flash of arcane power.

5315
03:49:46,410 --> 03:49:49,280
Beauregard, as you're right there, fists burning,

5316
03:49:49,280 --> 03:49:50,820
you get this weird sensation,

5317
03:49:50,820 --> 03:49:53,320
like this weird sparkling around your torso,

5318
03:49:53,320 --> 03:49:55,310
and then suddenly darkness,

5319
03:49:56,200 --> 03:49:58,710
and you are adrift on this endless sea

5320
03:49:58,710 --> 03:50:00,740
of sparkling gossamer.
MARISHA: (incredulous laughing)

5321
03:50:00,740 --> 03:50:04,960
MATT: Stars and silver. All your friends are gone.

5322
03:50:04,960 --> 03:50:06,877
The water's gone.
TRAVIS: Oh, shit!

5323
03:50:06,877 --> 03:50:09,970
MATT: You are just floating.
SAM: Can she breathe?

5324
03:50:09,970 --> 03:50:11,844
MATT: Yeah, you can breathe.
SAM: Oh, okay.

5325
03:50:11,844 --> 03:50:13,544
LIAM: Sure, it's--
TRAVIS: Well, that's convenient.

5326
03:50:13,544 --> 03:50:15,940
MATT: And as you go to inhale-- (coughs)

5327
03:50:15,940 --> 03:50:19,130
you cough all the water out of your lungs,

5328
03:50:19,130 --> 03:50:21,030
and you are alone.
(laughter)

5329
03:50:21,030 --> 03:50:23,450
It is cold and you are alone.

5330
03:50:23,450 --> 03:50:24,870
TRAVIS: Oh, boy.
LAURA: Is it dark?

5331
03:50:24,870 --> 03:50:28,530
MATT: It's dark beyond bits of weird silver scapes

5332
03:50:28,530 --> 03:50:31,530
of cloud and sparkles from all around.

5333
03:50:31,530 --> 03:50:32,970
You see distant little clusters

5334
03:50:32,970 --> 03:50:35,470
of looks like floating rocks, slowly rotating.

5335
03:50:35,470 --> 03:50:36,680
TRAVIS: Cool, cool, cool.

5336
03:50:36,680 --> 03:50:37,960
MATT: All right
MARISHA: Am I dead?

5337
03:50:39,130 --> 03:50:40,010
MATT: Maybe.

5338
03:50:40,010 --> 03:50:42,697
LIAM: Question for the DM.
MATT: Yes.

5339
03:50:42,697 --> 03:50:44,450
LIAM: I remember-- I'm not using luck.

5340
03:50:44,450 --> 03:50:46,340
I have Fortune's Favor.

5341
03:50:46,340 --> 03:50:50,320
Luck used to be, you could make a target re-roll as well.

5342
03:50:50,320 --> 03:50:51,540
Does that apply here?
MATT: No.

5343
03:50:51,540 --> 03:50:52,940
Fortune's Favor is about your fortune.

5344
03:50:52,940 --> 03:50:54,891
Not somebody else's.
LIAM: Got it.

5345
03:50:54,891 --> 03:50:56,986
TALIESIN: Fuck.
LIAM: All right, done. Byeee!

5346
03:50:56,986 --> 03:50:58,260
MARISHA: (laughs)

5347
03:50:58,260 --> 03:51:00,720
TRAVIS: Wild.
TALIESIN: It could get worse.

5348
03:51:00,720 --> 03:51:03,120
MATT: Lair actions now.
SAM: Lair actions.

5349
03:51:03,120 --> 03:51:05,320
MATT: The creature, now getting back up into its space.

5350
03:51:05,320 --> 03:51:06,475
LIAM: Don't worry, Beau, you're safe.

5351
03:51:06,475 --> 03:51:10,050
MATT: Freaked out by what's over in that area.

5352
03:51:10,050 --> 03:51:12,260
It's going to go ahead and--
TRAVIS: You mean the giant portal

5353
03:51:12,260 --> 03:51:14,500
or the giant mini dreadnought?

5354
03:51:14,500 --> 03:51:15,350
MATT: Both.
LAURA: (laughs)

5355
03:51:15,350 --> 03:51:17,550
MATT: But this is the lair action.

5356
03:51:17,550 --> 03:51:20,250
In this space, it is going to...

5357
03:51:20,250 --> 03:51:23,080
It wastes its lair action on your illusion.

5358
03:51:23,080 --> 03:51:23,913
SAM: Yes!

5359
03:51:23,913 --> 03:51:25,200
MATT: And the direction of your illusion and your illusion.

5360
03:51:25,200 --> 03:51:27,494
SAM: Yes!
MATT: So nobody is hypnotized--

5361
03:51:27,494 --> 03:51:29,656
TRAVIS: Hey!
LAURA: Hey!

5362
03:51:29,656 --> 03:51:31,587
TRAVIS: That's something! Oh, thank god.

5363
03:51:33,350 --> 03:51:35,130
ASHLEY: Wait, I was in that, but I'm already hypnotized.

5364
03:51:35,130 --> 03:51:37,010
MATT: You're already hypnotized.
ASHLEY: I can't be doubly hypnotized.

5365
03:51:37,010 --> 03:51:40,010
SAM: Does it discern anything
about the illusions or anything?

5366
03:51:40,010 --> 03:51:41,650
MATT: It hasn't taken its turn yet.
That was its lair action.

5367
03:51:41,650 --> 03:51:43,980
SAM: Got it.
TRAVIS: Think it has to touch it.

5368
03:51:43,980 --> 03:51:45,880
MATT: Now it is Vilya's turn.

5369
03:51:45,880 --> 03:51:48,310
Vilya's going to go ahead and swim,

5370
03:51:48,310 --> 03:51:51,637
over as this orca, over here to get a visual.

5371
03:51:51,637 --> 03:51:54,113
LAURA: Ooh, she almost knocked me over!
TRAVIS: I know.

5372
03:51:54,113 --> 03:51:55,580
MATT: And is going to-- (impact)

5373
03:51:55,580 --> 03:51:57,700
bring the bolt down onto Vokodo.

5374
03:51:57,700 --> 03:52:00,600
LAURA: I like to picture the killer whale's little fin.

5375
03:52:02,383 --> 03:52:03,610
SAM: (laughs)

5376
03:52:03,610 --> 03:52:05,975
MATT: However, it does succeed on the save.

5377
03:52:07,733 --> 03:52:10,924
LIAM: (imitating killer whale)

5378
03:52:13,270 --> 03:52:15,591
And completely misses it--

5379
03:52:15,591 --> 03:52:16,824
LAURA: (gasps)

5380
03:52:16,824 --> 03:52:19,380
MATT: -- as the bolt fires down instead,

5381
03:52:19,380 --> 03:52:21,700
and strikes Fjord.

5382
03:52:21,700 --> 03:52:23,490
I need you to make a Dexterity saving throw.

5383
03:52:23,490 --> 03:52:26,460
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.
LAURA: Oh, no, she rolled a one?

5384
03:52:26,460 --> 03:52:28,140
How did that miss it?

5385
03:52:28,140 --> 03:52:30,921
MATT: He made his saving throw.
SAM: Thanks, Keyleth's mom.

5386
03:52:30,921 --> 03:52:33,388
(laughter)

5387
03:52:33,388 --> 03:52:35,255
MARISHA: I was waiting for it, yeah!

5388
03:52:35,255 --> 03:52:39,608
(laughter)

5389
03:52:39,608 --> 03:52:42,580
MARISHA: Apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
SAM: Way to go, Keyleth's mom.

5390
03:52:42,580 --> 03:52:45,381
TRAVIS: 17.
LIAM: Oh, man. A joke five years in the making.

5391
03:52:45,381 --> 03:52:46,214
(laughter)

5392
03:52:46,214 --> 03:52:47,960
TRAVIS: That's-- d4 for Bless, right?

5393
03:52:47,960 --> 03:52:50,510
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: That's exactly her spell DC,

5394
03:52:50,510 --> 03:52:52,140
so you take half damage.

5395
03:52:52,140 --> 03:52:54,957
TRAVIS: Okay, okay. 5d10, half of that?

5396
03:52:54,957 --> 03:52:57,177
TALIESIN: Do they both take half damage, or no?

5397
03:52:57,177 --> 03:52:58,241
MATT: He does not.

5398
03:52:58,241 --> 03:53:00,470
LIAM: ♪ Keyleth's mom don't got it going on ♪

5399
03:53:00,470 --> 03:53:01,900
LAURA: He doesn't take any damage from it?

5400
03:53:01,900 --> 03:53:03,900
MATT: Not if he makes the save on something for half.

5401
03:53:03,900 --> 03:53:05,100
TALIESIN: Fuck.

5402
03:53:06,808 --> 03:53:07,971
MATT: All right.

5403
03:53:09,221 --> 03:53:10,587
MARISHA: (laughs)

5404
03:53:12,020 --> 03:53:14,729
MATT: 28 points of lightning damage, reduced to 14.

5405
03:53:14,729 --> 03:53:16,420
You take 14 points of lightning damage, Fjord.

5406
03:53:16,420 --> 03:53:17,860
TRAVIS: Wow.
MATT: And if I recall...

5407
03:53:17,860 --> 03:53:19,758
TRAVIS: That's serious.

5408
03:53:19,758 --> 03:53:22,925
(intense, dark music)

5409
03:53:24,758 --> 03:53:25,591
MATT: Let's see.

5410
03:53:25,591 --> 03:53:27,400
Each creature within five feet of that point.

5411
03:53:27,400 --> 03:53:29,720
So, I need both Veth and Jester

5412
03:53:29,720 --> 03:53:31,310
to also make Dexterity saving throws.

5413
03:53:31,310 --> 03:53:32,710
LAURA: Motherfuck.
SAM: Wait, what?

5414
03:53:34,080 --> 03:53:35,570
TRAVIS: It's electrifying!

5415
03:53:35,570 --> 03:53:39,000
SAM: I'm so far away from it.
LIAM: We can't let this NPC die.

5416
03:53:39,000 --> 03:53:40,190
LAURA: Oh, no, we're next to Fjord though.

5417
03:53:40,190 --> 03:53:41,800
MATT: You guys are both within five feet of Fjord,

5418
03:53:41,800 --> 03:53:43,530
and it struck Fjord.
TRAVIS: Oh, man.

5419
03:53:43,530 --> 03:53:46,010
LIAM: We have to get her to--
TRAVIS: Home?

5420
03:53:46,010 --> 03:53:47,293
LIAM: -- Zephrah.
LAURA: 11.

5421
03:53:47,293 --> 03:53:48,980
LIAM: We have to.
SAM: 23.

5422
03:53:48,980 --> 03:53:49,813
LIAM: Must.
MATT: You succeed and take

5423
03:53:49,813 --> 03:53:51,732
no damage because of your Evasion ability.

5424
03:53:51,732 --> 03:53:53,482
SAM: That's right.
MATT: You take the full brunt of it.

5425
03:53:53,482 --> 03:53:54,350
Wait, how much did you take again?

5426
03:53:54,350 --> 03:53:55,330
You took...
TRAVIS: I took 14.

5427
03:53:55,330 --> 03:53:57,350
MATT: 14. 28 points lightning damage to you, Jester.

5428
03:53:57,350 --> 03:54:00,325
SAM: (groans) Jester!
TRAVIS: Wow. It did more to her than me.

5429
03:54:00,325 --> 03:54:01,166
SAM: Wow!

5430
03:54:01,166 --> 03:54:03,297
MATT: Vilya, at this point, the orca goes--

5431
03:54:04,617 --> 03:54:06,007
(orca wailing)

5432
03:54:06,007 --> 03:54:08,970
and gives this baleful sorry sound

5433
03:54:08,970 --> 03:54:11,630
throughout the water that all of you hear.

5434
03:54:11,630 --> 03:54:13,450
SAM: Sorry.
LAURA: 28 points?

5435
03:54:13,450 --> 03:54:15,303
MATT: 28 points.
LAURA: Okay.

5436
03:54:17,420 --> 03:54:20,750
MATT: Okay, that finishes her go. It is now Vokodo's turn.

5437
03:54:20,750 --> 03:54:25,500
Vokodo is extremely scared of this thing.

5438
03:54:25,500 --> 03:54:27,568
It's going to use its action to try--

5439
03:54:28,453 --> 03:54:30,690
It's going to try and move away from the illusion.

5440
03:54:30,690 --> 03:54:32,200
It's going to use its action to try and discern

5441
03:54:32,200 --> 03:54:33,830
whatever it is you're opening there.

5442
03:54:33,830 --> 03:54:35,351
SAM: It's another Intelligence check.

5443
03:54:35,351 --> 03:54:38,430
MATT: Weirdly, it seems more scared of what you're doing

5444
03:54:38,430 --> 03:54:40,090
than what you created.

5445
03:54:40,090 --> 03:54:42,899
So what is it?
SAM: You did good. Intelligence 15.

5446
03:54:42,899 --> 03:54:45,480
MATT: Intelligence 15.

5447
03:54:45,480 --> 03:54:47,680
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that succeeds.

5448
03:54:49,553 --> 03:54:51,930
SAM: It's a battle of minds.
MATT: It is.

5449
03:54:51,930 --> 03:54:53,150
As it looks towards it,

5450
03:54:53,150 --> 03:54:55,450
you can see it's about to flee from that,

5451
03:54:55,450 --> 03:54:59,600
and then the eyes look over in your direction,

5452
03:54:59,600 --> 03:55:00,433
as you've exposed yourself,

5453
03:55:00,433 --> 03:55:02,660
still after casting the spell behind the side,

5454
03:55:02,660 --> 03:55:04,840
after you're fried by the lightning.

5455
03:55:04,840 --> 03:55:07,280
Or actually, no, you managed to dodge it
and put yourself out in the open,

5456
03:55:07,280 --> 03:55:09,110
and it sees you, and you're like, "Ah, shit!"

5457
03:55:09,110 --> 03:55:10,660
However, its eyes still looking at the illusion

5458
03:55:10,660 --> 03:55:12,500
that you've created, too. It's like...

5459
03:55:12,500 --> 03:55:15,440
And it's going to attempt to move back with its movement.

5460
03:55:15,440 --> 03:55:20,440
SAM: So now that it's discerned, my thing's dead, yeah?

5461
03:55:20,450 --> 03:55:23,200
MATT: Actually, make a concentration check for me.

5462
03:55:23,200 --> 03:55:24,600
This might change things,

5463
03:55:24,600 --> 03:55:26,700
because you're holding the spell.

5464
03:55:26,700 --> 03:55:29,730
SAM: I was, but I think once he discerns that it's false...

5465
03:55:29,730 --> 03:55:32,010
MATT: Right, but if you fail your concentration check,

5466
03:55:32,010 --> 03:55:33,930
the spell would have faded
before it came to his turn, so.

5467
03:55:33,930 --> 03:55:34,960
SAM: Oh, got it.

5468
03:55:34,960 --> 03:55:36,920
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw.

5469
03:55:36,920 --> 03:55:38,250
SAM: But I didn't get hit.
MATT: That's true.

5470
03:55:38,250 --> 03:55:40,260
You took no damage. So, no.
This works out fine.

5471
03:55:40,260 --> 03:55:41,093
You're right, you're right.

5472
03:55:41,093 --> 03:55:42,741
So, pulling back, he's going to go ahead

5473
03:55:42,741 --> 03:55:47,507
and swim backward 50 feet.

5474
03:55:47,507 --> 03:55:48,340
TRAVIS: Five zero?

5475
03:55:48,340 --> 03:55:50,730
MATT: Yes. That'll put him back about there.

5476
03:55:50,730 --> 03:55:52,040
LIAM: Jeez.

5477
03:55:52,040 --> 03:55:56,078
SAM: Take your attack of opportunity, Yasha.

5478
03:55:57,261 --> 03:55:58,566
LIAM: Nope.
MATT: (sighs)

5479
03:55:58,566 --> 03:56:00,550
(laughter)

5480
03:56:00,550 --> 03:56:02,258
MATT: That wasted his action.

5481
03:56:02,258 --> 03:56:03,349
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.
SAM: That's great.

5482
03:56:03,349 --> 03:56:05,480
MATT: So now as you watch, he's like--

5483
03:56:05,480 --> 03:56:08,750
octopus swimming backward as small coins and baubles

5484
03:56:08,750 --> 03:56:10,120
are falling off of its body,

5485
03:56:10,120 --> 03:56:14,100
its eyes wildly staring at the large astral dreadnought

5486
03:56:14,100 --> 03:56:15,600
that's sitting there in front.

5487
03:56:16,500 --> 03:56:19,330
So, your guys' teamwork fucked up his round.

5488
03:56:19,330 --> 03:56:22,080
SAM: Yeah.
MATT: That's going to finish his go.

5489
03:56:22,080 --> 03:56:25,440
Oh, and everybody at the top of his turn, sorry--

5490
03:56:25,440 --> 03:56:26,648
SAM: Takes...

5491
03:56:27,590 --> 03:56:30,340
MATT: Takes four points of fire damage.

5492
03:56:30,340 --> 03:56:33,100
LAURA: Except for you, Beau!
MARISHA: I'm so lucky.

5493
03:56:33,100 --> 03:56:34,490
LIAM: Is that from the water heating up?

5494
03:56:34,490 --> 03:56:36,315
MATT: Yes.
LIAM: Yeah. Four points.

5495
03:56:36,315 --> 03:56:38,265
SAM: That's nothing!
LIAM: I can't wait for Beau's turn.

5496
03:56:38,265 --> 03:56:41,270
TRAVIS: No boiling water in the middle of fucking nowhere!

5497
03:56:41,270 --> 03:56:44,885
MATT: Yasha, it's your turn.
MARISHA: Water can't boil in space!

5498
03:56:44,885 --> 03:56:47,990
MATT: So you move--
TALIESIN: Advantage with the d4.

5499
03:56:48,970 --> 03:56:52,215
MATT: You move 20 more feet, because you can.

5500
03:56:53,285 --> 03:56:56,380
That puts you right about there.

5501
03:56:56,380 --> 03:56:58,030
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: Staring towards him.

5502
03:56:58,030 --> 03:56:59,430
And you dash to get up there as well,

5503
03:56:59,430 --> 03:57:01,380
so you are right up in his face.

5504
03:57:01,380 --> 03:57:03,220
ASHLEY: Can you use the d4 for--
TALIESIN: Yeah, every time.

5505
03:57:03,220 --> 03:57:04,960
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay.

5506
03:57:07,610 --> 03:57:11,585
(sighs) 19.
MATT: 19 succeeds.

5507
03:57:11,585 --> 03:57:12,649
ASHLEY: Yeah!

5508
03:57:12,649 --> 03:57:13,482
So at the end of your turn,

5509
03:57:13,482 --> 03:57:15,130
as you rush up again, still staring at it,

5510
03:57:15,130 --> 03:57:18,110
suddenly as you see its eyes distracted by this creature,

5511
03:57:18,110 --> 03:57:20,675
the astral dreadnought screams,
and you shake your head,

5512
03:57:20,675 --> 03:57:23,725
the roar of the illusion piercing
through your head for a second.

5513
03:57:23,725 --> 03:57:26,457
You look and see it
and for a moment, your heart drops.

5514
03:57:26,457 --> 03:57:28,061
(gasps)

5515
03:57:28,061 --> 03:57:30,200
Fjord had mentioned this earlier,

5516
03:57:30,200 --> 03:57:32,860
and you feel, for a moment, foolish for the fact

5517
03:57:32,860 --> 03:57:36,350
that you've been caught in this hypnosis by this creature.

5518
03:57:36,350 --> 03:57:38,200
But that foolishness fades

5519
03:57:38,200 --> 03:57:41,980
and goes immediate into this deep, deep anger.

5520
03:57:41,980 --> 03:57:43,940
MARISHA: Yes.
MATT: So that ends your turn.

5521
03:57:43,940 --> 03:57:46,100
TRAVIS: Let's go. Let's go!
MATT: Jester, you're up,

5522
03:57:46,100 --> 03:57:48,250
and Veth, you're on deck.
TRAVIS: Let's go!

5523
03:57:48,250 --> 03:57:52,040
ASHLEY: Right in front of his mouth. I'm like-- oh.

5524
03:57:52,040 --> 03:57:54,988
Wait, so I can't move from there, right?

5525
03:57:54,988 --> 03:57:56,070
MATT: Correct, that's the end of your turn.

5526
03:57:56,070 --> 03:57:59,730
ASHLEY: Got it, got it, got it. Okay.

5527
03:57:59,730 --> 03:58:01,390
TRAVIS: Have some dental work.
ASHLEY: That's okay, that's okay.

5528
03:58:01,390 --> 03:58:02,223
Thank you for that.

5529
03:58:02,223 --> 03:58:04,820
LAURA: I'm going to take a cue from Caleb--

5530
03:58:04,820 --> 03:58:05,653
(claps)

5531
03:58:05,653 --> 03:58:09,830
and I'm going to have my duplicate swim up.

5532
03:58:09,830 --> 03:58:11,550
MATT: All righty.

5533
03:58:11,550 --> 03:58:16,450
LAURA: And pull out a little duplicate sequinsed glove,

5534
03:58:16,450 --> 03:58:18,590
and wave it around and be like,

5535
03:58:18,590 --> 03:58:20,470
here's your other offering!
(blows raspberry)

5536
03:58:20,470 --> 03:58:23,310
And cast Banishment.
MATT: Through him?

5537
03:58:24,220 --> 03:58:26,385
LAURA: Through my duplicate, yeah.
MATT: Okay.

5538
03:58:26,385 --> 03:58:28,885
And that is Charisma, right?
LIAM: Charisma, yeah.

5539
03:58:28,885 --> 03:58:30,320
Come on, Jester.

5540
03:58:30,320 --> 03:58:31,153
MATT: That's a fail.

5541
03:58:31,153 --> 03:58:33,611
He's going to use his last
Legendary Resistance to resist it.

5542
03:58:33,611 --> 03:58:34,852
MARISHA: Last one.
TRAVIS: His last.

5543
03:58:34,852 --> 03:58:37,110
LIAM: All right.

5544
03:58:37,110 --> 03:58:38,680
MARISHA: It would've been funny if it was me and him

5545
03:58:38,680 --> 03:58:42,470
hanging out in the Abyss, though. (laughs)

5546
03:58:42,470 --> 03:58:44,320
LAURA: Oops!
ASHLEY: He just bamfs right next to you.

5547
03:58:44,320 --> 03:58:46,220
MATT: However, Yasha, I need you
to make a Charisma saving throw.

5548
03:58:46,220 --> 03:58:48,653
TRAVIS: Oh.
LAURA: Is it Yasha? He would choose Yasha?

5549
03:58:48,653 --> 03:58:50,410
He wouldn't choose Veth or something, because...

5550
03:58:50,410 --> 03:58:51,790
MATT: Actually, you know what, you're right.

5551
03:58:51,790 --> 03:58:55,292
Yasha, hang there.

5552
03:58:56,460 --> 03:58:58,185
Instead...
LAURA: I don't know why I switched to Veth.

5553
03:58:58,185 --> 03:59:00,570
I thought your Charisma was high
but then I realized yours is also low.

5554
03:59:00,570 --> 03:59:03,203
SAM: Don't worry, I'll be fine.
MATT: Yasha hasn't been a huge threat at this point.

5555
03:59:03,203 --> 03:59:05,495
He's not aware of that.
Instead he's going to go ahead

5556
03:59:05,495 --> 03:59:08,297
and Caduceus, make a Charisma saving throw.

5557
03:59:08,297 --> 03:59:10,154
TALIESIN: I haven't done shit. All right.

5558
03:59:11,029 --> 03:59:12,044
LIAM: Where is Cad on the board?

5559
03:59:12,044 --> 03:59:13,603
I don't see him on there.

5560
03:59:15,610 --> 03:59:17,820
TALIESIN: Ooh. 16?

5561
03:59:18,900 --> 03:59:20,857
MATT: What's your spell DC?
LAURA: Uh-oh. (laughs)

5562
03:59:20,857 --> 03:59:23,231
MATT: (laughs)
TALIESIN: Oh, for Pete--

5563
03:59:23,231 --> 03:59:28,223
(laughter)

5564
03:59:29,720 --> 03:59:32,150
TALIESIN: Do I see you?
MARISHA: Does he see me?

5565
03:59:32,150 --> 03:59:33,900
MATT: Where were you sending?
LAURA: Same place.

5566
03:59:33,900 --> 03:59:35,525
MATT: Same place?
LIAM: Wow.

5567
03:59:36,500 --> 03:59:40,124
MATT: Roll a d20 for me, Caduceus.
MARISHA: Come on, come on!

5568
03:59:40,124 --> 03:59:41,920
MATT: If it's an 11--
TALIESIN: Nine.

5569
03:59:41,920 --> 03:59:44,780
MATT: Nine. So, no it is not the same place.

5570
03:59:44,780 --> 03:59:46,630
10 or higher, you were going to be in the same place.

5571
03:59:46,630 --> 03:59:49,618
So, you suddenly go into a brief moment of darkness,

5572
03:59:49,618 --> 03:59:51,240
find yourself now floating

5573
03:59:51,240 --> 03:59:54,860
in the same gossamer space, seeing the distant sparkles

5574
03:59:54,860 --> 03:59:56,920
and weird, distant winds

5575
03:59:56,920 --> 04:00:01,260
that look almost like deep clouds in space

5576
04:00:01,260 --> 04:00:03,740
with large shadowed land masses in the distance,

5577
04:00:03,740 --> 04:00:04,940
and you hear a distant...

5578
04:00:04,940 --> 04:00:06,480
Sounds like a whale.

5579
04:00:06,480 --> 04:00:08,408
A very deep, resonant whale

5580
04:00:08,408 --> 04:00:11,890
(whale bellowing)
behind you.

5581
04:00:11,890 --> 04:00:14,450
And you turn and look, and there is a shadow.

5582
04:00:14,450 --> 04:00:16,200
You're not sure how far away,

5583
04:00:16,200 --> 04:00:18,058
but it is getting slowly bigger.

5584
04:00:18,058 --> 04:00:19,885
SAM: Oh, Jesus.
ASHLEY: Uh-oh.

5585
04:00:19,885 --> 04:00:21,675
MATT: And bigger.
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

5586
04:00:22,550 --> 04:00:24,467
MARISHA: And I don't see him anywhere?
We are not in the same--

5587
04:00:24,467 --> 04:00:26,866
MATT: No.
MARISHA: Fuck! That would've been fun at least.

5588
04:00:26,866 --> 04:00:30,310
TRAVIS: Just two bodies going-- (screaming)

5589
04:00:30,310 --> 04:00:32,600
MARISHA: We'll die together!
MATT: (laughs)

5590
04:00:32,600 --> 04:00:35,505
MATT: You guys are 700 light years away.

5591
04:00:35,505 --> 04:00:37,320
MARISHA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

5592
04:00:37,320 --> 04:00:40,620
MATT: All right. Jester, that finish your turn?

5593
04:00:40,620 --> 04:00:41,750
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

5594
04:00:41,750 --> 04:00:43,660
So you're not moving at all? You're staying put?

5595
04:00:43,660 --> 04:00:45,776
LAURA: I'm going to swim forward.

5596
04:00:47,560 --> 04:00:48,960
MATT: To there?

5597
04:00:48,960 --> 04:00:50,866
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to get as close as I can,

5598
04:00:50,866 --> 04:00:53,660
because everything's moving.
MATT: That'll put you there.

5599
04:00:53,660 --> 04:00:55,080
All righty, finishing Jester's go.

5600
04:00:55,080 --> 04:00:57,040
Veth, you're up. Caduceus, you're on deck.

5601
04:00:58,600 --> 04:00:59,860
Wherever you are.

5602
04:00:59,860 --> 04:01:03,009
SAM: I guess I'll move 15 feet.

5603
04:01:03,009 --> 04:01:03,842
MATT: Okay.

5604
04:01:05,080 --> 04:01:08,596
That'll put you about there.

5605
04:01:09,755 --> 04:01:11,655
SAM: Dash 15 feet. (laughing)

5606
04:01:12,900 --> 04:01:15,810
I can't do anything from farther than 30, right?

5607
04:01:17,310 --> 04:01:18,540
MATT: That's as far as you can get.

5608
04:01:18,540 --> 04:01:22,043
SAM: And I will also use my action
to go another 15 feet.

5609
04:01:22,043 --> 04:01:25,768
MATT: Okay. Put you about there.

5610
04:01:25,768 --> 04:01:28,960
SAM: Am I within range? No.
MATT: You don't know.

5611
04:01:30,030 --> 04:01:31,630
SAM: Well, that's it.
MATT: All right.

5612
04:01:31,630 --> 04:01:32,960
Finishes Veth's turn.

5613
04:01:32,960 --> 04:01:35,200
Caduceus, you are out in the middle of nowhere,

5614
04:01:35,200 --> 04:01:37,880
with this strange, looming shadow coming towards you.

5615
04:01:38,820 --> 04:01:41,290
TALIESIN: Can I move? Am I on solid ground, or...?

5616
04:01:41,290 --> 04:01:42,660
MATT: No, you're just floating in space.

5617
04:01:42,660 --> 04:01:45,341
TALIESIN: Floating in space, and
there's a weird shadow coming at me?

5618
04:01:45,341 --> 04:01:47,810
MATT: You have been in a similar
space before in the Happy Fun Ball,

5619
04:01:47,810 --> 04:01:48,880
and you do recall when you were there

5620
04:01:48,880 --> 04:01:51,500
that you just willed yourself in a direction
and you floated where you--

5621
04:01:51,500 --> 04:01:53,360
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and find some cover.

5622
04:01:53,360 --> 04:01:56,044
MATT: Okay. You look around.
(laughter)

5623
04:01:56,044 --> 04:01:59,170
There is a rocky mass.

5624
04:01:59,170 --> 04:02:00,727
Once again, not sure how big it is,

5625
04:02:00,727 --> 04:02:03,100
but it's slowly drifting, an upward angle.

5626
04:02:03,100 --> 04:02:04,530
You start gliding towards it,

5627
04:02:04,530 --> 04:02:06,200
and it gets ever so slightly bigger,

5628
04:02:06,200 --> 04:02:07,625
and with the little bit of movement you go,

5629
04:02:07,625 --> 04:02:09,215
"Ah, it's like a half-mile away."

5630
04:02:09,215 --> 04:02:11,260
(laughter)
TALIESIN: Fuck, okay.

5631
04:02:11,260 --> 04:02:12,990
LIAM: It's that forced perspective again.

5632
04:02:12,990 --> 04:02:14,493
MARISHA: Yeah, it works great, I'm telling you.

5633
04:02:14,493 --> 04:02:17,185
LIAM: Is that Ian McKellen? I can't
tell if it's six feet tall, or...

5634
04:02:17,185 --> 04:02:19,857
TRAVIS: 'Til you realize it's just a toe.

5635
04:02:19,857 --> 04:02:20,973
MARISHA: Ooh.

5636
04:02:20,973 --> 04:02:22,390
TALIESIN: There's no way I can just--

5637
04:02:22,390 --> 04:02:25,420
MARISHA: Didn't expect you here.
TALIESIN: Back to earth, is there? No.

5638
04:02:25,420 --> 04:02:28,950
MATT: You cast Banishment on yourself? Sure.
TALIESIN: Who knows where I'll show up, right?

5639
04:02:28,950 --> 04:02:30,883
MATT: Yeah.
TALIESIN: I can't pinpoint target where I'm going.

5640
04:02:30,883 --> 04:02:32,558
MATT: Correct.

5641
04:02:32,558 --> 04:02:33,933
MARISHA: He makes the hobbits look so--

5642
04:02:33,933 --> 04:02:35,000
LAURA: Sorry.
TALIESIN: Sounds like a terrible idea.

5643
04:02:35,000 --> 04:02:37,240
LIAM: If it was me, I'd stay.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

5644
04:02:37,240 --> 04:02:40,378
TRAVIS: Burned the Resistance, though.
TALIESIN: I'm just going to--

5645
04:02:40,378 --> 04:02:42,161
SAM: That's his last, I think. Maybe.

5646
04:02:42,161 --> 04:02:44,860
TALIESIN: I'm going to--
LIAM: He said it was.

5647
04:02:46,296 --> 04:02:48,662
TALIESIN: I'm just going to hold a, uh--

5648
04:02:49,654 --> 04:02:53,671
Sacred Flame in case anything tries to do anything to me,

5649
04:02:53,671 --> 04:02:56,480
but I'm going to try and just keep chill and quiet.

5650
04:02:56,480 --> 04:02:58,191
MATT: Okay. I'm checking one thing real fast.

5651
04:02:58,191 --> 04:03:00,080
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.
TRAVIS: I love it.

5652
04:03:01,380 --> 04:03:04,690
TALIESIN: Actually, I'm just going
to cast Resistance on myself

5653
04:03:04,690 --> 04:03:05,910
and just try and chill.

5654
04:03:05,910 --> 04:03:08,140
TRAVIS: Resistance to...?
TALIESIN: Resistance is just--

5655
04:03:08,140 --> 04:03:08,973
TRAVIS: Space whale?

5656
04:03:08,973 --> 04:03:11,680
TALIESIN: It's just a bonus to a saving throw.

5657
04:03:11,680 --> 04:03:14,630
TRAVIS: Cool, cool.
TALIESIN: If I choose to take it.

5658
04:03:14,630 --> 04:03:15,900
TRAVIS: You're like that guy that got left behind

5659
04:03:15,900 --> 04:03:17,160
by the scuba expedition.

5660
04:03:17,160 --> 04:03:18,340
You're just floating in the sea.

5661
04:03:18,340 --> 04:03:19,740
MATT: I'll say for the purposes of this,

5662
04:03:19,740 --> 04:03:20,990
you still maintain concentration,

5663
04:03:20,990 --> 04:03:22,030
though you're on a different plane,

5664
04:03:22,030 --> 04:03:24,060
because the spell is still being concentrated on.

5665
04:03:24,060 --> 04:03:25,800
I'll say there is still that thread that connects there.

5666
04:03:25,800 --> 04:03:27,380
TALIESIN: Oh, then yeah, I'm not doing anything, then.

5667
04:03:27,380 --> 04:03:30,290
MATT: Right, right.
TALIESIN: I'm going to wait here

5668
04:03:30,290 --> 04:03:31,770
and just keep my eyes open

5669
04:03:31,770 --> 04:03:34,530
and hope that that thing is not coming towards me.

5670
04:03:34,530 --> 04:03:36,300
MATT: All right. You can hold an action if you want.

5671
04:03:36,300 --> 04:03:37,910
TALIESIN: I will hold a Sacred Flame just in case.

5672
04:03:37,910 --> 04:03:38,780
MATT: Sacred Flame, you got it.

5673
04:03:38,780 --> 04:03:40,050
All right, finishing your go, Caduceus.

5674
04:03:40,050 --> 04:03:42,170
Fjord, you're up.

5675
04:03:42,170 --> 04:03:45,475
LAURA: I cast a concentration spell through my duplicate,

5676
04:03:46,350 --> 04:03:49,020
which is also concentration, so should we just say

5677
04:03:49,020 --> 04:03:52,600
that she disappears?
MATT: Wait, what do you mean?

5678
04:03:52,600 --> 04:03:56,700
LAURA: I cast Banishment, which is a concentration spell,

5679
04:03:56,700 --> 04:03:58,580
through my duplicate.
MATT: Oh, got you.

5680
04:03:58,580 --> 04:04:00,180
So she vanishes.
LAURA: So either she vanishes,

5681
04:04:00,180 --> 04:04:02,160
or the Banishment didn't take hold.

5682
04:04:02,160 --> 04:04:03,110
MATT: No, it super ends.

5683
04:04:03,110 --> 04:04:05,990
So she vanishes, and the Banishment goes off.

5684
04:04:05,990 --> 04:04:06,823
So, there you go.

5685
04:04:06,823 --> 04:04:08,240
Good call, thank you for looking out on that.

5686
04:04:08,240 --> 04:04:10,250
SAM: Also, as I was swimming by,

5687
04:04:10,250 --> 04:04:13,559
I act scared of Fjord's thing.
MATT: (laughs)

5688
04:04:13,559 --> 04:04:15,478
MATT and SAM: (screaming)

5689
04:04:15,478 --> 04:04:17,290
SAM: But I'm still swimming right by it.

5690
04:04:17,290 --> 04:04:18,430
MATT: You got it.
(laughter)

5691
04:04:18,430 --> 04:04:20,920
Okay. That finishes his go.

5692
04:04:20,920 --> 04:04:22,510
Fjord, you're up. Beau, you're on deck.

5693
04:04:22,510 --> 04:04:25,136
TRAVIS: Do we want to drive it further away?

5694
04:04:25,136 --> 04:04:25,969
LAURA: No.
LIAM: No.

5695
04:04:25,969 --> 04:04:27,635
TRAVIS: Distance is a problem?
LAURA: No, distance sucks, man.

5696
04:04:27,635 --> 04:04:29,220
TRAVIS: Okay.
LIAM: Bring it in, if you can.

5697
04:04:29,220 --> 04:04:34,213
TRAVIS: I'm going to use my action
to move astral dreadnought lite.

5698
04:04:35,760 --> 04:04:38,460
It has a range of 120 feet, so it can go...

5699
04:04:38,460 --> 04:04:40,660
Let's go bring it up this way, closer...

5700
04:04:40,660 --> 04:04:42,649
MATT: Okay. You will need to see where it's going,

5701
04:04:42,649 --> 04:04:44,130
so you probably have to--
TRAVIS: Okay.

5702
04:04:44,130 --> 04:04:45,820
I'll actually use all 35 of my feet

5703
04:04:45,820 --> 04:04:49,920
to come around this side.
LIAM: You have 35 feet?

5704
04:04:49,920 --> 04:04:50,860
SAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: 30. 30 feet.

5705
04:04:50,860 --> 04:04:54,100
SAM: He's a millipede.
LIAM: (babbling)

5706
04:04:54,100 --> 04:04:56,440
MATT: So, okay, with that, that'll put you up and over.

5707
04:04:56,440 --> 04:04:58,120
It's 10 feet, 15, 20 feet.

5708
04:04:58,120 --> 04:04:59,160
So that would get you right there.

5709
04:04:59,160 --> 04:05:00,318
TRAVIS: Okay, great.

5710
04:05:01,297 --> 04:05:03,092
TALIESIN: Won't it be funny if--

5711
04:05:03,092 --> 04:05:07,886
TRAVIS: Wonder if I should go wide,
just around this side of it.

5712
04:05:07,886 --> 04:05:09,360
MATT: On that side? Okay.

5713
04:05:09,360 --> 04:05:11,680
So that'll put you about--
TRAVIS: So I'm not--

5714
04:05:11,680 --> 04:05:13,520
MATT: -- there, we'll say.
TRAVIS: Cool, that's great.

5715
04:05:13,520 --> 04:05:16,540
And then I'll move the bubble this way

5716
04:05:16,540 --> 04:05:18,320
back to this side.
MATT: Back to here?

5717
04:05:18,320 --> 04:05:23,160
TRAVIS: Yeah. Try and herd him back towards the doggies.

5718
04:05:23,160 --> 04:05:25,594
MATT: So, the dreadnought
(rushing water)

5719
04:05:25,594 --> 04:05:27,990
whips around alongside the wall

5720
04:05:27,990 --> 04:05:30,800
and is now almost floating a little higher,

5721
04:05:30,800 --> 04:05:32,520
exactly where it is on this direction,

5722
04:05:32,520 --> 04:05:34,210
and it's giving that same roar.

5723
04:05:34,210 --> 04:05:37,110
TRAVIS: And let's just say that he went above,

5724
04:05:37,110 --> 04:05:40,080
so he's forcing him down towards the floor.

5725
04:05:40,080 --> 04:05:41,760
There's no escape.
MATT: Right. Pushing it down?

5726
04:05:41,760 --> 04:05:44,631
Okay. As it moves, the head shifts all the eyes,

5727
04:05:44,631 --> 04:05:46,770
and you can see it's now already moving its physicality

5728
04:05:46,770 --> 04:05:49,530
to try and prepare and react to its shifting.

5729
04:05:49,530 --> 04:05:53,910
TRAVIS: Okay. That is my ... turn.

5730
04:05:53,910 --> 04:05:55,140
MATT: So it's an action to make that shift.

5731
04:05:55,140 --> 04:05:55,973
TRAVIS: Yes.
MATT: You got it.

5732
04:05:55,973 --> 04:05:57,510
Okay. Finishing Fjord's go.

5733
04:05:57,510 --> 04:05:59,690
Beau, you are floating out in space.

5734
04:05:59,690 --> 04:06:01,006
MARISHA: Yeah.

5735
04:06:04,454 --> 04:06:05,287
Do I see anything?

5736
04:06:05,287 --> 04:06:07,390
LIAM: Make the best of it.
MATT: Make a perception check.

5737
04:06:10,746 --> 04:06:13,967
MARISHA: Yeah, okay. 21.

5738
04:06:13,967 --> 04:06:14,980
MATT: 21?
MARISHA: For the Perception check.

5739
04:06:14,980 --> 04:06:16,350
MATT: Okay.

5740
04:06:16,350 --> 04:06:19,080
Glancing around, (sighs)

5741
04:06:19,080 --> 04:06:22,820
you don't see anything in your immediate visual sight,

5742
04:06:22,820 --> 04:06:24,180
and as you glance down below,

5743
04:06:24,180 --> 04:06:29,040
you can see some sort of a massive shape.

5744
04:06:29,040 --> 04:06:29,920
LAURA: Oh, god.

5745
04:06:29,920 --> 04:06:31,610
MATT: Once again, uncertain of the distance.

5746
04:06:31,610 --> 04:06:33,000
TALIESIN: Hey, you're on the other side.

5747
04:06:33,000 --> 04:06:34,660
MARISHA: Totally. You're above it, I guess.

5748
04:06:34,660 --> 04:06:36,820
TALIESIN: So far.
MARISHA: Yeah, but potentially miles.

5749
04:06:36,820 --> 04:06:39,210
Yeah.
TALIESIN: Small dimension.

5750
04:06:39,210 --> 04:06:41,260
MARISHA: So small.
MATT: So, you notice that.

5751
04:06:43,054 --> 04:06:44,778
MARISHA: I can't do anything, can I?

5752
04:06:44,778 --> 04:06:46,136
LAURA: Can you hold actions?
MATT: Whatever you want to do.

5753
04:06:46,136 --> 04:06:47,870
You can hold actions, if you want to.

5754
04:06:47,870 --> 04:06:49,178
LAURA: In case?

5755
04:06:49,178 --> 04:06:53,794
MARISHA: I will ... hold my action.

5756
04:06:53,794 --> 04:06:56,400
TRAVIS: Punch the giant floating thing.

5757
04:06:56,400 --> 04:06:59,240
MARISHA: Punch on arrival.
MATT: Okay, you got it.

5758
04:06:59,240 --> 04:07:00,420
SAM: Just parkour.
MATT: That finishes Beau's go.

5759
04:07:00,420 --> 04:07:02,312
Caleb, you're up.
LIAM: Hold for Galactus.

5760
04:07:02,312 --> 04:07:05,960
I am so far away from Vokodo

5761
04:07:05,960 --> 04:07:07,760
that I am just going to try to get closer,

5762
04:07:07,760 --> 04:07:10,320
and I am going to wave my hands in the air

5763
04:07:10,320 --> 04:07:12,610
and cast Expeditious Retreat.
MATT: Okay.

5764
04:07:12,610 --> 04:07:15,850
LIAM: So I can move a full 30
forward towards the cephalopod.

5765
04:07:15,850 --> 04:07:17,642
MATT: You got it. You can drop concentration on a spell

5766
04:07:17,642 --> 04:07:18,930
whenever you want to on your turn, by the way.

5767
04:07:18,930 --> 04:07:20,530
LIAM: I know, but I'm also too far away

5768
04:07:20,530 --> 04:07:22,060
to do anything of real use.

5769
04:07:22,060 --> 04:07:22,970
I want to get closer to him,

5770
04:07:22,970 --> 04:07:24,410
so that is what I want to do.
MATT: Okay.

5771
04:07:24,410 --> 04:07:25,950
LAURA: But you can drop concentration,

5772
04:07:25,950 --> 04:07:27,110
so that you can bring Beau back.

5773
04:07:27,110 --> 04:07:28,630
LIAM: Yes, of course.

5774
04:07:28,630 --> 04:07:30,950
I want Beau to come back, so Beau, come back.

5775
04:07:30,950 --> 04:07:32,247
MATT: There you go, that's what I was asking.

5776
04:07:32,247 --> 04:07:34,770
SAM: (laughs)
MATT: ♪ Beau, come back. ♪

5777
04:07:34,770 --> 04:07:36,150
TRAVIS: ♪ Beau, come back! ♪

5778
04:07:36,150 --> 04:07:38,310
MATT: All right, and with that, Beauregard.

5779
04:07:38,310 --> 04:07:39,860
LIAM: Either way--

5780
04:07:39,860 --> 04:07:41,940
MATT: -- you reappear in the space where you are

5781
04:07:41,940 --> 04:07:44,091
and as soon as you come back,
(rushing)

5782
04:07:44,091 --> 04:07:45,990
you give out two punches and there's nothing there.

5783
04:07:45,990 --> 04:07:46,823
Immediately you look around

5784
04:07:46,823 --> 04:07:48,830
and begin taking stock of how things have shifted,

5785
04:07:48,830 --> 04:07:51,140
with Vokodo moving now further back.

5786
04:07:51,140 --> 04:07:54,481
There's a massive

5787
04:07:55,810 --> 04:07:57,485
astral dreadnought on the opposite side of the chamber

5788
04:07:57,485 --> 04:07:59,220
that is roaring, and for a brief second once again,

5789
04:07:59,220 --> 04:08:00,550
you have to take a moment to remind yourself,

5790
04:08:00,550 --> 04:08:01,850
probably not real.

5791
04:08:01,850 --> 04:08:03,390
Probably.

5792
04:08:03,390 --> 04:08:06,410
So, Caleb. You're moving, Expeditious Retreat.

5793
04:08:06,410 --> 04:08:07,243
LIAM: Straight forward.
MATT: 30.

5794
04:08:07,243 --> 04:08:09,860
LIAM: 30 feet I can do, if I use movement.

5795
04:08:09,860 --> 04:08:11,290
MATT: 30.
LIAM: And my action.

5796
04:08:11,290 --> 04:08:13,530
MATT: Correct.
LIAM: Cast as a bonus.

5797
04:08:13,530 --> 04:08:14,363
MATT: You got it, there you go.

5798
04:08:14,363 --> 04:08:16,840
So you're now 30 feet ahead, and there you are.

5799
04:08:16,840 --> 04:08:17,673
Is that your turn?

5800
04:08:17,673 --> 04:08:19,210
LIAM: That's it. I got nothing else I can do at the moment.

5801
04:08:19,210 --> 04:08:22,580
MATT: All right. Top of the lair action round.

5802
04:08:22,580 --> 04:08:24,803
TRAVIS: Fuck me.
TALIESIN: Hey!

5803
04:08:25,768 --> 04:08:27,610
(laughter)

5804
04:08:27,610 --> 04:08:30,008
TALIESIN: All right.
SAM: Marbles.

5805
04:08:30,008 --> 04:08:32,608
(laughter)

5806
04:08:32,608 --> 04:08:34,270
TALIESIN: Cool. Cool, cool cool, cool.

5807
04:08:34,270 --> 04:08:36,100
MATT: He's going to go ahead, as part of this,

5808
04:08:36,100 --> 04:08:39,020
the eyes shift and look towards Beauregard,

5809
04:08:39,020 --> 04:08:40,763
who's appeared again.
SAM: Oh, no!

5810
04:08:41,740 --> 04:08:44,358
MATT: And you feel this strange
sparkle sensation around you,

5811
04:08:44,358 --> 04:08:46,490
(impact)
as the Bless is dispelled.

5812
04:08:46,490 --> 04:08:47,920
SAM: Oh. Okay.

5813
04:08:47,920 --> 04:08:49,520
Not so bad.
LIAM: Okay, not so bad.

5814
04:08:50,820 --> 04:08:52,820
LIAM: Just on everything.

5815
04:08:52,820 --> 04:08:54,695
TRAVIS: She can't talk. Where'd she go?

5816
04:08:54,695 --> 04:08:58,180
(laughter)

5817
04:08:58,180 --> 04:09:01,870
MARISHA: I'm literally drawing
pictures of a giant space whale

5818
04:09:01,870 --> 04:09:04,883
with Beau just trapped in space.

5819
04:09:04,883 --> 04:09:06,606
LAURA: Oh, no!
MARISHA: My catharsis doodle right now.

5820
04:09:06,606 --> 04:09:09,681
LIAM: You just turned into a Pink
Floyd album for six seconds.

5821
04:09:09,681 --> 04:09:11,500
MARISHA: (laughs) I did.

5822
04:09:11,500 --> 04:09:16,425
MATT: Vilya's going to go ahead
and now swim forward 60 feet.

5823
04:09:17,308 --> 04:09:18,799
TRAVIS: Let's go!

5824
04:09:18,799 --> 04:09:20,305
LIAM: ♪ Wish you were here. ♪

5825
04:09:20,305 --> 04:09:22,933
MATT: 30.
MARISHA: (laughs)

5826
04:09:22,933 --> 04:09:24,790
MATT: She's going to be right about here.

5827
04:09:24,790 --> 04:09:25,870
MARISHA: I'm on fire.

5828
04:09:25,870 --> 04:09:26,703
TRAVIS: She's so close.

5829
04:09:26,703 --> 04:09:30,130
That's, like, 15 feet out of melee?

5830
04:09:30,130 --> 04:09:31,488
MATT: Correct.

5831
04:09:33,520 --> 04:09:35,730
Does not want causing lightning

5832
04:09:35,730 --> 04:09:36,580
to hit anybody else,

5833
04:09:36,580 --> 04:09:41,445
so is going to drop concentration spell

5834
04:09:41,445 --> 04:09:43,500
and is going to use her action to move up,

5835
04:09:44,550 --> 04:09:47,440
to swim up as an orca on the other side of Vokodo.

5836
04:09:47,440 --> 04:09:48,273
TRAVIS: Nice.

5837
04:09:48,273 --> 04:09:49,230
MATT: And try and pincer him there.

5838
04:09:49,230 --> 04:09:50,360
Can't get an attack this round,

5839
04:09:50,360 --> 04:09:53,900
but is at least just starting to close him into that space.

5840
04:09:53,900 --> 04:09:56,210
Finishing Vilya's turn, it is now Vokodo's turn.

5841
04:09:56,210 --> 04:09:58,970
Top of Vokodo's turn, everybody takes...

5842
04:09:58,970 --> 04:10:01,949
TRAVIS: Everybody takes!
MATT: Eight points of fire damage.

5843
04:10:01,949 --> 04:10:04,018
ASHLEY: ♪ Everybody take, everybody take. ♪

5844
04:10:04,018 --> 04:10:04,851
LIAM: No.

5845
04:10:04,851 --> 04:10:06,605
SAM and MARISHA: ♪ Everybody take, everybody take! ♪

5846
04:10:06,605 --> 04:10:07,438
TRAVIS: (grunting in rhythm)

5847
04:10:07,438 --> 04:10:09,495
LIAM: ♪ Everybody take, everybody take. ♪

5848
04:10:09,495 --> 04:10:11,911
SAM: ♪ Everybody take fire damage! ♪

5849
04:10:11,911 --> 04:10:14,290
(laughter)

5850
04:10:14,290 --> 04:10:17,865
TALIESIN: You know, it's kind of nice
in another dimension right now.

5851
04:10:19,724 --> 04:10:20,732
I'm feeling pretty chill.

5852
04:10:20,732 --> 04:10:23,718
TRAVIS: This is nice.
TALIESIN: This is fine.

5853
04:10:23,718 --> 04:10:25,040
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Just floating.

5854
04:10:25,040 --> 04:10:27,610
LIAM: Eight total?
MATT: Eight total, yes.

5855
04:10:27,610 --> 04:10:30,918
LIAM: Thank you.
LAURA: Caduceus is so happy.

5856
04:10:30,918 --> 04:10:35,918
SAM: Do three weird people in two-dimensional glass...

5857
04:10:36,174 --> 04:10:38,200
TALIESIN: (imitates choral singing)
SAM: ...glass things just float by?

5858
04:10:38,200 --> 04:10:39,080
TALIESIN: Phantom Zone?

5859
04:10:39,080 --> 04:10:42,740
MATT: Vokodo, furiously now, at this point, surrounded,

5860
04:10:42,740 --> 04:10:47,190
angrily is going to attempt to move this way

5861
04:10:47,190 --> 04:10:49,290
to get out of the pincered scenario.

5862
04:10:49,290 --> 04:10:52,700
So he's going to shift away from Vilya,

5863
04:10:52,700 --> 04:10:54,730
which does get an attack of opportunity on him

5864
04:10:54,730 --> 04:10:56,550
with the giant orca.

5865
04:10:56,550 --> 04:10:58,931
TALIESIN: When you get an attack
of opportunity, shit's fucked.

5866
04:10:58,931 --> 04:11:01,240
LAURA: And Yasha gets to hit him!
ASHLEY: Do I get an Attack?

5867
04:11:01,240 --> 04:11:04,830
MATT: You do when we get to it.
TRAVIS: You are back.

5868
04:11:04,830 --> 04:11:06,440
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: She's conscious.

5869
04:11:06,440 --> 04:11:08,250
SAM: But you have willpower?

5870
04:11:08,250 --> 04:11:09,390
LIAM: Yeah, she's back.
SAM: Oh, wow.

5871
04:11:09,390 --> 04:11:11,310
MATT: So, Vilya's going to attack there with this,

5872
04:11:11,310 --> 04:11:13,770
which is a plus six to hit.

5873
04:11:13,770 --> 04:11:15,730
Misses, unfortunately.

5874
04:11:15,730 --> 04:11:19,203
Yasha, however, as Vokodo shifts around this way

5875
04:11:19,203 --> 04:11:22,010
and attempts to move out of that space this way,

5876
04:11:22,010 --> 04:11:24,203
go ahead and make an attack of opportunity.

5877
04:11:24,203 --> 04:11:25,688
ASHLEY: Wait!

5878
04:11:28,900 --> 04:11:32,131
I don't have a--
LAURA: Add a d4, add a d4!

5879
04:11:32,131 --> 04:11:36,058
(intense music)

5880
04:11:36,058 --> 04:11:37,862
SAM: (humming to music)

5881
04:11:37,862 --> 04:11:40,845
LIAM: Man, wouldn't it be great if Dieter were here?

5882
04:11:40,845 --> 04:11:41,678
LAURA: (laughs)

5883
04:11:41,678 --> 04:11:43,760
SAM: What if he shows up right now?

5884
04:11:43,760 --> 04:11:44,870
LAURA: That'd be so great.
ASHLEY: 12.

5885
04:11:44,870 --> 04:11:48,900
MARISHA: "I changed my mind!"
MATT: 12 misses.

5886
04:11:48,900 --> 04:11:51,000
He is forced to the ground, however.

5887
04:11:51,000 --> 04:11:53,730
Is not floating, not swimming above, but is now,

5888
04:11:53,730 --> 04:11:55,460
because of the astral dreadnought, pushed away,

5889
04:11:55,460 --> 04:11:58,690
and is going to go ahead and shift angrily this way.

5890
04:11:58,690 --> 04:12:00,326
TRAVIS: You're not raging or anything yet?

5891
04:12:00,326 --> 04:12:03,420
TALIESIN: Not yet.
ASHLEY: No.

5892
04:12:03,420 --> 04:12:05,830
SAM: No, Travis! No.
MATT: Moving away from that,

5893
04:12:05,830 --> 04:12:07,660
furious as the swings move behind.

5894
04:12:10,480 --> 04:12:12,450
Sees you, as the arcane caster, Caleb--

5895
04:12:12,450 --> 04:12:14,200
LIAM: Oh, yeah, good. Very good.

5896
04:12:14,200 --> 04:12:16,300
MATT: -- and angrily is going to go ahead and focus.

5897
04:12:17,200 --> 04:12:20,790
Mouth opens up, and you see the glow of heat on the inside

5898
04:12:20,790 --> 04:12:23,420
begin to glow bright, bright, bright.

5899
04:12:23,420 --> 04:12:26,600
Then you see (crackling).

5900
04:12:26,600 --> 04:12:28,390
It looks similar to the energy

5901
04:12:28,390 --> 04:12:32,210
that swirls around Yasha when she was playing her harp,

5902
04:12:32,210 --> 04:12:34,300
or similar to the bolts of lightning

5903
04:12:34,300 --> 04:12:35,660
that were being drawn from the storm above.

5904
04:12:35,660 --> 04:12:39,000
It's now starting to dissipate above the chamber.

5905
04:12:39,000 --> 04:12:40,280
But it's red.

5906
04:12:40,280 --> 04:12:44,680
Whenever you see those images of tornadoes or volcanoes

5907
04:12:44,680 --> 04:12:47,630
with the red lightning storms around it,

5908
04:12:47,630 --> 04:12:50,730
this charges up (crackling, bursting)

5909
04:12:50,730 --> 04:12:51,800
and fires out towards you.

5910
04:12:51,800 --> 04:12:55,180
LIAM: Is this a casting? Counterspell.

5911
04:12:55,180 --> 04:12:56,900
MATT: Counterspell, all right.
LAURA: (groaning)

5912
04:12:56,900 --> 04:12:58,510
Go ahead and roll to counter it.

5913
04:12:58,510 --> 04:13:00,220
SAM and LIAM: (exaggerated German accent) Counterspell.

5914
04:13:00,220 --> 04:13:01,880
MATT: So, roll a d20, add your Intelligence modifier.

5915
04:13:01,880 --> 04:13:03,020
SAM: Counterspell.

5916
04:13:03,020 --> 04:13:04,450
LIAM: Add my Intelligence modifier?

5917
04:13:04,450 --> 04:13:06,940
MATT: Yeah.
LIAM: Okay. It's 28.

5918
04:13:06,940 --> 04:13:09,120
SAM: Ooh!
MATT: Not your saving throw.

5919
04:13:09,120 --> 04:13:09,953
Your Intelligence modifier.

5920
04:13:09,953 --> 04:13:12,390
LIAM: Oh, my modifier? Then it's a 23.

5921
04:13:12,390 --> 04:13:13,610
SAM: Ooh!
MATT: 23.

5922
04:13:13,610 --> 04:13:14,782
Fucking Counterspell, man.

5923
04:13:14,782 --> 04:13:17,582
(laughter and cheering)

5924
04:13:17,582 --> 04:13:19,550
ASHLEY: Yes!
SAM: What was that going to be?

5925
04:13:19,550 --> 04:13:21,650
TRAVIS: Fuck.
MATT: You'll never know.

5926
04:13:21,650 --> 04:13:24,897
TRAVIS: Red Lightning of Pain and Misery.

5927
04:13:24,897 --> 04:13:26,320
LIAM: Would've been my total hit points.

5928
04:13:26,320 --> 04:13:28,220
TRAVIS: Yeah, could've been.

5929
04:13:28,220 --> 04:13:31,073
MATT: Okay, that's going to finish Vokodo's turn.

5930
04:13:33,058 --> 04:13:34,060
(laughter)

5931
04:13:34,060 --> 04:13:36,090
TRAVIS: We love you, Matt. This is amazing.

5932
04:13:36,090 --> 04:13:38,310
TALIESIN: Still dying, man. Still dying.

5933
04:13:38,310 --> 04:13:39,143
MATT: Yasha, you're up.

5934
04:13:39,143 --> 04:13:40,234
SAM: You're the DM!
LAURA: Yasha!

5935
04:13:40,234 --> 04:13:42,850
SAM: You can just say there's no more Counterspelling.

5936
04:13:42,850 --> 04:13:43,770
MATT: No!

5937
04:13:43,770 --> 04:13:46,120
LIAM: Just nix it.
MATT: No, Counterspell's great.

5938
04:13:46,120 --> 04:13:47,336
It's going to be really great

5939
04:13:47,336 --> 04:13:48,760
when other mages start fighting you guys,

5940
04:13:48,760 --> 04:13:49,730
because then I can just counter all your shit.

5941
04:13:49,730 --> 04:13:51,060
LIAM: Not going to happen this story.

5942
04:13:51,060 --> 04:13:53,860
MATT: No, not at all. There's no
other mages possibly in the narrative.

5943
04:13:53,860 --> 04:13:55,151
TRAVIS: Nope!

5944
04:13:55,151 --> 04:13:55,993
MATT: Yasha.

5945
04:13:55,993 --> 04:13:58,460
ASHLEY: For starters, I would like to rage!

5946
04:13:58,460 --> 04:14:00,130
ALL: Yeah!

5947
04:14:00,130 --> 04:14:02,250
SAM: About time.
ASHLEY: Okay.

5948
04:14:03,450 --> 04:14:06,295
SAM: Let's do this.
ASHLEY: All right.

5949
04:14:06,295 --> 04:14:08,450
LAURA: (laughs)

5950
04:14:08,450 --> 04:14:10,800
ASHLEY: Fucking piece of shit!

5951
04:14:10,800 --> 04:14:12,420
MATT: Are you moving towards him?

5952
04:14:12,420 --> 04:14:14,782
ASHLEY: Yes, I'm going to move towards him.

5953
04:14:14,782 --> 04:14:16,510
(laughter)
MATT: 5, 10, 15, 20.

5954
04:14:16,510 --> 04:14:19,270
You swim up just enough to get into combat.

5955
04:14:19,270 --> 04:14:21,220
So first, are you doing reckless or--?

5956
04:14:23,780 --> 04:14:25,180
ASHLEY: Wait, did I just roll one?

5957
04:14:27,530 --> 04:14:29,430
No, because rage-- yes, yes.

5958
04:14:29,430 --> 04:14:31,200
Yeah, I'm going to do reckless.

5959
04:14:31,200 --> 04:14:33,033
I'm going to do reckless.

5960
04:14:34,590 --> 04:14:36,740
That's worse. Okay.

5961
04:14:36,740 --> 04:14:39,931
ASHLEY: (stammering)

5962
04:14:39,931 --> 04:14:41,397
What was the initial?

5963
04:14:42,960 --> 04:14:44,240
I'm so sorry.
MATT: It's okay.

5964
04:14:44,240 --> 04:14:45,073
TALIESIN: Welcome back.

5965
04:14:46,498 --> 04:14:47,540
MATT: And Jester, you're next.

5966
04:14:47,540 --> 04:14:49,090
LAURA: Oh.
ASHLEY: 15 for the first hit.

5967
04:14:49,090 --> 04:14:50,540
TRAVIS: And a d4 for Bless?

5968
04:14:50,540 --> 04:14:52,760
ASHLEY: That's with the d4.
TALIESIN: Is that with the d4? Fuck.

5969
04:14:52,760 --> 04:14:54,700
MATT: You swing wide.

5970
04:14:54,700 --> 04:14:56,920
As you're catching up, you thought you were closer

5971
04:14:56,920 --> 04:14:58,800
and you miss it by inches.

5972
04:14:58,800 --> 04:15:00,100
Using the momentum as you back-swing,

5973
04:15:00,100 --> 04:15:02,276
you can go in for another strike upward.

5974
04:15:02,276 --> 04:15:05,116
ASHLEY: Natural one.

5975
04:15:05,116 --> 04:15:07,073
MATT: (sighing)
TRAVIS: Wow.

5976
04:15:07,073 --> 04:15:08,490
MATT: Wait, natural one on both die?

5977
04:15:08,490 --> 04:15:09,360
ASHLEY: Oh, no, no, no.

5978
04:15:09,360 --> 04:15:10,710
I didn't roll twice.

5979
04:15:12,640 --> 04:15:13,740
I rolled two natural ones.

5980
04:15:13,740 --> 04:15:15,460
MARISHA: No way!

5981
04:15:15,460 --> 04:15:17,525
MATT: Ashley!
TRAVIS: What is going on?

5982
04:15:17,525 --> 04:15:19,480
ASHLEY: I don't know what's happening.
TALIESIN: All of those dice are gone forever now.

5983
04:15:19,480 --> 04:15:20,313
You got to--
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5984
04:15:20,313 --> 04:15:22,260
LAURA: I don't know how to get it to you.

5985
04:15:22,260 --> 04:15:24,273
ASHLEY: No, no, no, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay.

5986
04:15:24,273 --> 04:15:27,182
MATT: Ashley!
LAURA: Here's my whole bag.

5987
04:15:27,182 --> 04:15:28,015
MATT: All right.

5988
04:15:28,015 --> 04:15:30,100
You were already raging.

5989
04:15:30,100 --> 04:15:33,949
Now you are fucking furious!

5990
04:15:33,949 --> 04:15:36,359
MARISHA: Wow. That's rough.

5991
04:15:36,359 --> 04:15:37,770
MATT: All right, that finishes your turn, Yasha.

5992
04:15:37,770 --> 04:15:39,340
Jester, you're up. Veth, you're on deck.

5993
04:15:39,340 --> 04:15:40,400
ASHLEY: Just Weakest Link me right now.

5994
04:15:40,400 --> 04:15:42,880
LIAM: Do you want me to send you to the Astral--?

5995
04:15:42,880 --> 04:15:45,635
TALIESIN: It's nice.
ASHLEY: No. (sighs)

5996
04:15:45,635 --> 04:15:46,468
SAM: You know why?

5997
04:15:46,468 --> 04:15:48,360
It's because Yasha didn't sleep well last night,

5998
04:15:48,360 --> 04:15:49,960
because of your dreams.

5999
04:15:49,960 --> 04:15:51,600
LAURA: I'm going to drop one Banishment.

6000
04:15:52,450 --> 04:15:53,700
Wait, but I'm going to wait.

6001
04:15:54,974 --> 04:15:56,970
Because I'm going to cast another Banishment,

6002
04:15:56,970 --> 04:15:58,960
so it's going to cancel, probably.

6003
04:15:58,960 --> 04:16:00,380
MATT: Yeah, that'll happen.
LAURA: Yeah.

6004
04:16:00,380 --> 04:16:01,980
MATT: Okay, cast another Banishment.

6005
04:16:05,021 --> 04:16:06,320
That is a charisma, right?

6006
04:16:06,320 --> 04:16:07,153
LAURA: Yeah.

6007
04:16:08,710 --> 04:16:10,820
MATT: As he's rushing away from the creature,

6008
04:16:10,820 --> 04:16:12,100
and Yasha's missing,

6009
04:16:12,100 --> 04:16:15,490
that large bolt of energy that strikes out and vanishes.

6010
04:16:15,490 --> 04:16:16,590
Furiously, you can see

6011
04:16:16,590 --> 04:16:19,200
its eyes are growing brighter and brighter with anger.

6012
04:16:19,200 --> 04:16:20,780
It's still looking back with one eye

6013
04:16:20,780 --> 04:16:21,613
at the astral dreadnought,

6014
04:16:21,613 --> 04:16:24,193
and then (rushing) it vanishes from view.

6015
04:16:24,193 --> 04:16:25,090
TRAVIS: Where'd you send him? Where'd you send him?

6016
04:16:25,090 --> 04:16:27,225
Where'd you send him?

6017
04:16:27,225 --> 04:16:30,110
LAURA: To the Astral Sea.

6018
04:16:30,110 --> 04:16:30,943
To his home plane.

6019
04:16:30,943 --> 04:16:32,050
MATT: If they're from something else,

6020
04:16:32,050 --> 04:16:34,020
it sends them back to their home plane, yeah.

6021
04:16:34,020 --> 04:16:36,050
TRAVIS: Which is--

6022
04:16:36,050 --> 04:16:38,320
LAURA: As long as I can keep the concentration up,

6023
04:16:38,320 --> 04:16:39,153
he'll stay there.

6024
04:16:39,153 --> 04:16:41,295
TALIESIN: And then I bounce back?
MATT: And you bounce back.

6025
04:16:41,295 --> 04:16:42,128
TALIESIN: Ah!

6026
04:16:42,128 --> 04:16:44,687
SAM: My god, he turned into Caduceus!

6027
04:16:44,687 --> 04:16:46,685
(laughter)

6028
04:16:46,685 --> 04:16:48,080
LAURA: Bless me!
SAM: Kill Caduceus!

6029
04:16:48,080 --> 04:16:51,300
SAM: Bless me! Do something
so I don't drop my concentration!

6030
04:16:51,300 --> 04:16:53,930
MARISHA: We should get you out of here.

6031
04:16:53,930 --> 04:16:55,470
SAM: Oh, there's lair actions.

6032
04:16:55,470 --> 04:16:56,733
Everyone get around Jester. Protect her!

6033
04:16:56,733 --> 04:16:58,584
MARISHA: We should get you out of here.

6034
04:16:58,584 --> 04:16:59,870
Okay.
LIAM: Ja.

6035
04:16:59,870 --> 04:17:01,770
Caleb swims in and starts looking

6036
04:17:01,770 --> 04:17:03,530
for any kind of--
SAM: Can you just make a shield?

6037
04:17:03,530 --> 04:17:04,640
LIAM: Other than the boiling water.

6038
04:17:04,640 --> 04:17:06,040
LAURA: The water's hot! The water's hot!

6039
04:17:06,040 --> 04:17:07,863
We should get out before I take damage!

6040
04:17:07,863 --> 04:17:09,630
MATT: So, Jester.
LAURA: What?

6041
04:17:09,630 --> 04:17:12,847
MATT: What else are you doing on your turn? Is that it?

6042
04:17:12,847 --> 04:17:16,020
LAURA: Oh. Um.
TALIESIN: Run?

6043
04:17:16,020 --> 04:17:17,710
MARISHA: Swim!
MATT: I'm going to turn around

6044
04:17:17,710 --> 04:17:20,240
and start swimming to get out of here.

6045
04:17:20,240 --> 04:17:21,673
MATT: Okay.

6046
04:17:22,547 --> 04:17:23,647
5, 10, 15-
(screen clattering)

6047
04:17:23,647 --> 04:17:25,310
MATT: Oh god!
ALL: Ah!

6048
04:17:25,310 --> 04:17:26,443
MATT: Oh god, oh no!

6049
04:17:26,443 --> 04:17:28,710
TRAVIS: (laughs) That scared the shit out of me!

6050
04:17:28,710 --> 04:17:29,650
(laughter)
MATT: Good!

6051
04:17:29,650 --> 04:17:31,230
That'll teach you to pay attention!

6052
04:17:31,230 --> 04:17:33,410
TRAVIS: Fuck me!

6053
04:17:33,410 --> 04:17:35,390
MATT: It happens on occasion.
TRAVIS: He's back!

6054
04:17:35,390 --> 04:17:36,990
MATT: All right, so that gets you--

6055
04:17:38,450 --> 04:17:40,730
ASHLEY: Will he be gone forever if you just--

6056
04:17:40,730 --> 04:17:42,788
LIAM: If she doesn't get fucked up.
ASHLEY: If you don't get fucked up.

6057
04:17:42,788 --> 04:17:44,840
LIAM: For a minute.
SAM: She's about to take heat damage.

6058
04:17:44,840 --> 04:17:45,673
ASHLEY: For a minute.

6059
04:17:45,673 --> 04:17:46,663
MATT: Yeah, so you get about there, Jester.

6060
04:17:46,663 --> 04:17:48,870
LAURA: But I took War Caster, so--
MATT: Okay, good.

6061
04:17:48,870 --> 04:17:50,570
LIAM: So chances are decent.

6062
04:17:50,570 --> 04:17:53,380
MARISHA: You just have to roll over damage,

6063
04:17:53,380 --> 04:17:54,670
and the heat damage has been low.

6064
04:17:54,670 --> 04:17:56,970
MATT: Finishes your turn, Jester. Veth, you're up.

6065
04:17:58,326 --> 04:18:02,100
SAM: (exhales heavily)

6066
04:18:02,100 --> 04:18:05,990
I'm going to swim down and hide in those rocks,

6067
04:18:05,990 --> 04:18:08,380
and prepare and hold my shot

6068
04:18:08,380 --> 04:18:11,280
until the thing comes back.

6069
04:18:11,280 --> 04:18:12,407
Until the thing.

6070
04:18:12,407 --> 04:18:13,390
MATT: You're hiding in those rocks right there?
SAM: Yeah.

6071
04:18:13,390 --> 04:18:14,223
MATT: You got it.

6072
04:18:14,223 --> 04:18:16,470
SAM: Hiding and waiting, and if I see it, I fire.

6073
04:18:16,470 --> 04:18:18,912
MATT: You got it. Roll a stealth check.

6074
04:18:20,280 --> 04:18:22,110
SAM: 25.

6075
04:18:22,110 --> 04:18:25,680
MATT: Okay. Caduceus, you're up, and then it's Fjord.

6076
04:18:25,680 --> 04:18:29,230
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to--

6077
04:18:29,230 --> 04:18:31,070
LIAM: Where is Jester there?

6078
04:18:31,070 --> 04:18:33,420
MARISHA: She's over here by the--
SAM: At the door.

6079
04:18:33,420 --> 04:18:34,380
MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: She's at the door.

6080
04:18:34,380 --> 04:18:38,940
I'm going to re-cast Bless.
MATT: Re-cast Bless?

6081
04:18:38,940 --> 04:18:42,580
TALIESIN: At level three. Who's within 30 feet of me?

6082
04:18:42,580 --> 04:18:44,570
MATT: Everybody except for Yasha.

6083
04:18:44,570 --> 04:18:47,660
TALIESIN: Okay.
MATT: So, Yasha's Bless goes away.

6084
04:18:47,660 --> 04:18:49,890
TALIESIN: Yeah.

6085
04:18:49,890 --> 04:18:52,470
Let's see, I'm doing-- it's five targets?

6086
04:18:52,470 --> 04:18:57,247
So one, two, three,

6087
04:18:59,960 --> 04:19:02,140
four...

6088
04:19:02,140 --> 04:19:03,750
I can't.

6089
04:19:03,750 --> 04:19:06,100
Eenie meenie miney, five.

6090
04:19:06,100 --> 04:19:07,349
We need those things to stay.

6091
04:19:07,349 --> 04:19:09,559
MARISHA: Not you.
MATT: So, who is it?

6092
04:19:10,500 --> 04:19:12,740
TALIESIN: Everybody but Sam.
MATT: At 3rd-level?

6093
04:19:12,740 --> 04:19:13,880
You can get five people.

6094
04:19:13,880 --> 04:19:16,810
TALIESIN: Yeah. One, two, three, four, five.

6095
04:19:16,810 --> 04:19:18,480
MATT: So, Jester and Caleb?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

6096
04:19:18,480 --> 04:19:20,650
MATT: Okay. So Veth loses it.

6097
04:19:20,650 --> 04:19:23,292
TALIESIN: Everybody but Yasha and Veth.

6098
04:19:23,292 --> 04:19:24,847
LIAM: That's a blessy Bless?

6099
04:19:24,847 --> 04:19:25,870
TALIESIN: It's an extra d4

6100
04:19:25,870 --> 04:19:28,360
on attacks and saves.
LIAM: Attacks and saves.

6101
04:19:28,360 --> 04:19:29,750
MATT: Okay, you got it.

6102
04:19:29,750 --> 04:19:31,170
TALIESIN: And I would've given you Freedom of Movement,

6103
04:19:31,170 --> 04:19:32,003
but it was one or the other.

6104
04:19:32,003 --> 04:19:33,970
And then I'm going to spend the rest of my turn

6105
04:19:33,970 --> 04:19:37,410
moving in the direction of (whistles).

6106
04:19:37,410 --> 04:19:40,230
LIAM: Remember, it took 10 or 15 or 20 minutes

6107
04:19:40,230 --> 04:19:43,054
to get through the tunnels to get here, so that's--

6108
04:19:43,054 --> 04:19:44,150
MATT: Yeah.

6109
04:19:44,150 --> 04:19:46,130
TALIESIN: Yeah.

6110
04:19:46,130 --> 04:19:50,850
LIAM: Freedom of Movement.
MATT: That brings us to Fjord.

6111
04:19:50,850 --> 04:19:54,940
TRAVIS: Yes. We're running, right?

6112
04:19:54,940 --> 04:19:59,010
LAURA: I mean, I don't know.
TRAVIS: We're trying to get you out.

6113
04:19:59,010 --> 04:20:00,680
LAURA: I don't-- It's not like we--

6114
04:20:00,680 --> 04:20:01,840
LIAM: We need to last.

6115
04:20:01,840 --> 04:20:03,610
LAURA: We just need to last for a minute.

6116
04:20:04,920 --> 04:20:06,900
If I can keep it up for a minute.

6117
04:20:06,900 --> 04:20:08,366
SAM: You've just got to get out of the lair.

6118
04:20:08,366 --> 04:20:10,170
LIAM: We will not get through those tunnels.

6119
04:20:10,170 --> 04:20:12,667
Never mind.
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's true.

6120
04:20:12,667 --> 04:20:13,500
LIAM: (pigeon cooing)

6121
04:20:13,500 --> 04:20:17,590
TRAVIS: I am going to--
SAM: Underwater pigeon. (cooing)

6122
04:20:17,590 --> 04:20:18,850
MATT: You get the sense the tunnels,

6123
04:20:18,850 --> 04:20:20,160
and the water you came from,

6124
04:20:20,160 --> 04:20:21,805
is all similarly heated.

6125
04:20:21,805 --> 04:20:24,500
So going isn't going to change anything.

6126
04:20:24,500 --> 04:20:25,860
TRAVIS: I'm going to move the astral dreadnought

6127
04:20:25,860 --> 04:20:28,720
to the middle, above Yasha.

6128
04:20:28,720 --> 04:20:30,228
MATT: How long does that last for?

6129
04:20:30,228 --> 04:20:31,260
TRAVIS: 10 minutes.

6130
04:20:31,260 --> 04:20:33,130
MATT: 10 minutes, you got it, yeah.

6131
04:20:33,130 --> 04:20:36,166
TRAVIS: It's not real, Yasha!

6132
04:20:36,166 --> 04:20:40,180
I'm going to swim over to where Jester is and just hover.

6133
04:20:40,180 --> 04:20:43,640
MATT: Okay. You've got it.
TRAVIS: I have 30 feet.

6134
04:20:43,640 --> 04:20:45,080
MATT: Okay. So you--

6135
04:20:45,080 --> 04:20:47,460
TRAVIS: I'll put myself, I guess, in front of her.

6136
04:20:47,460 --> 04:20:50,080
LAURA: Do you have ice armor?
MATT: Right here?

6137
04:20:50,080 --> 04:20:51,538
LAURA: Is your armor cold?

6138
04:20:53,971 --> 04:20:55,510
TRAVIS: Can I put that on somebody else?

6139
04:20:55,510 --> 04:20:56,741
MATT: No.
TRAVIS: I can't.

6140
04:20:56,741 --> 04:20:57,910
MATT: It's only on self for that.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

6141
04:21:00,030 --> 04:21:01,590
MATT: All right. Beau, Caleb?

6142
04:21:01,590 --> 04:21:05,820
MARISHA: I'm going to swim opposite where Fjord just went,

6143
04:21:05,820 --> 04:21:07,720
and also just try to be nearby

6144
04:21:07,720 --> 04:21:09,902
to protect Jester.
MATT: Right here, you mean?

6145
04:21:09,902 --> 04:21:11,460
MARISHA: No, no, no, no.
MATT: Oh, over here?

6146
04:21:11,460 --> 04:21:14,180
MARISHA: Yeah. Team Protect Jester.

6147
04:21:14,180 --> 04:21:17,080
MATT: Yeah, you can get right here. Not an issue.

6148
04:21:17,080 --> 04:21:19,187
MARISHA: I don't know what I'd protect her from.

6149
04:21:19,187 --> 04:21:21,240
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: But that's what I got.

6150
04:21:21,240 --> 04:21:25,800
And I'll hold my action in case he comes back.

6151
04:21:25,800 --> 04:21:29,153
MATT: You got it. Veth, you're just staying hidden?

6152
04:21:29,153 --> 04:21:33,220
SAM: We're not leaving?
LAURA: No, stay hidden.

6153
04:21:33,220 --> 04:21:36,690
LIAM: I'm after Beau for initiative.

6154
04:21:36,690 --> 04:21:37,523
MATT: Yeah. Oh, that's right, sorry.

6155
04:21:37,523 --> 04:21:38,660
I forgot right there.

6156
04:21:38,660 --> 04:21:40,440
LIAM: It's okay.
MATT: Sorry.

6157
04:21:40,440 --> 04:21:42,490
LIAM: Caleb swims directly towards Jester

6158
04:21:42,490 --> 04:21:44,910
and pulls out his Transmuter Stone,

6159
04:21:44,910 --> 04:21:46,570
and shoves it into her hand,

6160
04:21:46,570 --> 04:21:49,790
the lucky stone with the band around it.

6161
04:21:49,790 --> 04:21:52,580
It is set to adding proficiency

6162
04:21:53,440 --> 04:21:55,660
to constitution saves right now.

6163
04:21:55,660 --> 04:21:57,100
So you're going to add your proficiency

6164
04:21:57,100 --> 04:21:58,810
to any concentration check you make

6165
04:21:58,810 --> 04:22:01,060
to hold Banishment.
LAURA: Oh, great! Okay.

6166
04:22:01,060 --> 04:22:03,810
LIAM: As long as it's in a person's possession,

6167
04:22:03,810 --> 04:22:05,218
they get that ability.
MATT: Okay.

6168
04:22:05,218 --> 04:22:06,370
TRAVIS: Cool, cool.

6169
04:22:06,370 --> 04:22:07,330
LIAM: That's the end of my turn.

6170
04:22:07,330 --> 04:22:10,200
LAURA: That's great, okay.
MATT: All righty.

6171
04:22:11,110 --> 04:22:15,000
So that brings us to everyone taking...

6172
04:22:16,710 --> 04:22:18,610
seven points of fire damage.

6173
04:22:18,610 --> 04:22:20,454
SAM: Yikes.

6174
04:22:20,454 --> 04:22:21,870
MATT: So if everyone's holding,

6175
04:22:21,870 --> 04:22:23,240
we'll come to Yasha in a second.

6176
04:22:23,240 --> 04:22:24,648
MATT: Go ahead and roll two d20s.

6177
04:22:24,648 --> 04:22:25,923
LAURA: Two? Okay.

6178
04:22:25,923 --> 04:22:27,530
MATT: Because you have War Caster.
LAURA: Okay.

6179
04:22:27,530 --> 04:22:29,320
MATT: Because you have to maintain concentration

6180
04:22:29,320 --> 04:22:30,260
every time you take fire damage.

6181
04:22:30,260 --> 04:22:31,093
LAURA: Right.

6182
04:22:33,210 --> 04:22:36,310
Without a roll, it's already seven.

6183
04:22:36,310 --> 04:22:40,330
MATT: Correct. So you have to get above a 10, total.

6184
04:22:40,330 --> 04:22:41,830
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: Or a 10 or above.

6185
04:22:41,830 --> 04:22:43,280
TRAVIS: And you get Bless and stuff, right?

6186
04:22:43,280 --> 04:22:44,790
LIAM: And you add your proficiency bonus too.

6187
04:22:44,790 --> 04:22:47,400
LAURA: Right, okay. Oh, way, way great.

6188
04:22:47,400 --> 04:22:48,630
MATT: Okay. So, that's the first round.

6189
04:22:48,630 --> 04:22:50,470
LAURA: 15 plus seven.
MATT: You're fine.

6190
04:22:50,470 --> 04:22:51,303
LAURA: Plus a four.

6191
04:22:51,303 --> 04:22:52,565
MATT: Okay. Yasha, what are you doing?

6192
04:22:54,080 --> 04:22:56,435
ASHLEY: (sighs) All right.

6193
04:23:00,309 --> 04:23:02,060
I'm going to hang out here by this thing.

6194
04:23:02,060 --> 04:23:03,660
MATT: Okay, yeah. If we're all hanging here,

6195
04:23:03,660 --> 04:23:05,785
we're going to do a bunch of rounds of fire damage

6196
04:23:05,785 --> 04:23:08,192
and saves to see if we can make it.

6197
04:23:08,192 --> 04:23:10,090
So that's nine we have left to do.

6198
04:23:10,090 --> 04:23:11,980
SAM: Nine rounds?

6199
04:23:11,980 --> 04:23:13,530
MATT: Ooh. Everyone takes eight points of fire damage.

6200
04:23:13,530 --> 04:23:15,110
SAM: Yikes.
LIAM: Wow.

6201
04:23:15,110 --> 04:23:18,030
MARISHA: If anyone wants to heal...
LAURA: Natural 20!

6202
04:23:18,890 --> 04:23:19,723
MATT: Great!

6203
04:23:19,723 --> 04:23:21,410
MARISHA: Did you say eight or nine damage?

6204
04:23:21,410 --> 04:23:22,360
MATT: Eight damage.

6205
04:23:22,360 --> 04:23:24,410
TRAVIS: I actually will--
LAURA: We should heal.

6206
04:23:24,410 --> 04:23:26,500
TRAVIS: I'm going to try and swim to the top of this cavern

6207
04:23:26,500 --> 04:23:27,850
and just see what's up here,

6208
04:23:27,850 --> 04:23:28,970
since we're doing it.
MATT: Okay.

6209
04:23:28,970 --> 04:23:30,180
LAURA: Caduceus, can you heal people?

6210
04:23:30,180 --> 04:23:31,258
TALIESIN: Yeah.

6211
04:23:31,258 --> 04:23:34,430
I was going to. I can do a--
TRAVIS: I'll do double dashes,

6212
04:23:34,430 --> 04:23:36,273
so 60 feet each time.

6213
04:23:36,273 --> 04:23:38,430
MATT: We'll say you're up at the very, very top.

6214
04:23:38,430 --> 04:23:39,400
TRAVIS: Cool.

6215
04:23:39,400 --> 04:23:41,310
MATT: Vilya's going to move.
TRAVIS: Just to see if it's liquid all the way,

6216
04:23:41,310 --> 04:23:42,890
or if it's air or--

6217
04:23:42,890 --> 04:23:44,770
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to--
TRAVIS: Magic elevator.

6218
04:23:44,770 --> 04:23:45,918
MATT: No air.

6219
04:23:45,918 --> 04:23:48,560
TALIESIN: I'm going to use our six seconds to--

6220
04:23:48,560 --> 04:23:50,029
LIAM: Other spells that are not concentration.

6221
04:23:50,029 --> 04:23:51,570
LAURA: Okay.
TALIESIN: Yeah. So I'm going to use

6222
04:23:51,570 --> 04:23:54,960
a round to do Mass Healing Word.

6223
04:23:54,960 --> 04:23:57,563
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

6224
04:23:57,563 --> 04:24:00,410
TALIESIN: Ooh. That's nine points healing to everybody.

6225
04:24:01,550 --> 04:24:02,940
TRAVIS: Nine points healing.

6226
04:24:02,940 --> 04:24:05,320
MATT: Everyone takes six points of fire damage.

6227
04:24:05,320 --> 04:24:06,940
Go again, Jester.

6228
04:24:09,020 --> 04:24:11,020
LAURA: Great.
MATT: Okay.

6229
04:24:15,120 --> 04:24:16,390
Wow, eight points of fire damage.

6230
04:24:16,390 --> 04:24:18,807
Rolling really well on these.

6231
04:24:20,398 --> 04:24:22,572
TALIESIN: I'm doing another Mass Healing Word.
LAURA: Great.

6232
04:24:22,572 --> 04:24:23,405
MARISHA: Thank you.

6233
04:24:24,250 --> 04:24:25,540
LAURA: Wait, eight points on that one?

6234
04:24:25,540 --> 04:24:26,800
Another Healing Word?

6235
04:24:26,800 --> 04:24:28,390
TRAVIS: Hold on, not yet.
TALIESIN: And that's going to be,

6236
04:24:28,390 --> 04:24:29,980
again, that's nine points to everybody.

6237
04:24:29,980 --> 04:24:32,540
TRAVIS: Nine points of healing.

6238
04:24:32,540 --> 04:24:35,390
LIAM: We're Heroes' Feast. Do we get max healing every time?

6239
04:24:35,390 --> 04:24:36,570
MATT: No, it's not that.

6240
04:24:36,570 --> 04:24:38,060
Five points of fire damage to everybody.

6241
04:24:38,060 --> 04:24:39,130
TRAVIS: Five points of fire.

6242
04:24:39,130 --> 04:24:41,160
MARISHA: How many is that? How many more do we have to do?

6243
04:24:41,160 --> 04:24:43,290
SAM: It's dice versus dice!
MARISHA: It really is.

6244
04:24:43,290 --> 04:24:44,456
LAURA: I'm great.

6245
04:24:44,456 --> 04:24:46,114
LIAM: That's kind of D&D.

6246
04:24:47,830 --> 04:24:49,240
MATT: Four points of fire damage to everybody.

6247
04:24:49,240 --> 04:24:51,640
TRAVIS and LIAM: Okay.
LAURA: (trilling)

6248
04:24:51,640 --> 04:24:54,640
TALIESIN: I'm going to do another Healing Word.

6249
04:24:56,605 --> 04:24:58,230
Nine points of healing.

6250
04:24:58,230 --> 04:24:59,632
MARISHA: To everybody?
TALIESIN: Yep.

6251
04:24:59,632 --> 04:25:00,465
LIAM: Wow.

6252
04:25:01,967 --> 04:25:02,800
LAURA: Ooh!

6253
04:25:02,800 --> 04:25:04,358
SAM: What a rollercoaster.

6254
04:25:04,358 --> 04:25:05,710
MATT: Interesting point of order,

6255
04:25:05,710 --> 04:25:06,543
just so you're aware,

6256
04:25:06,543 --> 04:25:07,830
as you guys have a moment to think about it,

6257
04:25:07,830 --> 04:25:10,480
and think about it--
TALIESIN: (counting)

6258
04:25:10,480 --> 04:25:13,310
MATT: One, he was looking pretty hurt.

6259
04:25:13,310 --> 04:25:15,560
Like, just tipped over into hurt.

6260
04:25:15,560 --> 04:25:17,590
LIAM: Okay.

6261
04:25:17,590 --> 04:25:19,820
MATT: And if he stays, so does all that treasure.

6262
04:25:19,820 --> 04:25:21,730
LIAM: Yeah, no, no.
MATT: Just be aware.

6263
04:25:21,730 --> 04:25:23,900
TALIESIN: Yeah, I have to drop one person every round,

6264
04:25:23,900 --> 04:25:28,900
so I won't do you, so it'll be negative nine...

6265
04:25:28,910 --> 04:25:29,743
LAURA: He was looking pretty hurt?

6266
04:25:29,743 --> 04:25:31,310
MATT: He was starting to look pretty hurt, yeah.

6267
04:25:31,310 --> 04:25:32,143
TALIESIN: Negative nine.

6268
04:25:33,320 --> 04:25:34,510
MARISHA: Starting to look pretty hurt.

6269
04:25:34,510 --> 04:25:35,850
TALIESIN: Nine, nine and--

6270
04:25:35,850 --> 04:25:37,310
MATT: Three points of fire damage to everybody.

6271
04:25:37,310 --> 04:25:39,150
TALIESIN: I'll take nine too.

6272
04:25:39,150 --> 04:25:42,180
MATT: Jester, go ahead and make your concentration check.

6273
04:25:42,180 --> 04:25:44,800
SAM: Should we let him come back and just pile on? No.

6274
04:25:44,800 --> 04:25:45,770
LAURA: I mean, I guess everybody

6275
04:25:45,770 --> 04:25:47,490
could get ready to attack him,

6276
04:25:47,490 --> 04:25:48,580
and then the minute he comes in,

6277
04:25:48,580 --> 04:25:49,721
we just unload everything.

6278
04:25:49,721 --> 04:25:52,013
TRAVIS: We could do that.

6279
04:25:53,520 --> 04:25:54,880
LIAM: As they shout to each other

6280
04:25:54,880 --> 04:25:56,390
in the middle of--
SAM: Boiling water?

6281
04:25:56,390 --> 04:25:58,585
LIAM: A minute counting down.

6282
04:25:58,585 --> 04:25:59,993
LAURA: Yeah. What do you guys think?

6283
04:25:59,993 --> 04:26:03,200
MATT: You've got three more rounds to decide.

6284
04:26:03,200 --> 04:26:05,140
LAURA: We can gather around.

6285
04:26:05,140 --> 04:26:06,570
SAM: We're changing the plan mid-plan?

6286
04:26:06,570 --> 04:26:07,980
LAURA: If we're going to do it, we should do it.

6287
04:26:07,980 --> 04:26:10,250
MARISHA: For the fifth time.
SAM: (laughs)

6288
04:26:10,250 --> 04:26:11,240
LAURA: If we want the treasure.

6289
04:26:11,240 --> 04:26:13,798
MATT: Seven points of fire damage to everybody.
LAURA: It's up to you guys.

6290
04:26:14,990 --> 04:26:16,540
MARISHA: I just know it was a war of attrition.

6291
04:26:16,540 --> 04:26:18,120
Beau's about to go down.

6292
04:26:18,120 --> 04:26:19,147
ASHLEY: Yeah, I mean, if I'm low--

6293
04:26:19,147 --> 04:26:21,347
SAM: The treasure could help a lot the people

6294
04:26:21,347 --> 04:26:22,834
in the V.O. community!

6295
04:26:22,834 --> 04:26:23,667
MATT: Oh no, what'd you get?

6296
04:26:23,667 --> 04:26:25,508
LAURA: 10.
LIAM: It belongs to the people of the V.O. community.

6297
04:26:25,508 --> 04:26:27,840
MATT: 10? 10, you barely scoot by.

6298
04:26:27,840 --> 04:26:29,880
LAURA: I'd have to roll a one and a two in order to...

6299
04:26:29,880 --> 04:26:32,090
MATT: Yeah, I know. I know.
LAURA: I rolled a one and a three.

6300
04:26:32,090 --> 04:26:33,731
TALIESIN: I'm going to do a Mass Cure Wounds,

6301
04:26:33,731 --> 04:26:35,710
just because we're here.

6302
04:26:35,710 --> 04:26:36,852
It's the same thing with six, so I'm going to do--

6303
04:26:36,852 --> 04:26:40,032
LAURA: Should I drop it?
TALIESIN: One, two--

6304
04:26:41,208 --> 04:26:44,858
One, two, three, four, five.

6305
04:26:44,858 --> 04:26:46,460
Yeah, I'm going to hit everyone but you at the moment.

6306
04:26:46,460 --> 04:26:48,540
SAM: That's fine.
LAURA: Mass Cure Wounds?

6307
04:26:48,540 --> 04:26:51,530
TALIESIN: Yeah, Mass Cure Wounds. So that's...

6308
04:26:51,530 --> 04:26:53,330
Hold on.
TRAVIS: Who wants it to come back?

6309
04:26:53,330 --> 04:26:55,460
SAM: I do, but we have to get into position already.

6310
04:26:55,460 --> 04:26:58,180
LAURA: We literally have to swim around and get around

6311
04:26:58,180 --> 04:27:00,350
to where we'd be able to hit it.
LIAM: What if we make a ring?

6312
04:27:00,350 --> 04:27:01,983
LAURA: Go around him, go around him, go around him!

6313
04:27:01,983 --> 04:27:03,270
ASHLEY: Make a ring, make a ring.
LIAM: He's not here.

6314
04:27:03,270 --> 04:27:05,300
LAURA: Make a ring about where he was.

6315
04:27:05,300 --> 04:27:07,265
ASHLEY: Can you bamf him in wherever you want?

6316
04:27:07,265 --> 04:27:09,365
LAURA: No, he's going to come back where he was.

6317
04:27:09,365 --> 04:27:10,600
If we're going to do it, do it!

6318
04:27:10,600 --> 04:27:11,910
MATT: This is the last round to decide.

6319
04:27:11,910 --> 04:27:13,170
MARISHA: All right, fine, fine.

6320
04:27:13,170 --> 04:27:14,440
MATT: Or the fight's over,

6321
04:27:14,440 --> 04:27:16,810
if you manage to not roll a one and a two.

6322
04:27:16,810 --> 04:27:19,310
So your call.
LIAM: Yeah, he would stay, or...

6323
04:27:20,230 --> 04:27:22,849
It's your call.
LAURA: No, it's not.

6324
04:27:22,849 --> 04:27:25,930
LIAM: Yeah, it is.
MARISHA: One is safe and one is risky.

6325
04:27:25,930 --> 04:27:27,810
LAURA: Treasure. Treasure?

6326
04:27:27,810 --> 04:27:28,870
TRAVIS: There's so much shit on his back.

6327
04:27:28,870 --> 04:27:31,620
There's so much untold stuff.
MARISHA: Oh my god.

6328
04:27:31,620 --> 04:27:33,950
LIAM: Caleb wants that shit, but Caleb's not talking.

6329
04:27:33,950 --> 04:27:36,993
He's just acting.
TRAVIS: Just Liam. (laughs)

6330
04:27:36,993 --> 04:27:39,000
Come on!
LAURA: If we're going to do it,

6331
04:27:39,000 --> 04:27:40,560
circle around him, because I'm not going to drop it if--

6332
04:27:40,560 --> 04:27:42,230
SAM: I'm already ready!
TALIESIN: All right, I'm ready.

6333
04:27:42,230 --> 04:27:44,410
MARISHA: I can circle.
LAURA: Can we get into a place?

6334
04:27:44,410 --> 04:27:45,810
Everybody get in position around him?

6335
04:27:45,810 --> 04:27:49,060
MARISHA: Oh my god, this is the
stupidest thing we have ever done.

6336
04:27:49,060 --> 04:27:52,390
SAM: I'm going to cast Brenatto's Voltaic Bolt.

6337
04:27:52,390 --> 04:27:56,130
MARISHA: I'm going to hold my attack,
and attack as soon as I see him.

6338
04:27:56,130 --> 04:27:57,850
TALIESIN: I'm going to hit you with Holy Weapon.

6339
04:27:57,850 --> 04:27:59,130
MATT: Make a perception check, Beauregard,

6340
04:27:59,130 --> 04:28:00,930
to know where he vanished.

6341
04:28:00,930 --> 04:28:03,160
ASHLEY: Can I try to go under where he would bamf

6342
04:28:03,160 --> 04:28:04,810
so I'll be right under his belly?

6343
04:28:04,810 --> 04:28:06,250
MATT: He was on the ground at that point,

6344
04:28:06,250 --> 04:28:07,560
because he was trying to get away

6345
04:28:07,560 --> 04:28:09,510
from the astral dreadnought,

6346
04:28:09,510 --> 04:28:10,970
but you're right by where he was,

6347
04:28:10,970 --> 04:28:12,140
so he'll appear right next to you.

6348
04:28:12,140 --> 04:28:14,775
SAM: We just willingly took nine rounds of fire damage.

6349
04:28:14,775 --> 04:28:15,798
MARISHA: You're tapping me for Holy Weapon?

6350
04:28:15,798 --> 04:28:17,270
TALIESIN: Yep.
MARISHA: Okay.

6351
04:28:17,270 --> 04:28:18,103
Wait, what does that do?

6352
04:28:18,103 --> 04:28:20,520
An extra 2d8, right?
TALIESIN: It's...

6353
04:28:20,520 --> 04:28:22,940
Extra 2d8.
MATT: All right, Bless goes away.

6354
04:28:22,940 --> 04:28:24,090
TALIESIN: Yep, dropping Bless.

6355
04:28:25,030 --> 04:28:28,613
MARISHA: Oh my god, this is stupid. Why did we do this?

6356
04:28:28,613 --> 04:28:30,840
LAURA: Because he did it! He did this to us!

6357
04:28:30,840 --> 04:28:31,673
He did this!

6358
04:28:31,673 --> 04:28:34,080
TRAVIS: He appealed to our greed.
MARISHA: He totally did.

6359
04:28:34,080 --> 04:28:35,908
He got in our fucking heads.

6360
04:28:35,908 --> 04:28:38,110
SAM: (laughs)
MARISHA: He appealed to our greed.

6361
04:28:38,980 --> 04:28:41,350
MATT: Hey, hey, I'm just saying.

6362
04:28:41,350 --> 04:28:44,180
In that moment--
LAURA: Everybody get ready,

6363
04:28:44,180 --> 04:28:45,180
and then I'm going to drop it,

6364
04:28:45,180 --> 04:28:46,218
and everybody cast something, right?

6365
04:28:46,218 --> 04:28:50,220
MATT: All right, so who's moving from where they are?

6366
04:28:50,220 --> 04:28:51,990
LAURA: I'm going to try to be within 60 feet

6367
04:28:51,990 --> 04:28:53,281
of where he went away.
LIAM: We're within order.

6368
04:28:53,281 --> 04:28:55,430
We're not going to get to all attack him all together.

6369
04:28:55,430 --> 04:28:56,263
LAURA: No, we do.

6370
04:28:56,263 --> 04:28:57,970
MATT: If you all hold an action right as she releases it,

6371
04:28:57,970 --> 04:28:59,150
you would all be able to.

6372
04:28:59,150 --> 04:29:01,680
Everyone gets in.
TRAVIS: Like Ripley.

6373
04:29:01,680 --> 04:29:02,513
LIAM: All right.

6374
04:29:02,513 --> 04:29:03,590
MATT: You would have the opportunity to do that.

6375
04:29:03,590 --> 04:29:06,410
LIAM: Disintegrate, if that's what we're doing.

6376
04:29:06,410 --> 04:29:07,460
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: Okay. All right.

6377
04:29:07,460 --> 04:29:08,810
TRAVIS: Call it.
LAURA: Yes.

6378
04:29:08,810 --> 04:29:10,793
MATT: Vilya's going to come over here.

6379
04:29:11,918 --> 04:29:14,560
LAURA: He could deflect all of these at once.

6380
04:29:14,560 --> 04:29:16,550
LIAM: Disintegrate could go to you.

6381
04:29:16,550 --> 04:29:18,250
LAURA: But it's all happening at once, so...

6382
04:29:18,250 --> 04:29:20,260
TALIESIN: I'm going to be 30 feet away, give or take.

6383
04:29:20,260 --> 04:29:22,070
MATT: 30 feet away from him would be about...

6384
04:29:22,070 --> 04:29:23,890
TALIESIN: Yeah, a little out of the group.

6385
04:29:23,890 --> 04:29:26,078
A little off from the group.
SAM: Is Yasha able to join us?

6386
04:29:26,078 --> 04:29:27,144
MATT: A little off from the group?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

6387
04:29:27,144 --> 04:29:28,844
ASHLEY: Does it matter at this point?

6388
04:29:28,844 --> 04:29:30,072
SAM: (laughs)
TRAVIS: Aw!

6389
04:29:30,072 --> 04:29:32,069
ASHLEY: I'm going to roll a one.

6390
04:29:32,069 --> 04:29:34,504
LAURA: You're going to get a
natural 20 on this one, I can feel it.

6391
04:29:34,504 --> 04:29:36,010
ASHLEY: Let's do it.

6392
04:29:36,854 --> 04:29:38,950
MARISHA: I'm going to laugh when you
get the How Do You Want to Do This.

6393
04:29:38,950 --> 04:29:41,260
ASHLEY: There's no-- we're all going at the same time.

6394
04:29:41,260 --> 04:29:44,343
LIAM: Even if you don't, we all eat shit.

6395
04:29:44,343 --> 04:29:46,580
LAURA: All right. Everybody's prepped?

6396
04:29:46,580 --> 04:29:47,830
ASHLEY: Yes.

6397
04:29:47,830 --> 04:29:50,298
LAURA: Drop it, and everybody hits at the same time.

6398
04:29:50,298 --> 04:29:54,544
MATT: Okay. So as you all prepare yourselves at the ready,

6399
04:29:54,544 --> 04:29:56,070
in a very ballsy maneuver,

6400
04:29:56,070 --> 04:30:00,068
Jester, at the last minute, releases Banishment.

6401
04:30:00,068 --> 04:30:00,901
(magic pulsing)

6402
04:30:00,901 --> 04:30:03,960
You watch as Vokodo immediately appears

6403
04:30:03,960 --> 04:30:05,640
in the space where he vanished,

6404
04:30:05,640 --> 04:30:10,640
with a look of absolute sheer fear and panic in his eyes.

6405
04:30:10,710 --> 04:30:14,440
There is a screech you've never heard a creature make.

6406
04:30:14,440 --> 04:30:17,540
He's been so guttural and frightening this entire time.

6407
04:30:17,540 --> 04:30:18,970
Put Caduceus back on here.

6408
04:30:18,970 --> 04:30:20,720
But the sound he makes when he arrives

6409
04:30:20,720 --> 04:30:24,520
is this mournful, "No!"

6410
04:30:26,306 --> 04:30:27,340
If this creature could shit its pants,

6411
04:30:27,340 --> 04:30:29,364
it'd be shitting its pants right now.

6412
04:30:29,364 --> 04:30:32,820
There is an absolute sense of desperate fear

6413
04:30:32,820 --> 04:30:35,040
that's he's trying to swim away

6414
04:30:35,040 --> 04:30:36,280
and is in the process of doing so

6415
04:30:36,280 --> 04:30:37,113
as he arrives.

6416
04:30:37,113 --> 04:30:38,150
All right, held actions.

6417
04:30:38,150 --> 04:30:39,440
We'll go across the table here.

6418
04:30:39,440 --> 04:30:40,400
Fjord, what are you doing?

6419
04:30:40,400 --> 04:30:41,750
TRAVIS: I'm using the Relentless Hex

6420
04:30:41,750 --> 04:30:44,570
to bamf in to five feet with him,

6421
04:30:44,570 --> 04:30:47,550
and I'm going to hit him twice with the Star Razor.

6422
04:30:47,550 --> 04:30:48,933
MATT: Go for it.

6423
04:30:51,059 --> 04:30:52,390
TRAVIS: 16 plus...

6424
04:30:52,390 --> 04:30:55,530
That's a million. That's 29 to hit.

6425
04:30:55,530 --> 04:30:57,289
MATT: That hits.

6426
04:30:57,289 --> 04:31:02,289
TRAVIS: I'm going to dump a
5th-level Divine Smite into this.

6427
04:31:03,272 --> 04:31:06,449
So that's eight, seven, that's 15 plus...

6428
04:31:06,449 --> 04:31:11,449
MARISHA: I can't believe we--
TRAVIS: 19 plus a d4.

6429
04:31:11,700 --> 04:31:13,370
MATT: It's really fascinating.
LIAM: Yeah.

6430
04:31:13,370 --> 04:31:15,020
MARISHA: We took damage for nine rounds.

6431
04:31:15,020 --> 04:31:19,756
LIAM: I used D&D Beyond to roll.
ASHLEY: To bring it back. (laughs)

6432
04:31:19,756 --> 04:31:20,890
SAM: Oh, interesting.
LIAM: Yeah.

6433
04:31:20,890 --> 04:31:25,543
TRAVIS: 22 plus 5d8, okay. Here we go.

6434
04:31:25,543 --> 04:31:29,903
(counting)

6435
04:31:29,903 --> 04:31:32,106
LIAM: I've always wanted to kill Marisha's character.

6436
04:31:32,106 --> 04:31:34,505
(laughter)

6437
04:31:34,505 --> 04:31:38,332
MARISHA: No, no, no! (disintegrating)

6438
04:31:38,332 --> 04:31:40,578
LIAM: It was a hidden desire from campaign one,

6439
04:31:40,578 --> 04:31:42,930
and now it can come to fruition.

6440
04:31:42,930 --> 04:31:45,930
MARISHA: Keep your fetishes to yourself.
TRAVIS: That's 49 points of damage.

6441
04:31:45,930 --> 04:31:48,752
LIAM: Artagan. That's Artagan's fetish.
MARISHA: Yeah, that's true.

6442
04:31:48,752 --> 04:31:50,070
MATT: (exclaiming)

6443
04:31:50,070 --> 04:31:51,450
LIAM: Wait, how much was it?
TRAVIS: 49.

6444
04:31:51,450 --> 04:31:53,130
MATT: 49 points of damage.

6445
04:31:53,130 --> 04:31:54,380
You take four points of fire damage

6446
04:31:54,380 --> 04:31:56,610
as the fire blasts back against you.

6447
04:31:56,610 --> 04:32:00,020
TRAVIS: Awesome. Second one is a 22 to hit.

6448
04:32:00,020 --> 04:32:00,960
MATT: That hits.
ASHLEY: 22 points.

6449
04:32:00,960 --> 04:32:04,548
LIAM: Goddamn, that was the first hit?! Paladin.

6450
04:32:04,548 --> 04:32:08,092
Multiclass. C'mon now.

6451
04:32:08,092 --> 04:32:09,370
MATT: Morkoth is nasty, man.

6452
04:32:09,370 --> 04:32:14,370
TRAVIS: Five, seven is 12, plus a 14--
LAURA: Kill him. Kill him.

6453
04:32:14,750 --> 04:32:18,250
Kill him.
TRAVIS: Is 17 points of

6454
04:32:18,250 --> 04:32:20,630
fucking crazy-ass rune sword damage.

6455
04:32:20,630 --> 04:32:21,676
MATT: Hell yeah. So

6456
04:32:21,676 --> 04:32:23,580
(clashing) striking back,

6457
04:32:23,580 --> 04:32:25,220
you can see you've carved this large chunk

6458
04:32:25,220 --> 04:32:26,053
off the side of the body

6459
04:32:26,053 --> 04:32:28,160
that shifts out, almost like a cake slice,

6460
04:32:28,160 --> 04:32:31,690
and as it does, it exposes this raw interior magma.

6461
04:32:31,690 --> 04:32:35,163
It screams, the pain is still there.

6462
04:32:35,163 --> 04:32:36,780
It's so much damage, but it's still

6463
04:32:36,780 --> 04:32:39,710
eyes are wild, and it's not even noticing your presence,

6464
04:32:39,710 --> 04:32:40,543
it's so scared.

6465
04:32:40,543 --> 04:32:41,757
TRAVIS: And I probably take fire damage on that second hit.

6466
04:32:41,757 --> 04:32:43,660
MATT: You do. You take one point of fire damage.

6467
04:32:43,660 --> 04:32:44,720
TRAVIS: Awesome.

6468
04:32:44,720 --> 04:32:49,052
MATT: All righty. So Fjord was there.
I'm going to go back to the--

6469
04:32:49,052 --> 04:32:50,130
We're just going to do this in initiative order as we go.

6470
04:32:50,130 --> 04:32:53,160
Beau, you're up.
MARISHA: Oh, oh. Oh, jeez.

6471
04:32:53,160 --> 04:32:55,600
Okay. Pop pop.

6472
04:32:55,600 --> 04:32:57,090
MATT: I figured as opposed to going around the table,

6473
04:32:57,090 --> 04:32:59,150
I would just go ahead and go down initiative order.

6474
04:33:00,160 --> 04:33:04,894
MARISHA: That is 30 total-- sorry, 31 total to hit.

6475
04:33:04,894 --> 04:33:06,569
MATT: That hits.
LIAM: (Irish accent) 30 damage.

6476
04:33:06,569 --> 04:33:10,674
ALL: (in Irish accents) 30 damage.

6477
04:33:11,943 --> 04:33:15,014
LIAM: It's me, Beauregard O'Lionett.

6478
04:33:15,014 --> 04:33:17,470
MARISHA: 2d8 holy, right?

6479
04:33:17,470 --> 04:33:20,050
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.
MARISHA: So I'm rolling 3d8 for this.

6480
04:33:20,050 --> 04:33:25,050
Do I get-- Okay, okay, okay. Sorry.

6481
04:33:25,050 --> 04:33:28,030
Okay. (exhales)

6482
04:33:29,510 --> 04:33:32,985
17 plus five is 22 damage.

6483
04:33:32,985 --> 04:33:36,676
17 plus five is 22 damage.

6484
04:33:36,676 --> 04:33:38,410
MATT: 22 points of damage, nice.

6485
04:33:38,410 --> 04:33:42,120
MARISHA: With some of that being holy.

6486
04:33:42,120 --> 04:33:44,560
MATT: It's not really anything to add,

6487
04:33:44,560 --> 04:33:47,471
so it just goes--
SAM and MARISHA: (mumbles) I don't know.

6488
04:33:47,471 --> 04:33:51,508
MARISHA: And okay.

6489
04:33:51,508 --> 04:33:53,770
27 to hit.
MATT: That hits.

6490
04:33:53,770 --> 04:33:55,206
You can roll damage for the next one.

6491
04:33:55,206 --> 04:33:57,257
MARISHA: (babbling)

6492
04:33:57,257 --> 04:33:59,344
So nervous!
LAURA: We're all so nervous!

6493
04:33:59,344 --> 04:34:03,051
MARISHA: Ah, okay.

6494
04:34:03,051 --> 04:34:07,000
10, 15, 16, 17...

6495
04:34:07,000 --> 04:34:08,504
Another 22 damage.
SAM: Jeez, Louise.

6496
04:34:08,504 --> 04:34:10,290
MATT and ASHLEY: Nice.

6497
04:34:10,290 --> 04:34:11,982
MATT: Can't believe you Counterspelled his Chain Lightning.

6498
04:34:11,982 --> 04:34:14,000
I'm so angry.
SAM: Ooh, Chain Lightning!

6499
04:34:14,000 --> 04:34:15,304
TALIESIN: Fuck!
MATT: Nasty.

6500
04:34:15,304 --> 04:34:17,437
LAURA: Oh my god.

6501
04:34:17,437 --> 04:34:18,950
TRAVIS: and ASHLEY: (lightning crackling)

6502
04:34:18,950 --> 04:34:23,320
MATT: 8d10 lightning damage to four targets.
MARISHA: And I can only do my held action, right?

6503
04:34:23,320 --> 04:34:24,660
MATT: That was your held action, so that's all you get.

6504
04:34:24,660 --> 04:34:26,150
MARISHA: That's what I get.
TRAVIS: ♪ You're welcome. ♪

6505
04:34:26,150 --> 04:34:30,350
MATT: All right. Now that brings us to Caleb.

6506
04:34:30,350 --> 04:34:32,690
LIAM: Yeah, Disintegrate. Dexterity save.

6507
04:34:32,690 --> 04:34:34,610
I already rolled it using D&D Beyond,

6508
04:34:34,610 --> 04:34:39,090
and it's a 72, unless you make your dex save.

6509
04:34:39,090 --> 04:34:40,440
MATT: (exhaling)

6510
04:34:40,440 --> 04:34:41,714
LIAM: (magic pulsing)

6511
04:34:41,714 --> 04:34:42,672
MATT: Does anybody in this party

6512
04:34:42,672 --> 04:34:44,877
have over 72 hit points at the moment?

6513
04:34:44,877 --> 04:34:46,880
SAM: (gasping)
LIAM: Pass.

6514
04:34:46,880 --> 04:34:48,520
TRAVIS: Yes.
SAM: You don't know.

6515
04:34:48,520 --> 04:34:49,777
MATT: It's true, I don't know.
TALIESIN: No, you don't.

6516
04:34:49,777 --> 04:34:52,990
LIAM: (laughs)
TALIESIN: You know for some of us.

6517
04:34:52,990 --> 04:34:55,570
MATT: If this goes wrong, I already have my target.

6518
04:34:55,570 --> 04:34:57,420
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: Dexterity, you said, right?

6519
04:34:57,420 --> 04:34:59,270
LIAM: Make it Jester.

6520
04:35:02,029 --> 04:35:04,490
TRAVIS: Come on, say it.
SAM: Natural 20.

6521
04:35:04,490 --> 04:35:06,840
MATT: I can't have anybody come over here to look at this.

6522
04:35:06,840 --> 04:35:07,920
TRAVIS: I can, I can--
LIAM: You got a 20?

6523
04:35:07,920 --> 04:35:09,200
LAURA: Oh, no, no, no!

6524
04:35:10,630 --> 04:35:12,296
MATT: I'll step away.
LIAM: Just tell us, we'll believe it!

6525
04:35:12,296 --> 04:35:13,500
TRAVIS: Is it that clear one?

6526
04:35:13,500 --> 04:35:16,200
MATT: No, it's the golden purple--
LAURA: Is it a 20 or is it a one?

6527
04:35:16,200 --> 04:35:19,110
TRAVIS: I see it.
LIAM: 20?

6528
04:35:19,110 --> 04:35:21,240
MARISHA: What is it? Is it bad?
LIAM: It's a 20.

6529
04:35:21,240 --> 04:35:22,990
It's going to go to who he wants it to.

6530
04:35:22,990 --> 04:35:24,510
MATT: So, Caleb.
LIAM: Yeah.

6531
04:35:24,510 --> 04:35:26,380
MATT: As you are preparing the spell,

6532
04:35:26,380 --> 04:35:28,530
and you bring it back, you feel the arcane energy

6533
04:35:28,530 --> 04:35:29,730
crackling in your fingers.
LIAM: Right.

6534
04:35:29,730 --> 04:35:32,840
I break open a bag of dust, underwater--

6535
04:35:32,840 --> 04:35:35,765
MATT: Which floats for a second.
LIAM: -- press the lodestone through.

6536
04:35:35,765 --> 04:35:38,480
I'm going to kill Vokodo, obviously.

6537
04:35:38,480 --> 04:35:39,687
(magic pulsing)

6538
04:35:39,687 --> 04:35:41,060
MATT: And as you release the green ray,

6539
04:35:41,060 --> 04:35:44,900
you watch as Vokodo, eyes wild, there's this shimmer

6540
04:35:44,900 --> 04:35:47,810
as the kinetic, psychic energy around it

6541
04:35:47,810 --> 04:35:50,470
that seems to be deflecting the spells

6542
04:35:50,470 --> 04:35:53,570
pushes against and resists the spell

6543
04:35:53,570 --> 04:35:55,140
and then fails.

6544
04:35:55,140 --> 04:35:56,317
How do you want to do this?

6545
04:35:56,317 --> 04:35:57,395
(exclaiming)

6546
04:35:57,395 --> 04:35:58,778
LIAM: You're fucked with my head!

6547
04:35:58,778 --> 04:35:59,861
MATT: Rolled a natural one.

6548
04:35:59,861 --> 04:36:01,807
TRAVIS: (laughs)
MATT: Fucking natural one.

6549
04:36:01,807 --> 04:36:03,440
LIAM: Rolled a-- what did you say?
MATT: A natural one.

6550
04:36:03,440 --> 04:36:05,422
LIAM: Whoa, a one, not a 20!

6551
04:36:05,422 --> 04:36:07,135
TRAVIS: I didn't want to say anything.

6552
04:36:07,135 --> 04:36:09,200
LAURA: I really, really thought it
was going to kill one of us!

6553
04:36:09,200 --> 04:36:11,340
LIAM: The light that has been gleaming out of its mouth

6554
04:36:11,340 --> 04:36:12,770
all this time,

6555
04:36:12,770 --> 04:36:17,040
the beam of dark green energy leaves the palm of my hand

6556
04:36:17,040 --> 04:36:18,750
like Spider-Man (web shooting)

6557
04:36:18,750 --> 04:36:20,900
and goes straight through that light,

6558
04:36:20,900 --> 04:36:23,420
pierces through, right through,

6559
04:36:23,420 --> 04:36:26,840
and to stay thematically with our episode,

6560
04:36:26,840 --> 04:36:29,424
goes in the mouth and out the butthole.

6561
04:36:29,424 --> 04:36:31,530
(laughter)
Straight through in a line.

6562
04:36:31,530 --> 04:36:32,363
MATT: All right.

6563
04:36:32,363 --> 04:36:33,764
LIAM: Thank you for whoever laughed.

6564
04:36:33,764 --> 04:36:36,470
(laughter)

6565
04:36:36,470 --> 04:36:39,730
TALIESIN: From the ether.

6566
04:36:42,150 --> 04:36:42,983
TALIESIN: Fuck.
LAURA: That's not going to

6567
04:36:42,983 --> 04:36:44,886
disintegrate all of his treasure, right?

6568
04:36:44,886 --> 04:36:46,770
SAM: Yes, it will.
LIAM: No, no, it's magic.

6569
04:36:46,770 --> 04:36:49,070
Magic stuff does not disintegrate.

6570
04:36:50,064 --> 04:36:50,897
(paper rustling)

6571
04:36:50,897 --> 04:36:52,200
TALIESIN: That would've been a lot.
LAURA: Is he looking

6572
04:36:52,200 --> 04:36:53,562
to see if it disintegrates everything on him?

6573
04:36:53,562 --> 04:36:55,569
SAM: No, he's looking to see what the--

6574
04:36:55,569 --> 04:37:00,319
LIAM: The Deck of Many Things cards scatter in the water.
SAM: -- erupting volcano has already killed.

6575
04:37:01,310 --> 04:37:04,870
MATT: As the green ray fires through Vokodo's form,

6576
04:37:04,870 --> 04:37:09,750
the wild panic somehow grows more desperate.

6577
04:37:09,750 --> 04:37:11,100
At first it looks like it missed,

6578
04:37:11,100 --> 04:37:13,440
or it did no serious damage.

6579
04:37:13,440 --> 04:37:16,190
But you watch from the pinpoint hole

6580
04:37:16,190 --> 04:37:18,250
that has been carved through the body,

6581
04:37:18,250 --> 04:37:21,450
its interior begins to just disassociate

6582
04:37:21,450 --> 04:37:24,300
into sludge around the outside of it.

6583
04:37:24,300 --> 04:37:26,573
It's being cored from the center out.

6584
04:37:26,573 --> 04:37:29,440
And as it's screaming,

6585
04:37:29,440 --> 04:37:32,787
this wave of violent, psychic energy

6586
04:37:32,787 --> 04:37:33,620
(energy blasting)

6587
04:37:33,620 --> 04:37:35,080
bursts out through all of you.

6588
04:37:35,080 --> 04:37:37,800
Your vision is suddenly not yours,

6589
04:37:37,800 --> 04:37:40,290
as the psychic energy released

6590
04:37:40,290 --> 04:37:42,360
pierces into your brain,

6591
04:37:42,360 --> 04:37:46,180
and your mind is clouded with a flash of vision

6592
04:37:46,180 --> 04:37:48,650
after vision after vision after vision after vision.

6593
04:37:50,000 --> 04:37:52,260
The scream that hurts, your ears are bleeding,

6594
04:37:52,260 --> 04:37:54,530
your eyes are bleeding and clouding in the water,

6595
04:37:54,530 --> 04:37:55,430
but you don't even notice,

6596
04:37:55,430 --> 04:38:00,430
because you're just seeing in your mind's eye

6597
04:38:00,530 --> 04:38:05,530
a gossamer sky of purples and blacks and greens and blues,

6598
04:38:05,880 --> 04:38:07,600
the Astral Sea itself,

6599
04:38:07,600 --> 04:38:11,170
clouded with distant shattering pieces.

6600
04:38:11,170 --> 04:38:14,120
An endless sea of stars and possibility.

6601
04:38:14,120 --> 04:38:17,470
Flashes of something in shadow, large, ominous,

6602
04:38:17,470 --> 04:38:19,245
monolithic.

6603
04:38:20,450 --> 04:38:22,042
A city.

6604
04:38:22,042 --> 04:38:27,041
A city that is moving under its own power.

6605
04:38:28,120 --> 04:38:32,720
Hunting. Moving with will.

6606
04:38:32,720 --> 04:38:35,990
Following. You feel the fear of Vokodo.

6607
04:38:35,990 --> 04:38:38,790
You feel it trying to escape.

6608
04:38:38,790 --> 04:38:43,790
You feel this city hungry and chasing.

6609
04:38:44,370 --> 04:38:46,750
You flash into the streets of the city.

6610
04:38:46,750 --> 04:38:48,940
You see paved roads.

6611
04:38:48,940 --> 04:38:51,360
You see buildings and towers.

6612
04:38:51,360 --> 04:38:54,790
And they flick and bend, organically,

6613
04:38:54,790 --> 04:38:57,720
shift like they're alive.

6614
04:38:57,720 --> 04:38:59,625
Roads pulse.

6615
04:39:00,940 --> 04:39:04,542
This is weirdly familiar, but so alien.

6616
04:39:06,550 --> 04:39:11,240
Thousands of minds within are the city.

6617
04:39:11,240 --> 04:39:16,240
It doesn't make sense. Hungry, seeking.

6618
04:39:16,980 --> 04:39:18,570
There's another flash.

6619
04:39:18,570 --> 04:39:21,980
Within the minds of Eyes of Nine,

6620
04:39:21,980 --> 04:39:25,450
flash back, the vessel, the city draws close.

6621
04:39:25,450 --> 04:39:30,120
Fear. Flee. Break through.

6622
04:39:30,120 --> 04:39:33,190
Break and drag. Obfuscate.

6623
04:39:33,190 --> 04:39:36,340
With its last power, you feel Vokodo attempt to flee

6624
04:39:36,340 --> 04:39:37,880
and break through the barriers,

6625
04:39:37,880 --> 04:39:38,960
dragging with it the pieces

6626
04:39:38,960 --> 04:39:41,880
to flee from whatever this thing,

6627
04:39:41,880 --> 04:39:46,880
this entity, this form, was.

6628
04:39:47,150 --> 04:39:49,420
And right as those memories flash,

6629
04:39:49,420 --> 04:39:51,650
the screaming subsides,

6630
04:39:51,650 --> 04:39:54,530
and your vision begins to come back to

6631
04:39:54,530 --> 04:39:55,940
as the rest of the body of Vokodo

6632
04:39:55,940 --> 04:39:58,470
just drifts into floating sludge

6633
04:39:58,470 --> 04:40:00,770
and waterlogged ash.

6634
04:40:00,770 --> 04:40:05,770
The rest of the remnants of its gold, treasure,

6635
04:40:06,240 --> 04:40:09,398
falling and clattering to the floor of the chamber.

6636
04:40:11,123 --> 04:40:12,700
For a moment, you all look around and now notice

6637
04:40:12,700 --> 04:40:17,698
the blood that now sits floating from every facial orifice,

6638
04:40:19,830 --> 04:40:20,960
and the look in each other's eyes,

6639
04:40:20,960 --> 04:40:23,340
you get the sense that you all just experienced the same,

6640
04:40:23,340 --> 04:40:25,290
or something very similar.

6641
04:40:26,950 --> 04:40:28,561
And that's where we're going to end tonight's episode.

6642
04:40:28,561 --> 04:40:30,711
(groaning)
SAM: What the fuck was that?

6643
04:40:31,990 --> 04:40:35,596
TRAVIS: Hey, great call bringing him back.
LAURA: We didn't even freaking die!

6644
04:40:35,596 --> 04:40:37,774
TRAVIS: Great call bringing him back!

6645
04:40:37,774 --> 04:40:40,750
SAM: We did everything right.

6646
04:40:40,750 --> 04:40:43,970
We did it all perfectly!
TRAVIS: Just like we planned it.

6647
04:40:43,970 --> 04:40:46,015
SAM: Oh, guys.
TALIESIN: A well-oiled copy of Mousetrap.

6648
04:40:46,015 --> 04:40:48,650
LIAM: (like Stefon from SNL) This battle had everything.

6649
04:40:48,650 --> 04:40:50,950
It had boiling water.

6650
04:40:50,950 --> 04:40:53,140
It had ricocheting spells.
TRAVIS: What the fuck?

6651
04:40:53,140 --> 04:40:54,770
Did the city...

6652
04:40:54,770 --> 04:40:56,020
LAURA: Oh, I want to know about that city.

6653
04:40:56,020 --> 04:40:57,730
TALIESIN: Is it anything I saw in my vision, or no?

6654
04:40:57,730 --> 04:41:01,351
MATT: No.
TRAVIS: Was it like the Chained Oblivion?

6655
04:41:01,351 --> 04:41:02,184
SAM: Wow.

6656
04:41:02,184 --> 04:41:04,550
MATT: It was weird. It was very weird.

6657
04:41:04,550 --> 04:41:06,040
Very alien, very nightmare-like.

6658
04:41:06,040 --> 04:41:09,087
TRAVIS: Moving. Not static, moving.
MATT: Static and then moving.

6659
04:41:09,087 --> 04:41:09,920
And static.

6660
04:41:09,920 --> 04:41:11,660
LAURA: Like the Ring girl?
MATT: Kind of.

6661
04:41:11,660 --> 04:41:12,493
TRAVIS: Shut--!

6662
04:41:12,493 --> 04:41:15,350
No, there's no association that he gave to that!

6663
04:41:15,350 --> 04:41:16,750
MATT: It would seem rigid,

6664
04:41:16,750 --> 04:41:21,140
and then it would tense, like muscles,

6665
04:41:21,140 --> 04:41:25,380
and then become suddenly curved and organic,

6666
04:41:25,380 --> 04:41:26,260
and then shift back.

6667
04:41:26,260 --> 04:41:27,200
LAURA: We know the city.

6668
04:41:27,200 --> 04:41:30,100
TALIESIN: It's going to be totally
driving you mad, isn't it?

6669
04:41:30,100 --> 04:41:31,740
TALIESIN: Right now, chat is freaking the fuck out.

6670
04:41:31,740 --> 04:41:34,890
MATT: So, sorry for the long episode,

6671
04:41:34,890 --> 04:41:37,030
but we've been building up to this boss fight.

6672
04:41:37,030 --> 04:41:38,580
We'll come back here next week

6673
04:41:38,580 --> 04:41:40,750
and pick up from where we left off,

6674
04:41:40,750 --> 04:41:45,750
this vision in the center of a boiling volcano interior.

6675
04:41:45,890 --> 04:41:46,723
LAURA: Oh god, that's right.

6676
04:41:46,723 --> 04:41:48,005
The volcano's--
TRAVIS: It's erupting.

6677
04:41:48,005 --> 04:41:51,050
MATT: And hopefully--
LIAM: We don't have seven hours to pick through

6678
04:41:51,050 --> 04:41:51,883
this treasure.
MATT: Yeah.

6679
04:41:51,883 --> 04:41:52,820
Well, here's the thing.

6680
04:41:52,820 --> 04:41:54,270
The fight's over. Water's still hot.

6681
04:41:54,270 --> 04:41:55,700
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: So we're going to pick up there

6682
04:41:55,700 --> 04:41:56,877
next week.

6683
04:41:56,877 --> 04:42:00,630
But thank you all so much for joining us.
