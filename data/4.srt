00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,928
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:03,928 --> 00:00:07,459
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

3
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:13,003
(cheering)

4
00:00:13,003 --> 00:00:17,209
MATT: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Before we
jump in to tonight's episode, we're going to go ahead

5
00:00:17,209 --> 00:00:20,685
and do some quick announcements. First and
foremost, our returning sponsor and long-time

6
00:00:20,685 --> 00:00:29,284
partner for this campaign's beginning, on into the
foreseeable future, hopefully: D&amp;D Beyond. They've

7
00:00:29,284 --> 00:00:31,535
been awesome. Sam, do you have a few words you
want to say?

8
00:00:31,535 --> 00:00:38,740
SAM: Guys, hi! Sam Riegel, here. It's award
season, so tonight I'm going to announce the D&amp;D

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,293
Beyond Awards. The envelope, please!

10
00:00:41,293 --> 00:00:43,207
TRAVIS: Paper cut.

11
00:00:43,207 --> 00:00:51,480
SAM: Okay, nervous, really nervous. There's
nothing in here. Best discount codes for books in

12
00:00:51,480 --> 00:01:02,626
the D&amp;D Beyond store? The winner is: beginnings.
"Beginnings" is the discount code! Best URL on the

13
00:01:02,626 --> 00:01:12,821
entire internet? The winner is: DNDBeyond.com!
Best picture--

14
00:01:12,821 --> 00:01:15,705
LAURA: This is so stupid.

15
00:01:15,705 --> 00:01:18,789
SAM: La La Land. It's Moonlight.

16
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:21,832
(cheering)

17
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:23,877
MARISHA: Old jokes.

18
00:01:23,877 --> 00:01:37,699
SAM: Best way to build a Blood Hunter? Activate
Critical Role content on DNDBeyond.com! Best

19
00:01:37,699 --> 00:01:47,850
supporting actor? Sam Riegel. Best job opening at
a D&amp;D-related internet company? Front-End

20
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:54,331
Developer. I guess they're looking for a front-end
developer. Someone will put a URL somewhere on here.

21
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:59,643
MATT: At careers.com is where you can go to the
Careers tab.

22
00:01:59,643 --> 00:02:05,655
SAM: Thank you, D&amp;D Beyond, for being our
official-- What are they calling it?

23
00:02:05,655 --> 00:02:07,495
LAURA: Sponsor?

24
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:13,495
SAM: No, not sponsor. They're the official tool
set of Critical Role.

25
00:02:13,495 --> 00:02:15,848
LAURA: Oh, that's cool.

26
00:02:15,848 --> 00:02:18,742
TRAVIS: Well done! Is that the first annual--

27
00:02:18,742 --> 00:02:30,941
SAM: The first annual awards show. What should we
call them? Not the Oscars. The Critters. No. The Sponsees.

28
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:35,484
LAURA: Ooh, The Sponsees. That's fancy.

29
00:02:35,484 --> 00:02:38,129
LIAM: That was strangely manic and desperate.

30
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:45,927
MARISHA: Isn't every awards show, though?

31
00:02:45,927 --> 00:02:48,749
LIAM: Did you literally write that in the bathroom
six minutes ago?

32
00:02:48,749 --> 00:02:50,946
SAM: For sure.

33
00:02:50,946 --> 00:02:55,914
MATT: I feel like Kendrick Lamar should've won
at least two of those, but...

34
00:02:55,914 --> 00:03:00,363
Thank you, Sam. Thank you, D&amp;D Beyond. You
can find them on DNDbeyond.com. That's

35
00:03:00,363 --> 00:03:10,044
DNDbeyond.com. Next up, based on tonight's
episode, we'll have next Tuesday, at 7:00PM

36
00:03:10,044 --> 00:03:15,382
Pacific Time, here on Twitch and Alpha, Talks
Machina, where members of the cast will come, with

37
00:03:15,382 --> 00:03:19,518
our fantastic Brian W. Foster, to discuss what
transpires tonight. You get to ask questions and

38
00:03:19,518 --> 00:03:28,547
submit them, so do so. Asinine Wisdom, next week
on Geek &amp; Sundry Twitch, has a special guest. I

39
00:03:28,547 --> 00:03:31,068
believe our very own Sam Riegel will be there.

40
00:03:31,068 --> 00:03:32,573
SAM: Oh, god.

41
00:03:32,573 --> 00:03:33,979
LAURA: You're actually doing something else on the
internet?

42
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:42,327
SAM: I always do shows on Geek &amp; Sundry, and this
is no change. What's the show called again?

43
00:03:42,327 --> 00:03:51,352
MATT: Asinine Wisdom. It's at 9:00PM on Tuesday,
Pacific Time, after Talks Machina. A double-dose

44
00:03:51,352 --> 00:04:04,645
of Sam Riegel, which is a lot. We have a new show
coming up here, featuring the Weave RPG, from The

45
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:09,420
Monocle Society, called Weave. That'll be showing
next Wednesday night at 9:30 Pacific Standard

46
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,561
Time, here on the Twitch Channel. Check it out
then. It has a great cast of Amy Dallen, Gina

47
00:04:13,561 --> 00:04:18,068
DeVivo, Whitney Moore, Becca Scott, and Stef
Woodward, so check it out! I hope you like it.

48
00:04:18,068 --> 00:04:24,174
Weave is really awesome. I'm really excited to see
that. The podcast of episode three last week

49
00:04:24,174 --> 00:04:28,738
released today, so if you missed the last episode,
or have friends who have been trying to keep up with the

50
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:34,720
podcast, last week's episode is available for
download. Once again, we have issue number four of

51
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,008
Critical Role: Vox Machina Origins. It's
available for download digitally, on Comixology,

52
00:04:40,008 --> 00:04:43,008
the Dark Horse app, and all other places where
fine digital comic books are sold.

53
00:04:43,008 --> 00:04:46,106
TRAVIS: Go get it, rate it, love it. Show us that
you're reading it.

54
00:04:46,106 --> 00:04:49,372
LIAM: Burn it. Not the book, Laura's die.

55
00:04:49,515 --> 00:04:51,351
SAM: I've got to help her choose her dice.

56
00:04:51,351 --> 00:04:52,977
MATT: No! Why would you do that? You know better!

57
00:04:52,977 --> 00:04:55,273
SAM: I've already cursed two of them.

58
00:04:55,273 --> 00:05:02,239
LAURA: They're out. All the ones that got selected
tonight are shades of pinks, purples and blues and

59
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:03,521
I think it's lovely.

60
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:06,435
MATT: It's like watching a video of guys putting
their hands in alligator mouths. Like, why would

61
00:05:06,435 --> 00:05:16,879
you do that? It's entertaining for us, but why
would you do that? Once again, our fantastic

62
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:22,949
charity, 826LA. If you get the opportunity to
either give and help out or donate your time to

63
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:28,411
help teach any of their fantastic classes to help
children learn creative writing in environments

64
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:32,706
where it's hard to find that type of tutelage.
It's a great program. Check it out at your local

65
00:05:32,706 --> 00:05:34,471
826 chapter and see if you can help out.

66
00:05:34,471 --> 00:05:37,529
MARISHA: Tell them you want to run a D&amp;D game for
them.

67
00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:41,868
MATT: I think that's it.

68
00:05:41,868 --> 00:05:43,146
LAURA: That was so fast, though!

69
00:05:43,146 --> 00:05:44,187
MATT: I know.

70
00:05:44,187 --> 00:05:49,313
SAM: The comic book is out.

71
00:05:49,313 --> 00:05:53,405
LAURA: What about our appearances coming up?

72
00:05:53,405 --> 00:06:01,045
LIAM: I'm going to be at BAK-Anime this weekend.
Two days only in Bakersfield, California. I will

73
00:06:01,045 --> 00:06:03,245
talk and I will go out in public.

74
00:06:03,245 --> 00:06:07,660
LAURA: Me and Travis--

75
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,134
TRAVIS: Travis and I--

76
00:06:09,134 --> 00:06:18,669
LAURA: Travis and I are going to be at Emerald
City Comic Con the first weekend in March.

77
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:28,095
MATT: I'll be at Lexington Comic and Toy Con in
Lexington, Kentucky. That's March 9th to the 11th.

78
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:32,739
I'll be at Otafest in Calgary, up north, May 18th
to the 20th.

79
00:06:32,739 --> 00:06:35,307
TRAVIS: Keep it within a few months, for the love of--

80
00:06:35,307 --> 00:06:42,868
MATT: And A-Kon in Texas, June 7th to the 10th. If
you are anywhere near those regions. I've said

81
00:06:42,868 --> 00:06:48,014
before, I'm going to take this off the sheet for
the future. We've said that a lot now. Hey, it's

82
00:06:48,014 --> 00:06:53,422
not my job to update that sheet. Anyway guys, I'll
remember this.

83
00:06:53,422 --> 00:07:04,180
MARISHA: You should go check out Good Fortnight
Kevin on Alpha because it's a morning show and

84
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,945
it's funny. It's dumb and it's super meta.

85
00:07:06,945 --> 00:07:17,129
MATT: Super meta funny dumb show. All right. It
appears that the dice have been culled.

86
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:20,083
LAURA: We're on the last one, so we're solid.

87
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:29,514
MATT: Then let's go ahead and dive into tonight's
episode of Critical Role.

88
00:07:29,514 --> 00:07:33,644
[click, TV static]

89
00:07:33,644 --> 00:08:51,331
[groovy Critical Role theme]

90
00:08:51,399 --> 00:09:00,519
MATT: Welcome back. Last we left off, our group of
adventurers had found their various individual

91
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:05,577
fates come together here in the city of
Trostenwald, where they had attended a carnival

92
00:09:05,577 --> 00:09:12,199
that had blown into town, had watched a horrible
occurrence happen where one of the older attendees

93
00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:19,245
transformed into this terrifying zombie creature.
Upon defeating it, you were all put under

94
00:09:19,245 --> 00:09:24,499
investigation as possible culprits for the reason
that it occurred. In trying to wander the city to

95
00:09:24,499 --> 00:09:29,599
investigate and try and clear your name, you
eventually found that there was a fiend hiding

96
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:36,295
amongst these carnival workers. This large
devil-like toad creature, which through some

97
00:09:36,295 --> 00:09:41,593
research you had found to actually be called a
nergaliid, had killed two more of the guards,

98
00:09:41,593 --> 00:09:49,188
leaving you to fend with their transformed forms,
and then fled deep into the center of the Ustaloch Lake.

99
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,402
(clattering off-camera)

100
00:09:51,402 --> 00:09:57,501
MATT: Thank you for the punctuation. Upon
gathering your supplies after a night's rest, you

101
00:09:57,501 --> 00:10:04,071
managed to, through the trade of a bottle of wine, get
passage across the lake onto the central island,

102
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:12,065
which at one time housed the abode of a witch that
had long collapsed. Waiting for nightfall, you

103
00:10:12,065 --> 00:10:19,328
approached the center of the grove that existed there on the
island and found near this ruin this same fiendish

104
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:27,298
nergaliid, as well as Toya, the 12-year-old dwarf
girl who had been affixed to him for the

105
00:10:27,298 --> 00:10:34,321
performances in the carnival. You did battle with
this large fiendish entity who summoned a cluster

106
00:10:34,321 --> 00:10:41,509
of imps and managed to knock a few of you pretty
heavily to the ground before you finished it off.

107
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:50,171
We left off as you all were finishing licking your
wounds, catching your breath, and now as the

108
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:59,340
moonlit night gets its darkest in the sky, you
figure out what the next step is in gathering means

109
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:07,318
of absolving yourselves of suspicion. As you've
all now taken a moment to yourselves, you can hear

110
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:12,717
the sound of the nearby crickets getting more and
more deafening as the silence crawls over the

111
00:11:12,717 --> 00:11:20,195
center of the lake. Toya, the young girl, still
lies unconscious. The remains of the devil toad,

112
00:11:20,195 --> 00:11:27,821
still partially burnt from the final blow
delivered by Fjord, are mostly intact above its

113
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:33,271
shoulders, head, and its legs. What would you like
to do?

114
00:11:33,271 --> 00:11:39,219
TRAVIS: Ow. We're all fucked up.

115
00:11:39,219 --> 00:11:41,408
LAURA: Does anybody need any healing?

116
00:11:41,408 --> 00:11:44,262
SAM: Oh, are you alive right now?

117
00:11:44,262 --> 00:11:48,063
TRAVIS: We're up. Just barely.

118
00:11:48,063 --> 00:11:49,970
LAURA: You need some?

119
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,195
LIAM: I'm really shabby at the moment.

120
00:11:52,195 --> 00:11:54,543
LAURA: Oh, that's too bad because I don't have any
spells left.

121
00:11:54,543 --> 00:11:58,710
LIAM: That's good. Let's go back and talk to the
cops.

122
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,048
LAURA: Should we do something with this body?

123
00:12:01,048 --> 00:12:04,134
TALIESIN: I think we need to bring it. I think we're
going to need a trophy.

124
00:12:04,134 --> 00:12:06,030
LIAM: What about just its head?

125
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,214
TALIESIN: That'll do.

126
00:12:07,214 --> 00:12:11,029
TRAVIS: It's a big head. It might be all we can
take.

127
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:15,460
LAURA: I don't know if it'll fit on the boat.
Would it fit on the boat that we came out on?

128
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,162
MATT: How much of the body?

129
00:12:18,162 --> 00:12:19,409
LAURA: The whole body.

130
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:28,854
MATT: The whole body with all of you could
probably fit. It doesn't have the usual-- you

131
00:12:28,854 --> 00:12:30,733
could probably fit it.

132
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:32,099
SAM: How about just the head?

133
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:35,832
MATT: The head it would probably do, but the full
body, I'd have to make a few rolls.

134
00:12:35,832 --> 00:12:38,508
TALIESIN: I'm going to give the body a quick
search to see if there's anything.

135
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,201
MATT: You already did.

136
00:12:40,201 --> 00:12:41,984
LAURA: Yeah, I got a bunch of rings. See?

137
00:12:41,984 --> 00:12:44,311
TALIESIN: Do I recognize any of these rings?

138
00:12:44,311 --> 00:12:45,857
MATT: No, you do not.

139
00:12:45,857 --> 00:12:48,238
TALIESIN: All right. That's disturbing.

140
00:12:48,238 --> 00:12:49,739
SAM: I got one, too.

141
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:56,715
TRAVIS: Has the head been damaged at all, or is it
mostly intact?

142
00:12:56,715 --> 00:13:01,721
MATT: It's mostly intact. There are a few gashes
on it from the general fray, but for the most part

143
00:13:01,721 --> 00:13:03,519
it's still a solid head.

144
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:09,440
TRAVIS: Molly, you've got them impressive swords.
You want to do some hacking?

145
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,268
TALIESIN: Suppose I should.

146
00:13:13,268 --> 00:13:16,404
MARISHA: I'd say you have a pretty impressive
sword, too.

147
00:13:16,404 --> 00:13:20,932
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and carve off the head.

148
00:13:20,932 --> 00:13:28,818
MATT: Okay. It's a tough form. Not only is the
exterior of its flesh blubbery and a heavy

149
00:13:28,818 --> 00:13:35,506
rubber-like substance that is glistening with
whatever mucus-like liquid it naturally produces,

150
00:13:35,506 --> 00:13:40,515
but then beneath it, the muscle sinew is extremely
tough. It takes you the better part of 20 minutes

151
00:13:40,515 --> 00:13:46,085
to finally get the head entirely off the rest of
the torso. It weighs enough to the point where

152
00:13:46,085 --> 00:13:48,801
you're going to need one or two other hands to get
it anywhere.

153
00:13:48,801 --> 00:13:50,832
TRAVIS: That's an artiste at work right there.

154
00:13:50,832 --> 00:13:54,636
TALIESIN: This is as far as I go one this one.
That's way too heavy for me.

155
00:13:54,636 --> 00:13:56,299
LIAM: It's all you, blue.

156
00:13:56,299 --> 00:13:58,122
MARISHA: I'll help you out.

157
00:13:58,122 --> 00:13:59,296
TALIESIN: I'm going to grab Toya.

158
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,464
LAURA and MARISHA: (groaning)

159
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,955
LAURA: Is Toya waking up at all?

160
00:14:01,955 --> 00:14:05,434
MATT: Toya is passed out. You'd have to try and
rouse her.

161
00:14:05,434 --> 00:14:08,859
LAURA: It's probably best not to wake her up while
we're carrying this head around.

162
00:14:08,859 --> 00:14:10,665
TALIESIN: I think that's a very good idea.

163
00:14:10,665 --> 00:14:12,123
MARISHA: Yeah, this is frightening.

164
00:14:12,123 --> 00:14:15,808
LIAM: The imps burned away?

165
00:14:15,808 --> 00:14:17,672
MATT: Yes, they turned to ash.

166
00:14:17,672 --> 00:14:19,455
LAURA: Does he have hair? What are we carrying him
by?

167
00:14:19,455 --> 00:14:21,002
MARISHA: Yeah, what are we carrying him by?

168
00:14:21,002 --> 00:14:32,462
MATT: Along the brow line there are these small
holes that could be breathing holes. You'd have to

169
00:14:32,462 --> 00:14:35,661
carry it from there, under the socket, or under
the jaw.

170
00:14:35,661 --> 00:14:37,692
LIAM: Because that's what you want to stick your
finger in.

171
00:14:37,692 --> 00:14:39,882
TRAVIS: Yeah, totally. The mucus hole.

172
00:14:39,882 --> 00:14:44,886
MARISHA: I grab the jaw and I say: "Hey, Jester."

173
00:14:44,886 --> 00:14:54,007
TALIESIN: I did share meals with this person for
two straight years. Never mind. I'm walking away.

174
00:14:54,007 --> 00:14:56,269
TRAVIS: We are fucking with his old co-worker.

175
00:14:56,269 --> 00:15:01,188
TALIESIN: I'm already walking away. I took the kid
and am walking to the boat.

176
00:15:01,188 --> 00:15:03,599
LAURA, MARISHA and TRAVIS: Sorry!

177
00:15:03,599 --> 00:15:08,156
LIAM: Caleb just retched into the grass from
watching that.

178
00:15:08,156 --> 00:15:11,840
LAURA: All right, let's carry him.

179
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,910
TALIESIN: You're the worst. You're all the worst.

180
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:19,392
LAURA: Fjord, I gave you the bag of skin. Don't
forget you have that.

181
00:15:19,392 --> 00:15:20,452
TRAVIS: I have it?

182
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:21,707
LAURA: You have the bag of slimy skin.

183
00:15:21,707 --> 00:15:27,332
TRAVIS: I'm going to salt it and hang it out to
dry.

184
00:15:27,332 --> 00:15:31,952
LIAM: If it will help tomorrow or today-- what
time is it? It's the middle of the night, isn't it?

185
00:15:31,952 --> 00:15:40,211
MATT: You approached just after dusk, so between
the slow moving in there, the combat, and the rest

186
00:15:40,211 --> 00:15:42,472
afterward it's probably close to 10:00PM.

187
00:15:42,472 --> 00:15:45,197
LIAM: I know exactly what time it is, don't I?
Yeah.

188
00:15:45,197 --> 00:15:53,113
TRAVIS: You know exactly what time it is?

189
00:15:53,113 --> 00:16:00,842
LIAM: It's something I've always been able to--
why is everybody looking at me like-- (vomiting sound)

190
00:16:00,842 --> 00:16:04,498
LAURA: Where's Frumpkin?

191
00:16:04,498 --> 00:16:06,595
LIAM: (fwoosh)

192
00:16:06,595 --> 00:16:09,331
LAURA: Oh, good.

193
00:16:09,331 --> 00:16:13,386
MATT: At this point, Molly, as you're ahead of the
group and you're making your way through the

194
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:23,728
trees, Toya begins to stir in your grasp. Her eyes
open a bit as you're holding her and she looks up

195
00:16:23,728 --> 00:16:31,620
at you, confused, eyes lolling around in the
sockets for a moment before they see you and

196
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,509
clarify. "Molly?"

197
00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:39,160
TALIESIN: I know, dear. You've been through a bit.
There's been some bad business.

198
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,475
MATT: "What happened?"

199
00:16:40,475 --> 00:16:47,257
TALIESIN: (sighs) A friend turned on us, but it's
going to be all right. I'm going to get you home,

200
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:48,704
all right?

201
00:16:48,704 --> 00:16:56,363
MATT: "Wait, where's Kylre?" She starts trying to
fight your grasp.

202
00:16:56,363 --> 00:17:00,887
TALIESIN: I'll explain it later.

203
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:04,856
MATT: She's going to try and break free of your
grasp. Are you going to attempt to hold onto her?

204
00:17:04,856 --> 00:17:05,802
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

205
00:17:05,802 --> 00:17:07,471
LIAM: How far away are they from the rest of us?

206
00:17:07,471 --> 00:17:11,745
MATT: While you guys have been doing all this,
he's gone on ahead. He's probably a good 40 to 50

207
00:17:11,745 --> 00:17:18,486
feet ahead. Go ahead and roll an athletics check.

208
00:17:18,486 --> 00:17:20,179
TALIESIN: You're a monster.

209
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:25,045
LAURA: Oh, no!

210
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:27,580
TRAVIS: Tell me you did it.

211
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,732
TALIESIN: No, it's not that bad.

212
00:17:29,732 --> 00:17:37,765
LAURA: Oh, it looked like a one from this angle.
Still pretty terrible.

213
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:43,636
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (chanting) Level two.

214
00:17:43,636 --> 00:17:48,448
LAURA: You were rolling bad on this the last game.
You need to stop rolling that one.

215
00:17:48,448 --> 00:17:50,470
MATT: Yeah, that dice needs to go away.

216
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:54,450
TALIESIN: I've got some new stuff coming in.

217
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,184
LAURA: All right.

218
00:17:56,184 --> 00:17:59,324
MARISHA: It's coming across the border. It's real
good.

219
00:17:59,324 --> 00:18:01,720
TALIESIN: Coming in from the Feywild.

220
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,754
MATT: You can choose athletics or acrobatics.

221
00:18:04,754 --> 00:18:07,692
TALIESIN: Oh. Can I reroll?

222
00:18:07,692 --> 00:18:08,903
MATT: No.

223
00:18:08,903 --> 00:18:10,515
TALIESIN: Then that's nine.

224
00:18:10,515 --> 00:18:16,991
MATT: That still beats her. She rolled a five. All
right, wanted to double-check. She's scrambling

225
00:18:16,991 --> 00:18:21,397
and as you pull her back she tries to fight for a
second and then goes limp in your grasp and goes,

226
00:18:21,397 --> 00:18:23,940
"I'm scared."

227
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:30,329
TALIESIN: I know. It's going to be a bit rough,
but it was for the best. I'm so sorry. Some people

228
00:18:30,329 --> 00:18:32,089
just turn, I'm so sorry.

229
00:18:32,089 --> 00:18:33,734
MATT: "What happened?"

230
00:18:33,734 --> 00:18:40,897
TALIESIN: He got sick. There was something inside
him. There was something that made him

231
00:18:40,897 --> 00:18:44,761
do some bad things, but it had to be taken care
of. You're going to be all right.

232
00:18:44,761 --> 00:18:56,411
MATT: She gets really quiet for a second. You get
to the boat and the gentleman earlier that you had

233
00:18:56,411 --> 00:19:01,749
passed the wine off to is sitting there waiting.
He has a small pouch that's opened with some dried

234
00:19:01,749 --> 00:19:08,053
meat that he's chewing on as he's waiting. As you guys
walk up, he says: "Oh, I see you've finished."

235
00:19:08,053 --> 00:19:10,612
LAURA and MARISHA: (groaning)

236
00:19:10,612 --> 00:19:12,850
MATT: (shouting) "What in the hell is that?!"

237
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,214
MARISHA: Move!

238
00:19:14,214 --> 00:19:17,218
LAURA: We told you we were having a party, man!

239
00:19:17,218 --> 00:19:23,420
LIAM: I was just about to suggest covering that
up, but you know, all cards on the table.

240
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:29,729
MATT: He grabs his bag of dried meat, pulls it up,
and backs up. "I didn't know-- What is that? What

241
00:19:29,729 --> 00:19:32,590
"did you do? What is that?"

242
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:35,291
MARISHA: I said we were going to be doing some
frog digging.

243
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:38,364
TALIESIN: Biggest frog you've ever seen.

244
00:19:38,364 --> 00:19:50,124
MATT: There's a pause before this tiny screeching
sound begins to emit from Toya. This high pitched

245
00:19:50,124 --> 00:19:55,251
and barely audible squeak as Toya begins to
<i>scream</i>.

246
00:19:55,251 --> 00:19:58,164
LAURA: I take off my cloak and I cover the head
with it.

247
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:02,463
TALIESIN: I was trying to keep her away from
that.

248
00:20:02,463 --> 00:20:04,631
MATT: It's hard to keep her away from <i>that</i>.

249
00:20:04,631 --> 00:20:16,958
TRAVIS: We literally cut the head off Barney and
shoved it in her face. (singsong) I love you.

250
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:26,033
TALIESIN: The Barney that been raising her, yes.
Really take that in. Off to a great start.

251
00:20:26,033 --> 00:20:30,214
MATT: After Jester throws her cloak over Toya--

252
00:20:30,214 --> 00:20:32,674
LAURA: No, not Toya. Over the head.

253
00:20:32,674 --> 00:20:37,458
TALIESIN: I'm trying to keep her quiet.

254
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:41,828
MATT: She's sobbing into your arms at this point.
You feel her body shaking against your grasp.

255
00:20:41,828 --> 00:20:46,299
LAURA: I feel so bad.

256
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:48,088
TALIESIN: You should.

257
00:20:48,088 --> 00:20:50,097
SAM: Poor girl.

258
00:20:50,097 --> 00:20:54,569
TALIESIN: I'm going to take her to the front of
the boat and keep her far away from all that.

259
00:20:54,569 --> 00:21:02,530
LIAM: I pull Fjord away for a moment, about ten or
15 feet away. This man in the boat has seen all of

260
00:21:02,585 --> 00:21:07,352
you who are supposed to be under house arrest. We
cannot have him talking to the authorities.

261
00:21:07,352 --> 00:21:08,796
SAM: Should we kill him?

262
00:21:08,796 --> 00:21:12,780
LIAM: Jeez! Come here.

263
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:18,280
TRAVIS: I have a good feeling that this guy is a
man of upstanding nature. I'm sure he'll keep it

264
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,515
to himself.

265
00:21:19,515 --> 00:21:20,670
LIAM: Oh, that's very trusting.

266
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:21,617
TRAVIS: Yeah, of course.

267
00:21:21,617 --> 00:21:23,915
SAM: We gave him one bottle of wine. That's not
very much.

268
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:26,202
TRAVIS: We have another bottle. Don't we?

269
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,622
MARISHA: Yes?

270
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:31,589
LIAM: Oh, you're here too, now. Great, it's a party.

271
00:21:31,589 --> 00:21:40,003
MARISHA: We could also toss him a bit of gold if
we think it would make him forget the night.

272
00:21:40,003 --> 00:21:44,753
TRAVIS: After all, we came to him, right? I would
prefer not to use any violence.

273
00:21:44,753 --> 00:21:48,934
LIAM: I'm not suggesting that, but it's either
violence or giving him a little something.

274
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:51,955
MARISHA: What makes you think he's going to go
talk to the authorities?

275
00:21:51,955 --> 00:21:53,490
LIAM: You want to leave it to chance?

276
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,854
MARISHA: Who cares?

277
00:21:54,854 --> 00:22:00,248
SAM: This is a small town, Beau. Everyone talks to
everyone. You taught us that.

278
00:22:00,248 --> 00:22:03,367
MARISHA: I did, but everyone also hated the
circus.

279
00:22:03,367 --> 00:22:06,886
LIAM: Molly, do you want to join this
conversation?

280
00:22:06,886 --> 00:22:13,115
TALIESIN: I've been listening. I pull out a gold
coin. Give him this.

281
00:22:13,115 --> 00:22:16,565
LAURA: Maybe one more. Or two more.

282
00:22:16,565 --> 00:22:18,477
MARISHA: I pull two out as well.

283
00:22:18,477 --> 00:22:20,232
LAURA: I'll pull three out.

284
00:22:20,232 --> 00:22:26,916
MATT: He's recessed to the very back of his boat,
wide-eyed as you approach.

285
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:31,212
TRAVIS: You're right. Coin is a good idea.

286
00:22:31,212 --> 00:22:33,720
LAURA: Go charm him, Fjord. You're very charming.

287
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,112
MARISHA: You've got fisherman vibes.

288
00:22:37,112 --> 00:22:41,074
TRAVIS: Oh, shit. Wait a minute. How long did that
fight take?

289
00:22:41,074 --> 00:22:45,527
MATT: You've returned to your normal half-orc
form.

290
00:22:45,527 --> 00:22:50,858
TRAVIS: Oh, cool. Okay. There was an old man who
was with us before.

291
00:22:50,858 --> 00:22:54,010
TALIESIN: And now there's a little girl. It's all
coming full circle.

292
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:57,301
TRAVIS: Maybe we give him the extra bottle of wine
and <i>you</i> go talk to him.

293
00:22:57,301 --> 00:23:00,309
LIAM: Walking up to the boat--

294
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:03,708
MARISHA: Here. (clink)

295
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:09,763
LIAM: Collecting it as I go. The thing of it is,
we've just done Trostenwald-- what was that?

296
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:21,642
Never mind. --a great service. There was an unsavory element--
did you know the circus was in town?

297
00:23:21,642 --> 00:23:32,852
Doesn't matter. There was a bad fellow-- that's his head--
with them. It's no fault of theirs. You pick weird folk up on the

298
00:23:32,852 --> 00:23:34,855
road in the circus. Isn't that right, Mollymauk?

299
00:23:34,855 --> 00:23:36,348
TALIESIN: I'll let that go.

300
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:40,291
MATT: He reaches over, grabs the oar from the
side, and lifts the cloak off the face.

301
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:45,982
LIAM: That's going to rile you up. That's a bad
idea.

302
00:23:45,982 --> 00:23:48,868
MATT: "It doesn't look like a savory creature."

303
00:23:48,868 --> 00:23:51,809
LAURA: It wasn't. Trust us.

304
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:54,505
TALIESIN: Took a lot out of us.

305
00:23:54,505 --> 00:24:03,581
LIAM: But the situation in town is a little
political. We're going to take this thing out of

306
00:24:03,581 --> 00:24:10,511
here and I'm going to report it to the
authorities. We don't really want to create a stir

307
00:24:10,511 --> 00:24:13,963
and frighten people here. I hope you will take--

308
00:24:13,963 --> 00:24:20,520
LAURA: We like to be unsung heroes. You know, like
superheroes with secret identities.

309
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,273
MARISHA: Yeah, we're an underground anonymous
activist group.

310
00:24:24,273 --> 00:24:30,604
LAURA: Yeah, that helps people. But if everyone
knows who we are, it'll be much harder to fight

311
00:24:30,604 --> 00:24:31,806
all the crime.

312
00:24:31,806 --> 00:24:33,672
LIAM: Try to focus on the gold.

313
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:45,266
MATT: He slowly reaches out and takes it from your
hand. "All right. I trust it was a bad thing. So

314
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:52,148
"I'm going to take you back, and then you promise
I'll never see you again?"

315
00:24:52,148 --> 00:24:56,507
LAURA: We'll try really hard to not let you see
us.

316
00:24:56,507 --> 00:24:58,097
TALIESIN: If you see us, we won't make eye
contact.

317
00:24:58,097 --> 00:24:59,938
LAURA: We'll pretend we don't know you.

318
00:24:59,938 --> 00:25:02,373
MATT: "That includes the goblin."

319
00:25:02,373 --> 00:25:06,759
SAM: I was never here. We never had this
conversation.

320
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:08,509
LAURA: She's a halfling.

321
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:12,089
MATT: He glances over and takes a closer look.

322
00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:15,611
SAM: I'm very ugly for a halfling.

323
00:25:15,611 --> 00:25:23,324
MATT: "Let's just get back to shore." He grabs the
oar, takes the bottle of wine that he had mostly

324
00:25:23,324 --> 00:25:27,568
drunk by himself before, and polishes it off in
one series of gulps.

325
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:30,742
LAURA: Don't boat drunk.

326
00:25:30,742 --> 00:25:37,746
MATT: As you all gather up onto the ship, he
begins to paddle you back towards the western

327
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:41,116
shore of the Ustaloch to the outskirts of
Trostenwald.

328
00:25:41,116 --> 00:25:46,711
MARISHA: When we get to the shore, we should
probably split up.

329
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:50,680
LAURA: How are we going to get this giant head to
the authorities?

330
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,017
MARISHA: That's a good question.

331
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:57,172
LAURA: Oh, I got an idea! Why don't you go get a
wagon as soon as we get to shore, and we'll help

332
00:25:57,172 --> 00:26:00,636
you load it onto the wagon, and then you just take
it on in yourself.

333
00:26:00,636 --> 00:26:03,722
TALIESIN: It's a shame we didn't just get rid of a
wagon not more than one night ago.

334
00:26:03,722 --> 00:26:09,771
SAM: Why do we need to take it with us? Us
traipsing through town with a giant head seems

335
00:26:09,771 --> 00:26:14,508
like it would draw focus. Why don't we just put it
somewhere and send the authorities out here to

336
00:26:14,508 --> 00:26:15,736
find it later?

337
00:26:15,736 --> 00:26:17,817
TALIESIN: Someone else may get to it, or something
might happen.

338
00:26:17,817 --> 00:26:19,509
SAM: What are they going to do with it? It's a big
head!

339
00:26:19,509 --> 00:26:21,500
MARISHA: We could leave someone with it, and we
can just--

340
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,178
TRAVIS: I could stand guard as a crownsguard next
to it.

341
00:26:25,178 --> 00:26:27,786
TALIESIN: What could people do with the head of a
creature like this?

342
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:32,498
MATT: What could people do with the head of a
creature like this? Who knows.

343
00:26:32,498 --> 00:26:33,690
TALIESIN: Would I know?

344
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:35,473
LAURA: They could make a lot of soup.

345
00:26:35,473 --> 00:26:42,155
MATT: They could turn it in for-- there's a lot of
poor folk here. If they had a large looking odd

346
00:26:42,155 --> 00:26:44,473
creature, that's worth some gold.

347
00:26:44,473 --> 00:26:47,428
SAM: We can hide it. Maybe some of us have skills
to hide things.

348
00:26:47,428 --> 00:26:52,857
LIAM: I think Fjord had a good idea, which is if
you can disguise yourself as a crownsguard again,

349
00:26:52,857 --> 00:26:55,907
you wait with it. You guys get back to the tavern,
yeah?

350
00:26:55,907 --> 00:26:57,761
MARISHA: You can go and alert the authorities.

351
00:26:57,761 --> 00:27:02,825
LIAM: Now, here's the thing. I may be speaking out
of turn-- I know I don't know you very well, but

352
00:27:02,825 --> 00:27:10,522
it feels like the thing that we all share in
common here is that we don't wish to make-- maybe

353
00:27:10,522 --> 00:27:14,010
not you-- make a big splash here.

354
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:16,122
TRAVIS: Agreed. The less attention, the better.

355
00:27:16,122 --> 00:27:17,950
LAURA: Well, you know, whatever.

356
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:20,292
TRAVIS: The less attention, the better.

357
00:27:20,292 --> 00:27:22,119
TALIESIN: For the moment.

358
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:27,700
LIAM: Okay, so maybe I'm 70 to 80 percent correct,
but we're all in this together.

359
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,080
MARISHA: And gold. I like getting paid.

360
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:36,201
TALIESIN: We need to get this one back to the
circus, too. You might be helpful for that.

361
00:27:36,201 --> 00:27:45,515
LIAM: I don't want to make a big thing. I'm going
to go the authorities, to-- my keen mind tells me

362
00:27:45,515 --> 00:27:47,458
that woman's name was--?

363
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:49,758
MATT: Oh, the-- sorry.

364
00:27:49,758 --> 00:27:51,435
LIAM: Yeah, the one who wanted to go eat.

365
00:27:51,435 --> 00:27:52,433
MATT: Yes, you're talking about--

366
00:27:52,433 --> 00:27:53,374
TRAVIS: Norda?

367
00:27:53,374 --> 00:27:55,600
MATT: Yes, Lawmaster Norda.

368
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:07,846
LIAM: Norda? I want to go to her and citizen's
arrest kind of thing. Keep it quiet, don't need

369
00:28:07,846 --> 00:28:14,920
big accolades, will take gold, and then I'll bring
that back and we can divvy that up. That's no problem.

370
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:20,082
TRAVIS: I like it. As soon as other crownsguard
arrive with Norda and the rest of whoever you

371
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:23,223
bring to the scene, maybe I can go with you and
help return Toya.

372
00:28:23,223 --> 00:28:27,795
LAURA: You disappear quickly, because if you get
drawn into that investigation, it would be bad.

373
00:28:27,795 --> 00:28:33,595
LIAM: Right, and if nobody recognizes you-- Do you
remember any of the guards that were in town that

374
00:28:33,595 --> 00:28:36,214
you could make yourself look like specifically?

375
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,440
LAURA: Oh!

376
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,773
MARISHA: What was that guy's name?

377
00:28:38,773 --> 00:28:41,148
LAURA: What were the two guards that keep coming
to the tavern?

378
00:28:41,148 --> 00:28:42,754
MARISHA: Oh, wait!

379
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:44,893
LAURA: We wrote their names down.

380
00:28:44,893 --> 00:28:46,135
MARISHA: Jonas and Lucas.

381
00:28:46,135 --> 00:28:47,434
LAURA: That's right!

382
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:50,129
SAM and MARISHA: The Jonas Brothers.

383
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:53,712
MATT: They're not related at all.

384
00:28:53,712 --> 00:29:01,779
LIAM: DM, question. The two zombified back at the
circus tents, were they burnt to a crisp beyond

385
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:02,832
recognition?

386
00:29:02,832 --> 00:29:05,499
MATT: One of them was, and they have been
discovered.

387
00:29:05,499 --> 00:29:12,079
LIAM: Yeah, but was he recognizable? Did we leave
him looking like that dude at the end of The Last

388
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:14,510
Crusade after he drank from the wrong cup?

389
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:19,823
MATT: With some time, he could be identified.

390
00:29:19,823 --> 00:29:23,520
LIAM: Okay. Well, the Jonas Brothers it is,
friends.

391
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:34,005
SAM: Just to game this out. You, Caleb, someone
who is not suspected of a crime, is going to bring

392
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:37,768
the severed head of a member of the circus to the
police--

393
00:29:37,768 --> 00:29:40,425
LAURA: No, he's going to go to the police and
bring them to the head.

394
00:29:40,425 --> 00:29:47,255
SAM: Either way. You, Caleb, someone who is not
suspected of a crime, is going to point the police

395
00:29:47,255 --> 00:29:53,167
to the severed head of a member of the circus with
no evidence showing what that thing was or that it

396
00:29:53,167 --> 00:30:01,836
was evil, and that will somehow not implicate
other people who were not with us at the time. How

397
00:30:01,836 --> 00:30:04,805
is this going to prove their innocence, just
showing a head?

398
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:10,137
LIAM: They already believe that the circus is
terrible. I think they were just going to confirm

399
00:30:10,137 --> 00:30:11,536
their own suspicions.

400
00:30:11,536 --> 00:30:22,185
MARISHA: Also, Toya. If she would speak honestly,
she would absolve all of us.

401
00:30:22,185 --> 00:30:27,691
TRAVIS: I think Beau makes a very good point.
Without Toya's testimony we're in trouble.

402
00:30:27,691 --> 00:30:29,549
TALIESIN: I'm hoping Toya will--

403
00:30:29,549 --> 00:30:35,581
LIAM: Well, that's a sticky situation. Because
what if she talks about my friends who were there

404
00:30:35,581 --> 00:30:36,952
with me?

405
00:30:36,952 --> 00:30:40,773
TALIESIN: She knows what to say when guards are
asking questions.

406
00:30:40,773 --> 00:30:43,593
LIAM: It looks like she knows how to go off like a
siren.

407
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:45,369
TALIESIN: She's had a bad night.

408
00:30:45,369 --> 00:30:48,353
LIAM: I'm at one hit point, I understand.

409
00:30:48,353 --> 00:30:57,917
TALIESIN: We'll have a talk. We'll get her to some
people who can calm her down and make sure she

410
00:30:57,917 --> 00:31:00,098
remembers how we take care of each other.

411
00:31:00,098 --> 00:31:05,510
MATT: "If there's something you want to ask me,
I'm right here." You're all in this boat as it

412
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:07,520
makes its way across the Ustaloch.

413
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:12,111
TALIESIN: Sorry, dear. I was hoping that we didn't
have to have this conversation in front of strangers.

414
00:31:12,111 --> 00:31:14,483
MATT: "Can someone please explain to me what's
going on?"

415
00:31:14,483 --> 00:31:22,295
LIAM: Can you explain to us, maybe, your
relationship with Kylre? If that was his name.

416
00:31:22,295 --> 00:31:29,194
MATT: "I mean, that's the name I've ever known."

417
00:31:29,194 --> 00:31:31,526
LIAM: Let's talk about the killing part, though.

418
00:31:31,526 --> 00:31:41,283
MATT: "I don't know anything about that. When we
did the show the other night, the horrible man--"

419
00:31:41,283 --> 00:31:47,448
TALIESIN: It turns out that that was-- Kylre did
that.

420
00:31:47,448 --> 00:31:49,272
MATT: "Why?"

421
00:31:49,272 --> 00:31:56,026
TALIESIN: I don't know why. Something snapped.
He's hurt and killed a lot of people. We think

422
00:31:56,026 --> 00:31:58,480
that maybe he's been making you sick too.

423
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,515
LAURA: Have you ever heard him say nergaliid?

424
00:32:01,515 --> 00:32:05,906
MATT: "No. Where's Gustav?"

425
00:32:05,906 --> 00:32:11,670
TALIESIN: Gustav is having trouble with the
authorities. We're going to need to all work

426
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,537
together to save him.

427
00:32:13,537 --> 00:32:18,497
TRAVIS: Unfortunately, the authorities think that
Gustav and the circus are responsible for what

428
00:32:18,497 --> 00:32:25,023
happened. Actually, it's just Kylre. He wasn't
what you thought he was, I'm afraid.

429
00:32:25,023 --> 00:32:30,568
TALIESIN: The twins are being the twins, Ornna's
being Ornna. But I think we can save everybody. We

430
00:32:30,568 --> 00:32:33,735
just need to take care of each other.

431
00:32:33,735 --> 00:32:36,550
MATT: "He was my friend, though."

432
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:41,502
LIAM: Child, how did you grow so close to him?

433
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:56,175
MATT: "Gustav put us together for our act and he
protected me. I felt safe around him. He didn't

434
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:59,791
"let anybody get too close I didn't want to."

435
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:02,310
LIAM: Did he communicate with you in some way?

436
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,109
MATT: "He talked."

437
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:05,592
LIAM: What did you talk about?

438
00:33:05,592 --> 00:33:16,277
MATT: "Well, we talked about everybody else in the
family. We talked about how I missed not having a

439
00:33:16,277 --> 00:33:22,352
"family. He didn't talk about himself much, but it
was mainly just little games."

440
00:33:22,352 --> 00:33:26,182
LAURA: Did he teach you how to sing to affect
people's minds?

441
00:33:26,182 --> 00:33:33,189
MATT: "No. That was how I got by before I met
these guys."

442
00:33:33,189 --> 00:33:43,247
LIAM: I am sure this is painful for you. You are
young. Sometimes people we feel we know can be

443
00:33:43,247 --> 00:33:54,791
someone else. Regrettably, this is one of those
instances. He was a dangerous thing. It is very

444
00:33:54,791 --> 00:34:03,649
important that this is buried here. You want to
travel on with the circus and with Mollymauk and

445
00:34:03,649 --> 00:34:12,196
your friends. That thing tried to kill us. It did
kill things in Trostenwald. Who knows what it

446
00:34:12,196 --> 00:34:15,668
would have done to you, child?

447
00:34:15,668 --> 00:34:18,796
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

448
00:34:18,796 --> 00:34:24,305
LIAM: Oof.

449
00:34:24,305 --> 00:34:25,820
SAM: It's good.

450
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,595
LIAM: No, it's not good.

451
00:34:27,595 --> 00:34:29,323
TALIESIN: I felt it.

452
00:34:29,323 --> 00:34:31,141
TRAVIS: It's Sam good.

453
00:34:31,141 --> 00:34:34,593
LIAM: It is only a six. Rolled very low.

454
00:34:34,593 --> 00:34:40,596
MATT: As you're talking to her, her eyes keep
flickering off of your face and over towards Beau.

455
00:34:40,596 --> 00:34:46,002
You watch her curl back into herself and get
quiet.

456
00:34:46,002 --> 00:34:52,511
TRAVIS: It might do for you to apologize.

457
00:34:52,511 --> 00:34:57,862
MARISHA: Sorry.

458
00:34:57,862 --> 00:35:02,313
LAURA: Sorry for what, Beau?

459
00:35:02,313 --> 00:35:04,363
MARISHA: Really, Jester?

460
00:35:04,363 --> 00:35:05,525
LAURA: Really.

461
00:35:05,525 --> 00:35:07,014
TALIESIN: No, I want to hear this too.

462
00:35:07,014 --> 00:35:13,824
MARISHA: Sorry for choking you with my stick.

463
00:35:13,824 --> 00:35:18,465
TALIESIN: Somehow that was better than what I was
hoping for.

464
00:35:18,465 --> 00:35:20,561
LIAM: Rated T for Teen.

465
00:35:20,561 --> 00:35:26,776
SAM: And I'll never do it again?

466
00:35:26,776 --> 00:35:35,580
(laughter)

467
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:45,613
MARISHA: And I'll never do it again. As long as
you don't try that again, of course, I guess.

468
00:35:45,613 --> 00:35:54,163
LAURA: It was only because Kylre was trying to
kill us and she was afraid that you were helping him.

469
00:35:54,163 --> 00:35:58,396
MARISHA: Yeah, I wasn't trying to hurt you. I was
just trying to get you to stop singing. But it was

470
00:35:58,396 --> 00:36:01,007
so abrasive.

471
00:36:01,007 --> 00:36:05,281
TALIESIN: You know how people outside can be. The
mean girl was just afraid of you and we're going

472
00:36:05,281 --> 00:36:08,004
to let her go on this one.

473
00:36:08,004 --> 00:36:09,569
MATT: "I'm tired."

474
00:36:09,569 --> 00:36:11,227
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know. Let's get you home, okay?

475
00:36:11,227 --> 00:36:15,035
MATT: She leans into you, Molly. After a few
minutes, she falls asleep against you.

476
00:36:15,035 --> 00:36:17,129
LAURA: That went well, I think.

477
00:36:17,129 --> 00:36:19,730
TALIESIN: Choked you with my stick?!

478
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,334
MARISHA: I did.

479
00:36:21,334 --> 00:36:25,042
LAURA: She apologized for exactly what she did.

480
00:36:25,042 --> 00:36:28,241
TALIESIN: That was certainly memorable.

481
00:36:28,241 --> 00:36:38,830
MATT: "All right, we're here." The boat hits the
edge of the dock. He hops off and pulls the rope

482
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:44,201
up. Slowly manages the boat over to the side of the
dock, ties it up.

483
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:47,504
LAURA: How many people are around the dock right
now?

484
00:36:47,504 --> 00:36:52,286
MATT: There's no boats at the dock that are being
manned currently. There are a few boats out on the

485
00:36:52,286 --> 00:36:57,754
water that you saw in the distance. There are some
night fishermen. There's nobody immediately in the

486
00:36:57,754 --> 00:36:58,811
vicinity.

487
00:36:58,811 --> 00:37:03,920
TRAVIS: Okay, I'm going to hop off the boat and
break eye contact with the captain of the boat so

488
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,403
that I can Disguise Self into a crownsguard.

489
00:37:08,403 --> 00:37:12,863
LIAM: I talk to him while you do that. You have
your wine, you have your gold. Thank you very

490
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:17,742
much, it is much appreciated. It was a lovely
trip.

491
00:37:17,742 --> 00:37:25,122
MATT: "Yes that's fine. Just, please, get out of
my boat."

492
00:37:25,122 --> 00:37:30,991
TRAVIS: (English accent) Who goes there? What is
this, what have you brought?

493
00:37:30,991 --> 00:37:34,809
LIAM: Oh, I have felled a beast.

494
00:37:34,809 --> 00:37:39,329
MATT: "They got in my boat. I-- they--"

495
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:41,736
TRAVIS: Are you responsible for this?

496
00:37:41,736 --> 00:37:48,037
MATT: "No. They took over my boat and forced me to
take them to the middle island there."

497
00:37:48,037 --> 00:37:53,658
LIAM: You will not take credit for my kill. I have
killed this thing and I want it to be watched. I

498
00:37:53,658 --> 00:37:57,632
am going to the authorities. We will bring them
back and get this sorted.

499
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:01,772
TRAVIS: It's a horrifying-looking creature. You
are to be commended for your bravery. Lawmaster

500
00:38:01,772 --> 00:38:04,576
Norda will want to know about this immediately.

501
00:38:04,576 --> 00:38:06,333
LAURA: You weren't here.

502
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:08,653
MATT: Make a deception check with advantage.

503
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:10,918
TALIESIN: This is so weird.

504
00:38:10,918 --> 00:38:15,511
LAURA: I'm just holding a bowling ball.

505
00:38:15,511 --> 00:38:18,773
TRAVIS: 21. No, 20.

506
00:38:18,773 --> 00:38:27,820
MATT: He goes, "I want nothing to do with this.
Good night." He helps each of you quickly get off

507
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:32,218
the boat. Ties and locks it up and makes a
beeline--

508
00:38:32,218 --> 00:38:35,282
SAM: (shouting) We'll come to your house with your
share of the reward.

509
00:38:35,282 --> 00:38:38,904
(laughter)

510
00:38:38,904 --> 00:38:42,613
TRAVIS: All right, we can't waste any time.

511
00:38:42,613 --> 00:38:45,403
LAURA: Can I lob the head up over the side of the
boat?

512
00:38:45,403 --> 00:38:47,509
MATT: Make a strength check.

513
00:38:47,509 --> 00:38:49,620
LIAM: Monster calves.

514
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,869
LAURA: Oh no.

515
00:38:50,869 --> 00:38:52,229
SAM: You're strong, though.

516
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:53,448
TALIESIN: Are you?

517
00:38:53,448 --> 00:38:56,005
LIAM: Yeah, but at level two you need to roll
higher than a three.

518
00:38:56,005 --> 00:38:57,742
LAURA: Eight!

519
00:38:57,742 --> 00:39:04,674
MATT: You get it partway up and it begins sliding
back into the boat and plops into the boat and

520
00:39:04,674 --> 00:39:06,892
goes (bouncing) and you have to catch yourself.

521
00:39:06,892 --> 00:39:08,982
TRAVIS: Tongue and mouth just (lolling).

522
00:39:08,982 --> 00:39:10,698
MATT: It's terrifying.

523
00:39:10,698 --> 00:39:15,287
LAURA: All right, I need help. It's still covered,
don't worry. She can't see what we're doing, it's

524
00:39:15,287 --> 00:39:17,002
covered with my cloak.

525
00:39:17,002 --> 00:39:18,107
SAM: I'll help you.

526
00:39:18,107 --> 00:39:22,226
LAURA: By the way, it's a little tiny cloak. It's
like a half cape so it's like--

527
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:25,477
TALIESIN: It's like a napkin on a buffalo.

528
00:39:25,477 --> 00:39:28,084
MATT: A doily on a couch.

529
00:39:28,084 --> 00:39:29,244
SAM: I'll help you.

530
00:39:29,244 --> 00:39:30,336
LAURA: It's going to squish you.

531
00:39:30,336 --> 00:39:34,187
SAM: That's all right, I'm strong. One, two,
three!

532
00:39:34,187 --> 00:39:36,658
MATT: Eventually you guys get it up onto the
dock.

533
00:39:36,658 --> 00:39:38,501
LAURA: Oh, that's good.

534
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:42,995
TRAVIS: Molly, do you intend to keep Toya here or
do you need to take her back?

535
00:39:42,995 --> 00:39:45,758
TALIESIN: Take her right back. No one can know
that she's been anywhere.

536
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:50,898
LIAM: That is correct. Take her and sequester her
with the family so not a peep gets out.

537
00:39:50,898 --> 00:39:53,827
TALIESIN: We'll explain to her what needs to be
done.

538
00:39:53,827 --> 00:39:56,947
MARISHA: How do we trust you all won't skip town in
the middle of the night?

539
00:39:56,947 --> 00:39:59,511
TALIESIN: We still have people in the lockup.

540
00:39:59,511 --> 00:40:01,667
LAURA: Gustav's in jail still.

541
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:03,184
MARISHA: So?

542
00:40:03,184 --> 00:40:04,894
LAURA: Some people are loyal.

543
00:40:04,894 --> 00:40:13,308
TALIESIN: I'll be back and I have to show back up
with you people anyway. I'm going to get her as

544
00:40:13,308 --> 00:40:14,598
quickly as possible.

545
00:40:14,598 --> 00:40:16,461
MATT: The rest of you guys are doing?

546
00:40:16,461 --> 00:40:19,747
LAURA: Who is not very stealthy here?

547
00:40:19,747 --> 00:40:22,095
TRAVIS: I'm keeping watch over the toad head.

548
00:40:22,095 --> 00:40:25,078
MARISHA: I have a plus six to my stealth.

549
00:40:25,078 --> 00:40:27,605
TALIESIN: I wouldn't say no to it before I take
off.

550
00:40:27,605 --> 00:40:33,075
LAURA: Oh that's true, you're sneaking back to the
carnival. I give you a nice little blessing.

551
00:40:33,075 --> 00:40:36,061
LIAM: You're going to stay with your new friend.
You can't come to--

552
00:40:36,061 --> 00:40:38,168
SAM: I'm not coming with you?

553
00:40:38,168 --> 00:40:41,266
LIAM: Not this time. It's not-- you know why.

554
00:40:41,266 --> 00:40:49,277
SAM: What if you're in trouble? You're very hurt.
You've had a terrible night.

555
00:40:49,277 --> 00:40:56,216
LIAM: If any problem should arise, I'll send
Frumpkin straight away to you.

556
00:40:56,216 --> 00:41:01,621
SAM: Unless you're dead. No one's going to be
around to save you if you get into trouble.

557
00:41:01,621 --> 00:41:03,419
LIAM: I'm almost dead already.

558
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,712
SAM: Yeah, that's not good.

559
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,681
LAURA: That's not comforting, Caleb.

560
00:41:06,681 --> 00:41:18,137
LIAM: Nott, this is what I talked to you about the
other night. These are our friends and we're going

561
00:41:18,137 --> 00:41:24,037
to sort this out and figure out what we do next.
It has been you and me, now it is you and me and

562
00:41:24,037 --> 00:41:26,634
them. Okay? You're with your blue friend here.

563
00:41:26,634 --> 00:41:28,859
LAURA: You can hold my hand.

564
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:33,708
LIAM: I'll be back. I'm just going to have a
conversation. We have gotten out of prisons

565
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:36,780
before, you and I. I'm not worried about that.

566
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,880
SAM: Her hands are very warm.

567
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,026
LAURA: I'm warm blooded.

568
00:41:43,026 --> 00:41:45,386
LIAM: Well, she was just holding the throbbing head.

569
00:41:45,386 --> 00:41:49,262
SAM: Oh god.

570
00:41:49,262 --> 00:41:51,226
LAURA: Nott, you were too.

571
00:41:51,226 --> 00:41:54,756
SAM: That's true. But I didn't have my fingers in
the holes.

572
00:41:54,756 --> 00:42:02,871
LAURA: Should I leave my cloak here over the head,
sir, good sir, guard man?

573
00:42:02,871 --> 00:42:08,037
TRAVIS: It's fucking me, right? We know it's still
me. I'm right here.

574
00:42:08,037 --> 00:42:10,929
MARIASHA: We're not RPing still?

575
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:12,507
TRAVIS: No.

576
00:42:12,507 --> 00:42:13,999
MARISHA: Sorry.

577
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:15,437
TRAVIS: You can do what you want.

578
00:42:15,437 --> 00:42:17,083
LAURA: Should I leave my cloak here or should I
take it with me?

579
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:18,868
TRAVIS: Sure, I'll make a dramatic flourish of
it.

580
00:42:18,868 --> 00:42:22,022
LAURA: Just make sure you bring it back home.

581
00:42:22,022 --> 00:42:24,409
MARISHA: I feel like the cloak is identifying to
you.

582
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:28,212
TRAVIS: Take it with you, scratch that. Good
idea.

583
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:31,776
MARISHA: Like where did this really pretty pink
and lavender cloak come from?

584
00:42:31,776 --> 00:42:32,859
LAURA: It's green.

585
00:42:32,859 --> 00:42:35,481
MARISHA: I'm sorry, green. I haven't looked at the
art.

586
00:42:35,481 --> 00:42:39,246
SAM: It's nighttime, the moonlight makes
everything sort of look purple.

587
00:42:39,246 --> 00:42:44,059
TALIESIN: That's canon.

588
00:42:44,059 --> 00:42:46,936
TRAVIS: All right, go quickly.

589
00:42:46,936 --> 00:42:48,987
LAURA: Okay, we stealth away.

590
00:42:48,987 --> 00:42:50,633
TALIESIN: What is my stealth bonus now?

591
00:42:50,633 --> 00:42:52,018
LAURA: You just get advantage.

592
00:42:52,018 --> 00:42:54,710
MATT: We'll get to you in just a second. The rest
of you guys make a stealth check, please.

593
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:57,422
LIAM: I don't need to cause I'm just taking a
stroll.

594
00:42:57,422 --> 00:42:59,029
MATT: Nope. For those of you who are--

595
00:42:59,029 --> 00:43:00,885
MARISHA: Ten total.

596
00:43:00,885 --> 00:43:03,540
MATT: That's ten.

597
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,168
LAURA: Seven.

598
00:43:05,168 --> 00:43:07,840
SAM: 26.

599
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,420
LIAM: Yep, that's my girl.

600
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:22,161
MATT: Okay, before we get to you. As you guys make
your way back to the Nestled Nook Inn, you come to

601
00:43:22,161 --> 00:43:28,499
the intersection where the alleyway leads you back
to where the rope you had originally let down was

602
00:43:28,499 --> 00:43:35,893
placed. The rope is still there, in the darkness.
As you make your way into the alley a voice goes,

603
00:43:35,893 --> 00:43:42,048
"Excuse me." The three of you glance over and you
see a crownsguard at the end of the alley that's

604
00:43:42,048 --> 00:43:47,156
currently there with his arms crossed. "Can I help
you?"

605
00:43:47,156 --> 00:43:49,724
LAURA: Is our back to him still?

606
00:43:49,724 --> 00:43:53,838
MATT: He's to the side. You guys are all looking
up at the rope now and he's to the right of you.

607
00:43:53,838 --> 00:44:01,067
LAURA: Is it still dark out?

608
00:44:01,067 --> 00:44:04,976
MATT: Yes. It's close to midnight at this time.

609
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:17,414
LAURA: Oh my god. Has anybody seen my shoe that I
dropped earlier around here?

610
00:44:17,414 --> 00:44:21,015
MARISHA: I immediately drop to my knees and start
looking for a shoe.

611
00:44:21,015 --> 00:44:23,038
TRAVIS: What, what?

612
00:44:23,038 --> 00:44:24,366
SAM: Did you say a shoe?

613
00:44:24,366 --> 00:44:27,881
MATT: I would like for you to make a-- (laughs)

614
00:44:27,881 --> 00:44:30,307
TRAVIS: You turned into Mr. Rogers?

615
00:44:30,307 --> 00:44:32,260
SAM: A shoe!?

616
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:37,765
MATT: I would like for you to make a deception
check, with disadvantage please.

617
00:44:37,765 --> 00:44:40,747
SAM: My shoe!

618
00:44:40,747 --> 00:44:44,412
LAURA: Eight.

619
00:44:44,412 --> 00:44:54,069
MATT: As Beau's on the ground frantically
searching for a shoe and Nott's there in the

620
00:44:54,069 --> 00:45:00,821
darkness, the guard with his arms crossed goes
(whistles). He begins to walk and approach you as

621
00:45:00,821 --> 00:45:05,501
two more guards close off the other side of the
alley and they begin to come up to you guys.

622
00:45:05,501 --> 00:45:07,169
TRAVIS: How far away are they from me? Too far?

623
00:45:07,169 --> 00:45:08,279
MATT: Too far.

624
00:45:08,279 --> 00:45:10,009
MARISHA: Drop one of those rings, drop a ring!

625
00:45:10,009 --> 00:45:14,820
LAURA: It's not a shoe! I drop a ring. Wait, did
we take a short rest when we were on the boat? We

626
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,199
did. It was a short rest on the boat.

627
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:17,963
MATT: To get across, I would say I'd allow a short
rest.

628
00:45:17,963 --> 00:45:21,836
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to cast Invoke Duplicity.
Behind the guard.

629
00:45:21,836 --> 00:45:28,269
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check to see if they
notice you suddenly casting a spell, or a

630
00:45:28,269 --> 00:45:29,740
spell-like effect.

631
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:32,809
LAURA: Please please please. Natural 20!

632
00:45:32,809 --> 00:45:34,223
(cheering)

633
00:45:34,223 --> 00:45:41,606
MATT: Okay, so you Invoke Duplicity. Another
version of you appears behind one of three guards.

634
00:45:41,606 --> 00:45:42,757
What are you doing?

635
00:45:42,757 --> 00:45:48,309
LAURA: Oh God. Oh, she doesn't make a sound, does
she?

636
00:45:48,309 --> 00:45:50,647
MATT: Let's double-check this new ability that I'm
getting used to.

637
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:52,317
LAURA: I don't think she makes any noise.

638
00:45:52,317 --> 00:45:53,372
MARISHA: Can she tap?

639
00:45:53,372 --> 00:46:01,027
LAURA: But if she can cast through her, then I can
imagine she can make contact because she casts on touch.

640
00:46:01,027 --> 00:46:08,396
MATT: You create an illusory duplicate of
yourself. It is an illusion, it cannot make

641
00:46:08,396 --> 00:46:11,025
actually physical contact with anything.

642
00:46:11,025 --> 00:46:15,939
LAURA: Well, if she's behind one of the guards
then two of the other guards can see her.

643
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,994
MATT: Sure.

644
00:46:17,994 --> 00:46:20,154
SAM: We took a short rest on the thing?

645
00:46:20,154 --> 00:46:23,347
MATT: I'll say on the boat across the river,
sure.

646
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:26,010
SAM: If you want to hit dice it up.

647
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:30,544
TRAVIS: You can roll one hit die. He's rolling
commando. He don't want it.

648
00:46:30,544 --> 00:46:35,858
MATT: Anyway, you Invoke Duplicity and you appear
behind him.

649
00:46:35,858 --> 00:46:42,149
LAURA: Yeah. My duplicate is going to jump up and
down and start flailing her arms and then run down

650
00:46:42,149 --> 00:46:44,037
the alley around the building.

651
00:46:44,037 --> 00:46:45,530
MATT: Okay.

652
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:48,892
SAM: We have to kill these fucking guards, don't
we?

653
00:46:48,892 --> 00:46:50,210
MARISHA: No.

654
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:56,024
MATT: The guard sees something quickly dart into
the shadows and continues walking towards you.

655
00:46:56,024 --> 00:46:57,479
LAURA: Oh, come on!

656
00:46:57,479 --> 00:46:59,072
MARISHA: Just go with it, go with it.

657
00:46:59,072 --> 00:47:01,531
LAURA: Did you see that behind you?

658
00:47:01,531 --> 00:47:10,972
MATT: The guard approaches and goes, "It seems
that you have been out and about when you were

659
00:47:10,972 --> 00:47:13,531
"supposed to be within the inn."

660
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:15,736
MARISHA: Found it! The ring.

661
00:47:15,736 --> 00:47:17,738
LAURA: That's my ring. I dropped it out the
window.

662
00:47:17,738 --> 00:47:20,366
SAM: She calls it a shoe, it's a shoe ring.

663
00:47:20,366 --> 00:47:22,869
LAURA: I like to wear them on my toes.

664
00:47:22,869 --> 00:47:25,732
MATT: Three more guards have now approached from
the front of the building and they approach and

665
00:47:25,732 --> 00:47:28,775
begin pulling out manacles and chains and say,
"We're going to have to take you to the stockade."

666
00:47:28,775 --> 00:47:33,842
LAURA: Oh, please don't. Really, we just left the
building because we wanted to go--

667
00:47:33,842 --> 00:47:35,802
MATT: You're being locked up right now, as we
speak.

668
00:47:35,802 --> 00:47:38,350
LAURA: This is the stupidest thing!

669
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:40,099
MARISHA: So stupid!

670
00:47:40,099 --> 00:47:41,560
TALIESIN: Level two!

671
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,626
SAM: Do I have to go, too?

672
00:47:43,626 --> 00:47:45,178
MATT: Oh yeah.

673
00:47:45,178 --> 00:47:51,978
SAM: But I was just a bystander! I was walking
down here and I saw these two ruffians and

674
00:47:51,978 --> 00:47:53,929
I was going to go get help.

675
00:47:53,929 --> 00:47:55,081
MATT: Make a deception check.

676
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:57,683
LAURA: It's actually true, she wasn't with us.

677
00:47:57,683 --> 00:47:58,955
SAM: Zero.

678
00:47:58,955 --> 00:48:05,283
(laughter)

679
00:48:05,283 --> 00:48:07,481
TRAVIS: You rolled a zero?

680
00:48:07,481 --> 00:48:08,907
LIAM: Look at him!

681
00:48:08,907 --> 00:48:10,968
TRAVIS: What's your modifier, negative two?

682
00:48:10,968 --> 00:48:13,245
SAM: Three minus three is zero.

683
00:48:13,245 --> 00:48:15,849
MATT: That went into my nose.

684
00:48:15,849 --> 00:48:20,820
TRAVIS: Brave new world.

685
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:30,093
MATT: As you're telling him this, your mask goes
(creak). He goes, "Arrest that creature!"

686
00:48:30,093 --> 00:48:34,430
TALIESIN: We're going to die from bad paperwork.

687
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:36,477
MARISHA: Yeah, we really are.

688
00:48:36,477 --> 00:48:38,509
TALIESIN: Literally, we're going to die from bad
paperwork.

689
00:48:38,509 --> 00:48:41,971
MATT: You both are put in chains. You're put in
chains both arms and legs.

690
00:48:41,971 --> 00:48:43,656
LAURA: Oh, that's just mean.

691
00:48:43,656 --> 00:48:45,226
SAM: Racism!

692
00:48:45,226 --> 00:48:52,866
MATT: They bring you over to the stockade.
Mollymauk. I need you to make a stealth check with

693
00:48:52,866 --> 00:48:57,437
advantage.

694
00:48:57,437 --> 00:48:59,371
TALIESIN: 13.

695
00:48:59,371 --> 00:49:08,489
MATT: You guys slowly make your way through the
low grass over towards where the outside of the

696
00:49:08,489 --> 00:49:16,252
carnival is. As you approach, you can see there's
about five crownsguard that are making rounds

697
00:49:16,252 --> 00:49:20,459
around the outside. It looks like where previously
they had been keeping watch over the people that

698
00:49:20,459 --> 00:49:27,442
were there, since the murder of two of their own,
it has heightened the intensity of the watch. It

699
00:49:27,442 --> 00:49:32,505
looks like it's fairly well watched. You get the
sense, at a distance, that you would have a hard

700
00:49:32,505 --> 00:49:36,878
time getting in there. You can try and sneak her
in and sneak out, but it seems dangerous.

701
00:49:36,878 --> 00:49:44,573
TALIESIN: Oh, shite. Not even a good push to get
her underneath, just back into one of the tents,

702
00:49:44,573 --> 00:49:45,984
or no?

703
00:49:45,984 --> 00:49:47,669
MATT: You can try.

704
00:49:47,669 --> 00:49:54,215
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't know they're caught, do
I?

705
00:49:54,215 --> 00:49:56,498
MATT: No, you have no idea.

706
00:49:56,498 --> 00:49:57,964
MARISHA: Let's all get caught.

707
00:49:57,964 --> 00:50:00,504
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and wait for an
advantageous moment.

708
00:50:00,504 --> 00:50:08,019
MATT: Which I'm going to allow you to do. You stay
outside of the outskirts of the torchlight at the

709
00:50:08,019 --> 00:50:13,508
very front of the tent and the back of the tent.
The fire of the actual encampment has gone out

710
00:50:13,508 --> 00:50:21,078
because you don't see any other carnival members.
The sisters ran. They fled. You don't see any sign

711
00:50:21,078 --> 00:50:28,824
of Desmond or Ornna. Make one more stealth check,
for the two of you, with advantage because you still

712
00:50:28,824 --> 00:50:32,341
have the ability. You're at the cusp end of it
though.

713
00:50:32,341 --> 00:50:34,669
TALIESIN: Ooh. 22.

714
00:50:34,669 --> 00:50:41,728
MATT: You manage to pace yourself, just carefully
wait for the right moment, dart out of the grass

715
00:50:41,728 --> 00:50:46,100
having her under your arm and she's like, "What?
Why? What is going on?"

716
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:53,939
TALIESIN: You remember. Nothing happened. Find
Ornna. You didn't see me. You just hid and waited

717
00:50:53,939 --> 00:50:59,706
and you didn't know that anything was wrong. If
people ask, unless you hear from me, you don't

718
00:50:59,706 --> 00:51:01,399
know anything.

719
00:51:01,399 --> 00:51:07,400
MATT: "Okay." You slip her into the tent and back
out, none the wiser.

720
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,950
TALIESIN: I'm going to start heading back to the
inn.

721
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:14,537
MATT: Okay. You go back to the inn. You two.
You're just waiting?

722
00:51:14,537 --> 00:51:21,342
LIAM: No, I'm not waiting. I'm going to see Norda,
so I'll see you shortly. Be ready.

723
00:51:21,342 --> 00:51:22,741
TRAVIS: You will.

724
00:51:22,741 --> 00:51:29,394
MATT: Okay. You make your way to the stockade. As
you approach and make your way into the interior,

725
00:51:29,394 --> 00:51:33,960
the two crownsguard at the front say, "Hold. What's
your business?"

726
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:40,658
LIAM: Excuse me, and I lurch and prop myself up
against a wall and push back. Excuse me. I just

727
00:51:40,658 --> 00:51:43,355
had a very harrowing night.

728
00:51:43,355 --> 00:51:45,213
MATT: "Have you been drinking?"

729
00:51:45,213 --> 00:51:52,207
LIAM: You get me Norda this very minute and I will
tell you what has happened with this circus and in

730
00:51:52,207 --> 00:51:58,457
this town and don't keep me waiting another
minute. I'm bleeding out here. Arschloch.

731
00:51:58,457 --> 00:52:00,751
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

732
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:02,626
TALIESIN: Nice.

733
00:52:02,626 --> 00:52:05,969
LIAM: Oh, come on.

734
00:52:05,969 --> 00:52:07,343
MATT: Just keep it in the--

735
00:52:07,343 --> 00:52:17,107
LIAM: I wish I had gone with that because it was
great there but it's not great here. That is a nine!

736
00:52:17,107 --> 00:52:25,282
MATT: It is indeed. He sits there and glares down
at you for a second, your posturing, this

737
00:52:25,282 --> 00:52:33,419
filthy, scruffy man in a coat that wandered up out
of nowhere covered in a little bit of his own

738
00:52:33,419 --> 00:52:41,407
blood. He just looks down at you for a second,
"Sorry. She's done for the night."

739
00:52:41,407 --> 00:52:46,974
SAM: They keep regular hours here.

740
00:52:46,974 --> 00:52:53,376
LIAM: Excuse me. There are very good people being
held under house arrest in a tavern right now.

741
00:52:53,376 --> 00:52:59,144
They are innocent. I have evidence that I can show
her. This whole thing can be solved now.

742
00:52:59,144 --> 00:53:06,703
MATT: "This whole thing can be solved first thing
in the morning. I'll let you sleep it off. Have

743
00:53:06,703 --> 00:53:12,046
"some water. Come back when you're feeling a little
more yourself."

744
00:53:12,046 --> 00:53:17,791
SAM: Kill them all.

745
00:53:17,791 --> 00:53:20,774
TRAVIS: I draw back, and flames burst forth!

746
00:53:20,774 --> 00:53:30,907
LIAM: Okay. I look him in the eye. I will go away.
Get the message to her that the head of the circus

747
00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:34,334
frog is at the docks, waiting for her inspection.

748
00:53:34,334 --> 00:53:39,703
MATT: At this point, you hear a voice on the
inside, just like, "Good night, good night" and a

749
00:53:39,703 --> 00:53:50,827
cloaked figure exits the front doorway, roughly
about four and a half foot tall.

750
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:52,452
LIAM: I remember the height.

751
00:53:52,452 --> 00:53:58,324
MATT: Norda is off the clock and is currently
leaving for the evening to return to her home.

752
00:53:58,324 --> 00:54:07,557
LIAM: (shouting) There is a circus toad's remains
at the docks! I would like to put this town's

753
00:54:07,557 --> 00:54:14,417
fears to rest. I am looking for-- What's her name?
Yorda.

754
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:15,872
ALL: Norda.

755
00:54:15,872 --> 00:54:18,573
LIAM: Norda. Yorda's at the inn. Right?

756
00:54:18,573 --> 00:54:23,648
MATT: There's Norda and then Yorda because I like
to make it as confusing as possible.

757
00:54:23,648 --> 00:54:27,357
LIAM: Liam's memory is really spotty, but Caleb's
is rock-solid.

758
00:54:27,357 --> 00:54:30,702
MATT: It's funny. When you spell things on paper,
they seem so much different and when you say them

759
00:54:30,702 --> 00:54:39,786
out loud they're like, "Ah, they're very similar."
The figure stops and turns and you hear this

760
00:54:39,786 --> 00:54:48,314
audible (heavy sigh). The figure waddles over
towards you and pulls the hood back and it's

761
00:54:48,314 --> 00:54:53,218
Norda. "All right, what's this about a frog
head?"

762
00:54:53,218 --> 00:54:59,523
LIAM: Thank goodness. Thank you, gentlemen.
Forgive me, I can see that you're trying to get

763
00:54:59,523 --> 00:55:01,397
yourself home to bed.

764
00:55:01,397 --> 00:55:07,857
MATT: "That would be preferable, aye." You see
bags under her eyes. She's had a long day, her

765
00:55:07,857 --> 00:55:11,627
hair's a bit frazzled, and she looks like she's
waiting for you to finish.

766
00:55:11,627 --> 00:55:17,372
LIAM: You are very aware that there are people at the
Nestled Nook under house arrest by your order?

767
00:55:17,372 --> 00:55:24,081
They are innocent and I can prove it, and I would
like to end things as quickly as possible. I have

768
00:55:24,081 --> 00:55:29,621
killed one of the circus folk this evening.

769
00:55:29,621 --> 00:55:37,150
MATT: "Now this'll be real interesting." She looks
past you, and you follow her eyeline, and there

770
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:45,494
you hear the sound of chains as a handful of
crownsguard with Jester, Beau, and Nott, in

771
00:55:45,494 --> 00:55:48,852
manacles, approach from behind. "These ones,
you're talking about, right?"

772
00:55:48,852 --> 00:55:52,212
MARISHA: Help. Help. Help.

773
00:55:52,212 --> 00:55:56,618
(laughter)

774
00:55:56,618 --> 00:56:02,025
LIAM: Funny story. Yes, these are the people I was
talking about. Nothing has changed, however, and I

775
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:07,276
am only asking to take another ten minutes of your
time to walk to the dock. One of the performers

776
00:56:07,276 --> 00:56:16,163
has been killed this evening, and I have done it.
I staked out the circus because my friends were in

777
00:56:16,163 --> 00:56:20,853
trouble, and wrongly accused, and I knew this. So
I staked out the circus this evening, and watched

778
00:56:20,853 --> 00:56:30,092
as this toad thing left the grounds there. It did
this to me, and I, in a rage, followed it and

779
00:56:30,092 --> 00:56:35,456
destroyed it, and I will show you the remains of
my work. We'll put it to bed. I'm either a clown

780
00:56:35,456 --> 00:56:38,650
or I'm a toad-killer. Let's see what it is.

781
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:41,438
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

782
00:56:41,438 --> 00:56:44,375
LIAM: Come on, you fucker.

783
00:56:44,375 --> 00:56:46,542
LAURA: Oh, goddamn.

784
00:56:46,542 --> 00:56:49,071
LIAM: 11.

785
00:56:49,071 --> 00:57:03,612
MATT: She goes, (sighs) "Hold onto them for just a
moment." She walks back inside. A moment passes,

786
00:57:03,612 --> 00:57:07,352
and she returns with four other guards.

787
00:57:07,352 --> 00:57:11,601
LAURA: I keep doing this so I can make a jingling
sound with my chains.

788
00:57:11,601 --> 00:57:18,385
LIAM: You know, that's probably agitating the
issue. Let's go to the docks.

789
00:57:18,385 --> 00:57:29,806
MATT: She comes up. "All right. Drag them along
with us. Show us what this thing is, and if what

790
00:57:29,806 --> 00:57:33,834
"you say is not true, you'll join them. How's that
sound?"

791
00:57:33,834 --> 00:57:36,850
LIAM: I'm good with these terms. Follow me
please.

792
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:38,499
MATT: "All right."

793
00:57:38,499 --> 00:57:44,075
LAURA: You know, the only reason we were out of
the inn is because we were looking for you, Caleb.

794
00:57:44,075 --> 00:57:46,158
We didn't know where you went.

795
00:57:46,158 --> 00:57:52,135
LIAM: I am not going to answer her. I'm just
walking very firmly, with purpose, to the docks.

796
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:56,799
MATT: It has been close to an hour at this point.

797
00:57:56,799 --> 00:58:04,513
TRAVIS: If I can clock that, I would like to leave
the head, move off into the shadows, and assume my

798
00:58:04,513 --> 00:58:07,362
older man form.

799
00:58:07,362 --> 00:58:10,654
MATT: Using your second slot.

800
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:12,929
TRAVIS: No, I can just drop--

801
00:58:12,929 --> 00:58:15,654
MATT: Oh no, you can do this whenever, that's
right.

802
00:58:15,654 --> 00:58:20,865
TRAVIS: I'll drop the crownsguard, and make the
old man and sit so I can keep an eye on it, but

803
00:58:20,865 --> 00:58:21,952
away from it.

804
00:58:21,952 --> 00:58:26,492
MATT: Eventually, you guys are led up to the
docks, where you guide them.

805
00:58:26,492 --> 00:58:31,828
LIAM: Moment of confusion-- here it is, right
here, where I left it. Nobody has tampered with

806
00:58:31,828 --> 00:58:38,191
it. I turn around and I pull back my clothing and
show a huge slash across my body, and say: You see

807
00:58:38,191 --> 00:58:41,728
this? It was done by this thing. (whoosh)

808
00:58:41,728 --> 00:58:47,789
MATT: As soon as you pull back and reveal the
face, its jaw is relaxed now, its muscles have sat

809
00:58:47,789 --> 00:58:55,437
now that it's been left in the dock, and it's
pooled at its base. This old pumpkin look. Its

810
00:58:55,437 --> 00:59:00,418
tongue's lolling out and unraveled on the ground,
what remained within its salivary glands has

811
00:59:00,418 --> 00:59:05,544
soaked the remaining wood around its base. One of
the eyes has rolled back, but it's a horrible

812
00:59:05,544 --> 00:59:10,558
display. The guards take a step back immediately
at the reveal, and Norda immediately gets

813
00:59:10,558 --> 00:59:16,100
interested, gets close, takes a look at it, and
begins prodding a bit with her finger.

814
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:20,113
LIAM: It is as bad as it looks, and if you have
any holy people in this city, they will confirm

815
00:59:20,113 --> 00:59:25,895
that this thing is fiendish.

816
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:33,525
MATT: (sighs) "You say it's a fiend? Because what
this looks like is you just murdered one of our

817
00:59:33,525 --> 00:59:45,037
"possible witnesses and/or other members of this
investigation, so I'm hoping this is a fiend. I

818
00:59:45,037 --> 00:59:46,438
"don't know fiends."

819
00:59:46,438 --> 00:59:51,948
LIAM: I hope you don't believe that I slashed open
my own body and then went to the police.

820
00:59:51,948 --> 00:59:59,232
MATT: "Honey, I've been doing this for a long
time. I've seen stranger. Hold on just a second."

821
00:59:59,232 --> 01:00:07,363
She calls one of the guards over, whispers to him
for a second. He rushes off. "Just so happens we have

822
01:00:07,363 --> 01:00:12,319
"someone in town who might be able to confirm this
for us, might help your case."

823
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:13,778
LAURA: Who is it?

824
01:00:13,778 --> 01:00:16,237
MATT: "Oh, they will be here shortly."

825
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:18,223
LIAM: I sit down on a crate and I stop talking.

826
01:00:18,223 --> 01:00:23,007
MATT: Okay, and this awkward period of time with
the guards all just standing there, holding you

827
01:00:23,007 --> 01:00:27,761
as you wait patiently. Some of them are tapping
their fingers. You start rattling your chains and

828
01:00:27,761 --> 01:00:34,853
two guards pull the chains taut so you can't do it
anymore. Mollymauk, as you begin to make your way

829
01:00:34,853 --> 01:00:40,622
back into town, because you're making your way
through the dock district along the lakeside and

830
01:00:40,622 --> 01:00:44,280
you look up ahead, and you can see there's a
couple of torches being held by crownsguard right

831
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:49,509
where the head was left, and you can see Caleb,
and then three of your allies in chains.

832
01:00:49,509 --> 01:01:00,687
TALIESIN: Hmm. (sighs)

833
01:01:00,687 --> 01:01:02,656
LAURA: Oh no! What are you going to do?

834
01:01:02,656 --> 01:01:04,388
TALIESIN: I'm going to get a little closer.

835
01:01:04,388 --> 01:01:07,519
MATT: All right, make a stealth check, please. You
do not have advantage anymore, that has passed.

836
01:01:07,519 --> 01:01:09,107
It's been more than a hour.

837
01:01:09,107 --> 01:01:12,625
TALIESIN: Just to take a look at what is actually
going on.

838
01:01:12,625 --> 01:01:14,053
LAURA: Not to get too close.

839
01:01:14,053 --> 01:01:15,612
TALIESIN: Not too close.

840
01:01:15,612 --> 01:01:18,045
MATT: Yeah, it's not a high DC.

841
01:01:18,045 --> 01:01:19,601
TALIESIN: 19!

842
01:01:19,601 --> 01:01:24,931
MATT: You get a little closer, you are still maybe
a good 100 feet or so away from them, keeping to

843
01:01:25,079 --> 01:01:31,685
the shadows along a building, keeping low.
Thankfully it's nighttime, it's pushing midnight

844
01:01:31,685 --> 01:01:35,637
at this point. Because you're ostentatiously
dressed, but there isn't a lot of light in your

845
01:01:35,637 --> 01:01:42,816
colors. As far as you know right now, no one can
see you, you're too far away to hear much, but you

846
01:01:42,816 --> 01:01:43,936
can keep an eye on them.

847
01:01:50,976 --> 01:01:54,471
TALIESIN: Oh, what's the play? What's the play?

848
01:01:57,653 --> 01:02:05,302
Ah! I'm going to--
Yeah, fuck it. I'm going to walk up.

849
01:02:05,302 --> 01:02:07,647
MATT: All right.

850
01:02:07,647 --> 01:02:15,137
TALIESIN: With briskly. There I find you!
I've been looking everywhere.

851
01:02:15,137 --> 01:02:18,137
You're not supposed to leave 
the bloody inn you-- oh.

852
01:02:18,137 --> 01:02:21,956
(sighs) They're already in trouble, apparently.

853
01:02:25,273 --> 01:02:33,416
MATT: "I love when they do this! Chain him up."
You are shackled as well.

854
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:37,644
TALIESIN: All right. Less questions to answer.

855
01:02:37,644 --> 01:02:44,061
MATT: At this point, Norda is starting to smile a
bit. She's like "Man, if we could have more

856
01:02:44,061 --> 01:02:49,353
criminals like you lot, my job would be far
easier. I would get home a lot earlier."

857
01:02:49,353 --> 01:02:55,358
SAM: We're not criminals! We're not! Me and Caleb
were just travelling ever since we broke out of that--

858
01:02:59,874 --> 01:03:01,212
Nothing!

859
01:03:01,545 --> 01:03:03,117
TALIESIN: Dance number.

860
01:03:03,117 --> 01:03:07,880
LIAM: No, it's good that you try so hard to
protect the rights of giant frog creatures. I'm

861
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,330
very impressed.

862
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:12,303
LAURA: Fiend creatures specifically.

863
01:03:12,303 --> 01:03:15,959
MATT: At this point the guard that had left
earlier, who has been gone for about 15 to 20

864
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:20,063
minutes or so, comes back with a brisk jog.
There's another figure walking up behind him, also

865
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:29,294
jogging. You can see light gray hood and cloak
around and as the figure approaches into the torch

866
01:03:29,294 --> 01:03:36,781
light, pulls back the hood, and you see this long
shoulder length curled blond hair. A very very

867
01:03:36,781 --> 01:03:48,459
delicate looking elven male, who approaches. "I
believe I've been summoned, Norda?" "Yes sorry,

868
01:03:48,459 --> 01:03:58,037
this is Archivist Zeenoth. He's been in town for a
few days and he comes from the library that knows

869
01:03:58,037 --> 01:04:06,321
a lot about a lot of things. I hope that he can
help us in this. Zeenoth, they're calling this

870
01:04:06,321 --> 01:04:15,042
thing a fiend. What do you know about this?" He
steps closer, kneels down next to the head.

871
01:04:15,042 --> 01:04:16,982
TALIESIN: Xhorhas.

872
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:17,868
MATT: Hmm?

873
01:04:17,868 --> 01:04:20,885
TALIESIN: I just whisper Xhorhas.

874
01:04:20,885 --> 01:04:28,698
MATT: "Yes, these creatures do frequent Xhorhas."
He gives some look over, pulls a small book out of

875
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:36,291
his side pouch. Begins to thumb through it,
compares a few things. "I'm not a specialist,

876
01:04:36,291 --> 01:04:48,608
unfortunately. This creature is very much a very
dangerous entity from the far east. I'm surprised

877
01:04:48,608 --> 01:04:57,278
it made it this far into civilization before being
destroyed. It's a good thing it has been." He now

878
01:04:57,278 --> 01:05:02,537
gets to look at everyone, over the crew and goes,
"Are you the ones who slew it?"

879
01:05:02,813 --> 01:05:06,465
LAURA: Oh well technically it was Caleb,
technically.

880
01:05:06,465 --> 01:05:08,740
LIAM: Just me.

881
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:13,033
MATT: As the figure looks over and stops on Beau
and kind of smiles.

882
01:05:13,033 --> 01:05:16,716
SAM: What's going on over there?

883
01:05:16,716 --> 01:05:20,786
MARISHA: Oh sorry, I just have back issues. I'm
just stretching.

884
01:05:20,786 --> 01:05:30,562
LIAM: Yes it was difficult, but I prevailed in the
end. The city is safe. What library was that that

885
01:05:30,562 --> 01:05:32,570
you mentioned?

886
01:05:32,570 --> 01:05:36,160
MATT: "Oh I'm an archivist. I'm the archivist of
the Cobalt Soul."

887
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,832
LIAM: Here in town?

888
01:05:38,832 --> 01:05:43,623
MATT: "No, I'm from Zadash. I'm a bit out of my
depth at the moment."

889
01:05:43,645 --> 01:05:46,597
LAURA: What brings you this far?

890
01:05:46,597 --> 01:05:55,472
MATT: "Well, I have business." At this point Norda
goes, "All right you know what? This is some

891
01:05:55,472 --> 01:06:00,589
serious bullshite. We're all just chilling here at
the docks, we have confirmed that's a fiend."

892
01:06:00,741 --> 01:06:02,770
LAURA: The nergaliid!

893
01:06:02,770 --> 01:06:12,484
MATT: "A nergaliid! Bring them back to the
stockade. Let's have a trial." They begin to pull

894
01:06:12,599 --> 01:06:17,178
you guys back to the stockade. Two of the guards
grab the nergaliid head and they begin dragging it

895
01:06:17,178 --> 01:06:19,517
along, and you guys are all being pulled.

896
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:25,106
LIAM: Oh sorry, one last thing, Watchmaster. I
pull out the book that I read about the nergaliid.

897
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:31,880
Here this is a gift, for you. This is folklore.
You will find I have marked a page in there. It

898
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:34,210
will describe this thing.

899
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:37,173
MATT: As you guys are walking, she thumbs through
and finds the page, begins to read, passes it to

900
01:06:37,173 --> 01:06:43,181
the archivist. He begins to read it. He passes it
back. You guys all make your way into the

901
01:06:43,181 --> 01:06:48,058
stockade. You're not brought to her chambers,
you're brought to a much larger room. This room

902
01:06:48,058 --> 01:06:56,809
has much more of a stark, barren, stone interior.
There are benches built. There is a central kind

903
01:06:56,809 --> 01:07:02,700
of a pit. There's about four or five steps down
into this pit. Then above that is a desk where

904
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:09,755
Norda takes as the law master. As you step in you
realize, oh this is a room of judgement. What are

905
01:07:09,755 --> 01:07:11,136
you doing?

906
01:07:11,136 --> 01:07:15,820
TRAVIS: I would like to try, once they start
making their way back to that facility, to quickly

907
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:23,453
make my way to the inn, if I can as the old man,
enter, make my way into the restroom, drop my

908
01:07:23,639 --> 01:07:29,918
disguise, come back out as Fjord. Oh the water
closet, what have you.

909
01:07:29,918 --> 01:07:31,953
MATT: There is a shared water closet.

910
01:07:31,953 --> 01:07:33,281
LIAM: It's just a pot.

911
01:07:33,281 --> 01:07:37,859
TRAVIS: Yeah, the room with the pot in it. Then
make my way back to the front door, stick my head

912
01:07:37,859 --> 01:07:39,684
out where the guards are.

913
01:07:39,684 --> 01:07:42,937
MATT: Yeah, there's two guards still posted there.
Most of them have already left because they're

914
01:07:42,937 --> 01:07:44,572
carting off the rest of your friends.

915
01:07:44,572 --> 01:07:49,185
TRAVIS: Please, I can't seem to find any of my
comrades. Have you seen where they have gone?

916
01:07:49,185 --> 01:07:53,075
MATT: They look at each other. "Yeah, they've been
arrested."

917
01:07:53,075 --> 01:08:01,513
TRAVIS: I was afraid as much. Could I make my way
down to where they are being held? I would like to

918
01:08:01,513 --> 01:08:04,390
be present, if it would be prudent.

919
01:08:09,310 --> 01:08:17,270
MATT: "You leave our watch, we cut you." They both
flank you side to side and push you ahead a little

920
01:08:17,416 --> 01:08:21,086
bit. They are glued to your right and left.

921
01:08:21,086 --> 01:08:22,631
TRAVIS: Very kind of you.

922
01:08:22,631 --> 01:08:27,984
MATT: They lead you to the stockade. As you guys
are brought into this chamber, Norda sets up.

923
01:08:27,984 --> 01:08:31,167
SAM: Who is going to go get the little girl?

924
01:08:33,917 --> 01:08:39,930
LIAM: You're the little girl here. You're
confused. It's been a night.

925
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:50,929
MATT: Norda, up there at the top, takes her cloak
off, puts on her ceremonial armor bits. There's a

926
01:08:50,929 --> 01:08:56,759
whole element to the presentation of this. You can
see her tiredly putting them on. Sets her hands on

927
01:08:56,759 --> 01:09:05,210
the top, "I would like you to present what
evidence you have to absolve you of these charges

928
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:10,387
against you and then based on what you present,
I'll decide whether or not you're innocent or

929
01:09:10,387 --> 01:09:20,125
guilty or require further investigation. Who would
like to present evidence first? You! You brought

930
01:09:20,125 --> 01:09:26,625
the head of a creature! You're not in chains.
We'll start with you." They drag the creature's

931
01:09:26,625 --> 01:09:33,314
head forward. She takes the book from the
archivist. "And speaking with Zeenoth here, it

932
01:09:33,314 --> 01:09:39,847
appears what you said is true. This creature is a
dangerous, terrible fiend. And looking at it's

933
01:09:39,847 --> 01:09:49,318
apparent ability to feast on the essence of
creatures, this explains both the transformation

934
01:09:49,318 --> 01:10:01,974
of the old man. This also explains destruction of
our two guards, who were recently discovered. Rest

935
01:10:01,974 --> 01:10:10,526
their soul. So, that explains that. Convince me as
to why you were not working with this entity,

936
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:18,228
especially those of the carnival." She snaps her
finger again and you watch as Gustav and Bosun are

937
01:10:18,228 --> 01:10:26,686
brought into the chamber, as well as a third
figure who you see step out of the shadows. Her

938
01:10:26,686 --> 01:10:35,823
hair dark and fading to white, last seen fleeing
into the distant fields, you see, in chains as

939
01:10:35,823 --> 01:10:39,943
well, Yasha being pulled into the courtroom.

940
01:10:39,943 --> 01:10:43,400
(cheering)

941
01:10:44,444 --> 01:10:47,045
TRAVIS: Showing up just to get arrested!

942
01:10:47,045 --> 01:10:50,240
MARISHA: Welcome to the club!

943
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:54,017
LIAM: (singing) Breaking the law, breaking the
law!

944
01:10:54,017 --> 01:10:56,674
TALIESIN: Lot of help you were!

945
01:10:56,674 --> 01:10:58,342
MARISHA: Welcome to the chain gang.

946
01:10:58,342 --> 01:11:00,119
ASHLEY: Hey. Yeah.

947
01:11:00,119 --> 01:11:02,142
MATT: "That one was caught fleeing from the
scene."

948
01:11:02,142 --> 01:11:08,503
ASHLEY: No, that's completely a misunderstanding
of things. That's not what happened.

949
01:11:08,503 --> 01:11:14,771
MATT: "I'm certain. You have a trustworthy face.
What's the next bit of evidence you want to

950
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:16,947
present, please? Anyone?"

951
01:11:16,947 --> 01:11:20,135
LIAM: Well, first a question. Are you familiar
with Occam's Razor?

952
01:11:20,135 --> 01:11:21,974
MATT: "What?"

953
01:11:21,974 --> 01:11:28,869
LIAM: I figured. Okay. That one works for the
circus. Do I look like I work for the circus?

954
01:11:28,869 --> 01:11:33,734
MATT: "Strangely, not well dressed enough."

955
01:11:33,734 --> 01:11:38,627
LIAM: No. I'm a dirty hobo and I reek like
yesterday's garbage.

956
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:42,878
MATT: "I wasn't going to go that far, but I'll
admiss it."

957
01:11:42,878 --> 01:11:52,319
LIAM: Yeah. This one, does he look like a circus
performer? Is he filthy like me?

958
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:54,927
LAURA: He's not here.

959
01:11:54,927 --> 01:11:58,161
MATT: "Which one?" Fjord has not arrived yet.

960
01:11:58,161 --> 01:12:00,938
LIAM: But he's right here! Look, I can touch him.

961
01:12:00,938 --> 01:12:06,166
MATT: We'll say for the purposes of that, as you
say that and reveal your hand, Fjord enters

962
01:12:06,166 --> 01:12:09,701
through the door like it was a planned arrival.

963
01:12:09,878 --> 01:12:12,673
SAM: Weirdly, he's dripping wet.

964
01:12:12,673 --> 01:12:14,641
TRAVIS: Baby oil.

965
01:12:14,641 --> 01:12:20,828
LIAM: The sardonic one, right? With the
shit-eating grin. Does she look like she works for

966
01:12:20,828 --> 01:12:22,711
the circus?

967
01:12:22,711 --> 01:12:27,104
MATT: "I don't know what she works for, but I
don't trust her."

968
01:12:27,104 --> 01:12:29,880
MARISHA: That's smart.

969
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:40,345
LIAM: I am injured within a centimeter of my life.
This one is a nincompoop.

970
01:12:40,821 --> 01:12:43,927
LAURA: Wait, which one were you pointing at?

971
01:12:43,927 --> 01:12:47,795
LIAM: That's you. I pull the mask away. This is my
good friend. She's a goblin.

972
01:12:47,795 --> 01:12:50,144
SAM: A little halfling girl!

973
01:12:50,144 --> 01:12:53,845
MATT: At this point, you watch her pull back.

974
01:12:53,845 --> 01:12:59,762
LIAM: I step in front of her. She is my friend and
colleague and you will not lay a hand on her while

975
01:12:59,762 --> 01:13:01,753
I am standing here.

976
01:13:01,753 --> 01:13:03,441
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

977
01:13:03,441 --> 01:13:05,520
LIAM: Fucking right I will.

978
01:13:07,444 --> 01:13:13,317
That is an 11.
(chanting) Level two!

979
01:13:13,317 --> 01:13:17,074
MARISHA: (chanting) Shitty dice!

980
01:13:17,074 --> 01:13:22,492
MATT: Her eyes are chained onto this goblin.

981
01:13:22,492 --> 01:13:30,174
LIAM: She's looking into my chest because Nott is
behind me. I'm sorry, I'm confused why you're

982
01:13:30,174 --> 01:13:37,061
going to such lengths to defend the rights of this
large, oversized frog skull.

983
01:13:37,061 --> 01:13:43,372
MATT: "I defend no rights of this creature! I've
been in this office long enough to know that there

984
01:13:43,372 --> 01:13:49,066
aren't usually solo workers on something like
this. I know these folk. They all protect each

985
01:13:49,066 --> 01:13:54,222
other. Who's to say this wasn't their whole
reasoning for coming anyway, and something went

986
01:13:54,222 --> 01:13:56,780
wrong, and they're letting him take the fall?"

987
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:59,988
LIAM: There's a big conspiracy to make undead
crownsguard here in the city?

988
01:13:59,988 --> 01:14:04,884
MATT: "I don't fucking know! Don't tell me how I
do my business! Sit the fuck down! Who's next?"

989
01:14:04,884 --> 01:14:11,380
TALIESIN: You're right. We do protect our own.
That's absolutely true.

990
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:16,874
MATT: "Let him up." They loosen the chains and you
get to stand and approach a bit.

991
01:14:16,874 --> 01:14:23,552
TALIESIN: It's a common tactic. It's a good way to
make your way through this world. Normally it

992
01:14:23,552 --> 01:14:34,859
works. We assumed, the circus, anyway, that we
were being framed. We were protecting our own. Is

993
01:14:34,859 --> 01:14:37,957
the head in here?

994
01:14:37,957 --> 01:14:39,607
LAURA: Yes.

995
01:14:39,607 --> 01:14:46,014
TALIESIN: This one showed his true colors, and
then we took care of it. I'm going to throw one of

996
01:14:46,014 --> 01:14:50,057
my swords down on the ground that is filthy with
its blood.

997
01:14:50,057 --> 01:14:55,816
MATT: "All right. Why did this one run?"

998
01:14:59,816 --> 01:15:00,948
ASHLEY: Well--

999
01:15:02,388 --> 01:15:04,090
SAM: (high-pitched) I mean--

1000
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:19,439
ASHLEY: I feel like I didn't need to be in there
anymore. You know. I don't-- ugh.

1001
01:15:19,439 --> 01:15:22,119
MATT: I would like you both to make persuasion
checks.

1002
01:15:22,119 --> 01:15:24,533
ASHLEY: I feel like--

1003
01:15:28,543 --> 01:15:30,399
TALIESIN: Oh, shit. 12.

1004
01:15:32,395 --> 01:15:34,787
ASHLEY: 11.

1005
01:15:34,787 --> 01:15:40,185
TALIESIN: We needed someone on the outside. We
knew we were innocent. We knew you didn't think

1006
01:15:40,185 --> 01:15:46,618
so. We just assumed you were going to have us all
executed and we didn't do anything. What would you

1007
01:15:46,618 --> 01:15:48,276
have done?

1008
01:15:48,276 --> 01:15:51,076
MATT: "Is that goblin pissing in my court?"

1009
01:15:51,076 --> 01:15:53,294
(laughter)

1010
01:15:53,294 --> 01:15:56,967
SAM: I'm sorry! I'm really nervous!

1011
01:15:56,967 --> 01:16:00,789
TALIESIN: In his defense, it's a wonderful
vintage. Her defense.

1012
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:07,878
SAM: I'm very nervous. I'm sorry, it's just your
guards shackled both my wrists and my ankles and I

1013
01:16:07,878 --> 01:16:12,082
can't move to get into a good position.

1014
01:16:12,082 --> 01:16:16,180
LIAM: You know, when she's nervous she aerates her
bladder, all right?

1015
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:23,612
SAM: Look, I have some evidence to submit. Look at
my hands and also the hands of Jester. We're

1016
01:16:23,612 --> 01:16:30,225
covered in the thing's blood. We were there too.
We helped the killing of the creature.

1017
01:16:30,225 --> 01:16:38,943
MATT: The dwarf woman, Norda, leans forward and
looks you dead in the eyes. "I've known friends I

1018
01:16:38,943 --> 01:16:51,488
grew up with who were carved down by your kin.
Convince me why I shouldn't hang you tomorrow."

1019
01:16:51,488 --> 01:17:01,475
SAM: I'm sorry for your loss. Where are your
people from?

1020
01:17:01,475 --> 01:17:03,109
MATT: "Grimgolir."

1021
01:17:03,109 --> 01:17:11,214
SAM: That's not where my clan's from. I had
nothing to do with it. My clan operates far, far

1022
01:17:11,214 --> 01:17:12,490
away and--

1023
01:17:12,490 --> 01:17:15,614
MATT: "Where does your clan operate from?"

1024
01:17:18,624 --> 01:17:24,455
SAM: I'm looking on the map. Near the Felderwin
Tillage.

1025
01:17:25,551 --> 01:17:30,970
MATT: "That's not too far. Maybe we'll send some
folks to pay a visit to your clan."

1026
01:17:30,970 --> 01:17:38,799
SAM: You can. Feel free. I'll even tell you where
they are. I'm no longer associated with them and I

1027
01:17:38,799 --> 01:17:42,479
can help you hunt them down if you'd like.

1028
01:17:42,479 --> 01:17:43,974
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1029
01:17:43,974 --> 01:17:45,915
MARISHA: Wow.

1030
01:17:46,406 --> 01:17:48,128
LAURA: What is it?

1031
01:17:48,128 --> 01:17:50,488
SAM: One.

1032
01:17:51,804 --> 01:17:56,414
LAURA: No, but you didn't roll a one. He rolled a
four.

1033
01:17:56,414 --> 01:18:00,121
SAM: It's not a natural one.

1034
01:18:00,121 --> 01:18:02,090
LAURA and TALIESIN: Not a natural one.

1035
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:03,422
LIAM: Still sucks.

1036
01:18:03,422 --> 01:18:07,192
MATT: (sigh)

1037
01:18:07,192 --> 01:18:09,587
LAURA: God, why are we rolling so bad?

1038
01:18:09,587 --> 01:18:28,585
MATT: She leans back. "I want to sleep. I think
you're telling the truth. Most of you. Archivist,

1039
01:18:28,585 --> 01:18:33,158
does this resonate with you as well? Does this
check out, lore-wise? I don't know what the fuck

1040
01:18:33,158 --> 01:18:41,087
you do." The Archivist is like, "I believe based
on what they've stated, at least it's consistent

1041
01:18:41,087 --> 01:18:50,553
though I'm a bit confused as to the demeanor of
the goblin. It's not unheard of to have goblin kin

1042
01:18:50,553 --> 01:18:55,484
turn against their own. There have been a number
of historic individuals of various monstrous races

1043
01:18:55,484 --> 01:18:58,886
who have been beneficial members of society."

1044
01:18:58,886 --> 01:19:02,157
LIAM: I invite Nott up to my piggy-back position
on my shoulders.

1045
01:19:02,157 --> 01:19:03,945
LAURA: You can't, she's chained up.

1046
01:19:03,945 --> 01:19:06,624
LIAM: I scoop her up.

1047
01:19:06,624 --> 01:19:10,420
SAM: This is even more awkward. Just put me back
down. Put me back down.

1048
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:13,484
LIAM: Just let it happen.

1049
01:19:13,484 --> 01:19:20,412
SAM: No! The chains are pulling me one way and
you're pulling me the other way. Just come down to

1050
01:19:20,412 --> 01:19:23,292
my level! Come down here!

1051
01:19:27,342 --> 01:19:34,447
MATT: "Bring the two others forward." They bring
forward Gustav and Bosun. "This is your circus,

1052
01:19:34,497 --> 01:19:42,480
right?" He goes, "It is my circus and I take full
responsibility for what's happened. Sincerely.

1053
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:48,542
They have done nothing wrong. They are completely
innocent. I brought this creature into our fold

1054
01:19:48,542 --> 01:19:56,062
and that is on me. Whatever judgement you have,
bring onto my head, not theirs. Please. I implore

1055
01:19:56,062 --> 01:20:10,569
you." "Fine. I'll consider the investigation
closed. You're all freed of charges against you.

1056
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:16,661
Including the goblin."

1057
01:20:16,791 --> 01:20:20,739
SAM: Oh! Thank you! I would kiss you if I could.

1058
01:20:20,739 --> 01:20:36,145
MATT: "I would not recommend trying. Okay. Gustav,
what's-- I can't read your last name. You've been

1059
01:20:36,145 --> 01:20:42,104
given quite a debt for Trostenwald so you shall
remain here until you've worked off the debt to

1060
01:20:42,104 --> 01:20:56,895
the city. To the number of 2,645 gold pieces. To
make up for the deaths of our two crownsguard, of

1061
01:20:56,895 --> 01:21:05,298
the two civilians who have died, and the general
cost of this entire investigation. We'll consider

1062
01:21:05,489 --> 01:21:15,231
what your work is to the city tomorrow. However,
the rest of you: you're free to go. I'm going to

1063
01:21:15,231 --> 01:21:17,839
go get myself some sleep."

1064
01:21:17,839 --> 01:21:20,925
LIAM: Can I have my book back, please?

1065
01:21:20,925 --> 01:21:29,180
MATT: Takes her armor off. "(sigh) All right. I'm
going to get a drink." She puts her cloak on and

1066
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:36,087
then hops off. With the imposing sight of her on
top of a large pedestal and desk, she hops down to

1067
01:21:36,087 --> 01:21:39,585
her natural dwarven height and it's almost
adorable to watch her just skitter the hell out of

1068
01:21:39,585 --> 01:21:41,966
there. She's done.

1069
01:21:41,966 --> 01:21:44,065
LAURA: Where are you getting a drink at?

1070
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:45,461
MATT: There's no response.

1071
01:21:45,461 --> 01:21:47,859
LAURA: Do you want company?

1072
01:21:47,859 --> 01:21:49,875
TRAVIS: I just turn to the nearest crownsguard
and--

1073
01:21:49,875 --> 01:22:04,051
MATT: The chains are removed. They free everybody,
including Gustav, but two guards are assigned to

1074
01:22:04,051 --> 01:22:07,334
him to keep an eye over him.

1075
01:22:07,334 --> 01:22:12,309
MARISHA: As soon as Beau gets out of her chains, I
grab my stuff and I leave.

1076
01:22:12,309 --> 01:22:23,071
MATT: Okay. As you are exiting the stockade, in
the archway of the doors right outside, you see

1077
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:30,076
another figure standing hood up-- like a short
hood with a mantle that stops about midway. Bare

1078
01:22:30,076 --> 01:22:36,948
arms and dark skin, baggy gray pants and is there,
waiting.

1079
01:22:36,948 --> 01:22:39,011
MARISHA: What's the mantle?

1080
01:22:39,011 --> 01:22:43,732
MATT: You don't recognize any details about it.
You see a cloaked figure there, waiting, looking

1081
01:22:43,732 --> 01:22:45,364
right at you.

1082
01:22:45,364 --> 01:22:47,331
MARISHA: Is he blocking the doorway?

1083
01:22:47,331 --> 01:22:49,915
MATT: Is just beyond the doorway. It's not
blocked.

1084
01:22:49,915 --> 01:22:52,410
MARISHA: Is there another way out?

1085
01:22:52,410 --> 01:22:57,925
MATT: I mean, you can exit. They're just on the
other side of the door. Every other way in, you

1086
01:22:57,925 --> 01:23:01,290
don't know the stockade well and all of it just
leads further into the stockade. There are other

1087
01:23:01,290 --> 01:23:03,293
crownsguard inside.

1088
01:23:03,293 --> 01:23:08,520
MARISHA: Okay, I'm just going to try and just bolt
through.

1089
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:11,345
MATT: You're just going to bolt? Full run?

1090
01:23:11,345 --> 01:23:14,573
MARISHA: Not run, just you know, Irish goodbye.

1091
01:23:14,573 --> 01:23:21,159
MATT: Okay. All right. As you briskly exit and
turn to the left, the figure intervenes and side

1092
01:23:21,159 --> 01:23:24,160
steps right in front of you.

1093
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:26,840
MARISHA: Do I recognize him?

1094
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:36,366
MATT: No. You don't see much of the face. The hood
is up and a little bit of the moonlight is coming,

1095
01:23:36,366 --> 01:23:47,127
you can see the edge of features. The body is
muscular, but thin. Looks not terribly masculine

1096
01:23:47,127 --> 01:23:54,150
or feminine, but it looks able and it moved at a
very quick speed to intercept your positioning.

1097
01:23:57,350 --> 01:24:01,477
MARISHA: I just go: Oh, fuck! Turn around and walk
back in.

1098
01:24:02,763 --> 01:24:04,783
MATT: Okay.

1099
01:24:04,783 --> 01:24:08,167
MARISHA: I'll join everyone else. I flick off the
guy on my way back in.

1100
01:24:08,167 --> 01:24:17,144
MATT: Okay. As you guys are being escorted out of the
stockade, Beau comes back in and joins you.

1101
01:24:17,144 --> 01:24:18,705
LAURA: I thought you left.

1102
01:24:18,705 --> 01:24:19,911
MARISHA: Just had to pee.

1103
01:24:19,911 --> 01:24:20,900
LAURA: Oh.

1104
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:22,037
TALIESIN: Shame.

1105
01:24:22,037 --> 01:24:24,783
LAURA: Hey, you guys, we're town heroes! What's it
feel like?

1106
01:24:24,783 --> 01:24:28,204
MARISHA and LAURA: Yeah!

1107
01:24:28,204 --> 01:24:30,358
LAURA: Yasha, it's very good to see you again.

1108
01:24:30,358 --> 01:24:32,110
ASHLEY: It's good to see you guys, too.

1109
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:34,968
SAM: Where did you go? Were you on the lam for a
long time?

1110
01:24:34,968 --> 01:24:49,137
ASHLEY: I have a little bit of a problem with
authority and I didn't want to be caught in a

1111
01:24:49,137 --> 01:24:52,166
small and confined space and then that ended up
happening.

1112
01:24:52,166 --> 01:24:54,303
LAURA: How long have you been in there?

1113
01:24:54,303 --> 01:25:12,563
ASHLEY: Immediately after I ran away. They sent
out horses. I'm not that fast, but I did fuck up a

1114
01:25:12,563 --> 01:25:15,511
few of the guards. "By accident. "

1115
01:25:15,511 --> 01:25:20,829
MATT: As you say that, you hear a couple (clears
throat) and two of the crownsguard visibly bruised

1116
01:25:20,829 --> 01:25:27,321
that are escorting you guys out into the night air
before they eventually leave you to your own devices.

1117
01:25:27,321 --> 01:25:32,741
TRAVIS: Molly, what do you think this means for
the carnival?

1118
01:25:32,741 --> 01:25:36,059
TALIESIN: I don't know. That is a question.

1119
01:25:36,059 --> 01:25:39,959
LAURA: I mean, if Gustav has to stay here then
who's going to run it?

1120
01:25:39,959 --> 01:25:43,989
MARISHA: That's a lot of gold. That's like a life
sentence worth of gold.

1121
01:25:43,989 --> 01:25:45,693
LAURA: Well, I mean--

1122
01:25:45,693 --> 01:25:47,287
TALIESIN: Gold comes, gold goes.

1123
01:25:47,287 --> 01:25:49,712
LIAM: How much do you think the circus has?

1124
01:25:49,712 --> 01:25:55,636
TALIESIN: I don't know how much the circus has and,
honestly, I think Ornna would lie about it if we asked.

1125
01:25:55,636 --> 01:26:02,713
MATT: The crownsguard have pulled away and now
it's just you guys and Bosun and Gustav now, out

1126
01:26:02,713 --> 01:26:16,716
in the air and Gustav is rubbing his wrists.
"Well, thank you everyone for helping. That could

1127
01:26:16,716 --> 01:26:23,787
"have been a lot worse. And, you know, it's fine. I
know it's a lot of money, but shouldn't take me

1128
01:26:23,787 --> 01:26:31,728
"more than a few years. It's a nice town!
Trostenwald is a nice town!"

1129
01:26:31,728 --> 01:26:33,722
TRAVIS: It's not that nice.

1130
01:26:33,722 --> 01:26:36,129
MATT: "No, it's not, but you know, it's better than
prison."

1131
01:26:36,129 --> 01:26:38,120
LAURA: There's a lot of beer here.

1132
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:43,120
MATT: "That there is. I may have to start a small
fund for that on its own."

1133
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:47,539
LIAM: What happens to the circus, because, you know,
you can't do the same show for the same people for

1134
01:26:47,539 --> 01:26:48,706
a year?

1135
01:26:48,706 --> 01:26:50,583
MATT: "Where's Ornna? Where's the twins?
Where's--"

1136
01:26:50,583 --> 01:26:53,606
TALIESIN: Well, the twins buggered. Ornna? God
only knows.

1137
01:26:53,606 --> 01:26:55,316
ASHLEY: Where's Toya?

1138
01:26:55,316 --> 01:27:00,846
TALIESIN: Toya is back at the circus, but shaken.
Very shaken.

1139
01:27:00,846 --> 01:27:07,388
MATT: At which point, Gustav just begins making a
beeline for the circus. Bosun goes, "Oh." (sighs)

1140
01:27:07,388 --> 01:27:13,349
TALIESIN: How hard can it be to make 2,000 gold?

1141
01:27:13,349 --> 01:27:18,530
MATT: "I don't know how much he saved. Nowhere
near that much, probably."

1142
01:27:18,530 --> 01:27:21,500
TALIESIN: How hard can it be to steal 2,000 gold?

1143
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:27,639
LAURA: I don't know how many people around here
have that much. Although, the breweries might.

1144
01:27:27,639 --> 01:27:33,462
TALIESIN: Maybe be best to find that gold
elsewhere.

1145
01:27:33,462 --> 01:27:37,181
ASHLEY: Wait, so who killed him?

1146
01:27:37,181 --> 01:27:46,037
MATT: Gustav has spun around and comes back and is
like, "Sincerely. I appreciate the aid, but don't.

1147
01:27:46,037 --> 01:27:52,193
"This is on me. I'll take care of it. This is not
your responsibility. It's not your responsibility.

1148
01:27:52,193 --> 01:27:57,716
"You guys have already done so much. It's fine.
I'll take care of it."

1149
01:27:57,716 --> 01:28:06,225
TALIESIN: Suppose we should take a look at what's
left of the circus.

1150
01:28:06,225 --> 01:28:11,614
MARISHA: Can I go take a look around? Do I see
Zeenoth anywhere?

1151
01:28:11,614 --> 01:28:14,362
MATT: Make a perception check.

1152
01:28:14,362 --> 01:28:19,862
MARISHA: Oh, god damn it, it was almost better. It
was almost good. Ten.

1153
01:28:19,862 --> 01:28:22,563
MATT: Ten? You don't see anybody immediately
around.

1154
01:28:22,563 --> 01:28:28,188
LAURA: Was that Archivist Zeenoth that was outside?

1155
01:28:28,188 --> 01:28:30,487
MARISHA: Archivist.

1156
01:28:30,487 --> 01:28:32,767
LAURA: That's what I said. Was that who it was
that was like--

1157
01:28:32,767 --> 01:28:35,855
MATT: No, Zeenoth was still inside the courtroom when
you were leaving.

1158
01:28:35,855 --> 01:28:37,840
MARISHA: Yeah. Different guy.

1159
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,710
LAURA: Oh, who was it that was outside?

1160
01:28:39,710 --> 01:28:41,077
LIAM: We don't know, we didn't see him.

1161
01:28:41,077 --> 01:28:42,397
TRAVIS: It's very late, right?

1162
01:28:42,397 --> 01:28:43,833
MATT: Yeah, it's post-midnight now.

1163
01:28:43,833 --> 01:28:46,493
LAURA: I'm so tired.

1164
01:28:46,493 --> 01:28:52,226
TRAVIS: Don't suppose you want to retire for the
evening? Share a drink together now that this is

1165
01:28:52,226 --> 01:28:53,939
somewhat behind us?

1166
01:28:53,939 --> 01:28:58,243
TALIESIN: I will definitely drink. I think we
should probably drink at our camp then. I'm fine

1167
01:28:58,243 --> 01:29:00,094
inviting them.

1168
01:29:00,094 --> 01:29:07,283
MATT: "Tell you what. As a thanks, we'll grab
Toya. We'll meet you guys-- where are you all staying?"

1169
01:29:07,283 --> 01:29:09,443
MARISHA and LIAM: The Nestled Nook.

1170
01:29:09,443 --> 01:29:12,322
MATT: "We'll come meet you at the Nestled Nook and
I'll get a round for you all. As a thank you."

1171
01:29:12,322 --> 01:29:15,518
TALIESIN: Is this a human thing to-- never mind

1172
01:29:15,593 --> 01:29:18,058
LIAM: Yeah, we're just like tieflings, we're all
alike.

1173
01:29:18,118 --> 01:29:20,526
TALIESIN: I know.

1174
01:29:20,526 --> 01:29:29,706
MATT: "All right. Bosun, come on." They make their
way off to the carnival camp.

1175
01:29:33,006 --> 01:29:35,295
ASHLEY: It was him?

1176
01:29:35,295 --> 01:29:39,933
TALIESIN: Kylre went bad. Maybe he'd already
always been bad, I don't know.

1177
01:29:39,933 --> 01:29:44,279
LAURA: I mean, he attacked us. A lot of guards,
too.

1178
01:29:44,279 --> 01:29:47,981
SAM: He was an evil fiend. When he joined the
circus, who brought him in?

1179
01:29:47,981 --> 01:29:50,738
TALIESIN: Let's not be throwing words around.

1180
01:29:50,738 --> 01:29:53,978
SAM: No, he was literally an evil fiend.

1181
01:29:53,978 --> 01:29:57,728
LAURA: He summoned imps.

1182
01:29:57,728 --> 01:29:58,921
TALIESIN: He did summon--

1183
01:29:58,921 --> 01:30:00,814
LAURA: He summoned imps, Yasha!

1184
01:30:00,814 --> 01:30:02,666
SAM: He controlled the girl!

1185
01:30:02,666 --> 01:30:05,028
TALIESIN: He was fine for years. Something set him
off.

1186
01:30:05,139 --> 01:30:09,755
LIAM : Ah, he said it himself, you people in the
circus are weird, right? So, every once in a

1187
01:30:09,755 --> 01:30:11,540
while, a glitch.

1188
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:14,430
MARISHA: A glitch? What?

1189
01:30:14,430 --> 01:30:20,266
TALIESIN: He was fine for so long. There was
nothing for so long. Why? Things don't just...

1190
01:30:20,266 --> 01:30:23,487
MARISHA: I still think there's something creepy
about this lake, man.

1191
01:30:23,487 --> 01:30:25,079
TALIESIN: Maybe?

1192
01:30:25,079 --> 01:30:27,253
MARISHA: It gives me the heebie jeebies.

1193
01:30:27,253 --> 01:30:28,960
TALIESIN: Everything gives me the heebie jeebies.

1194
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:33,715
LIAM: Well, if it is this thing that we've read
about in the book, then perhaps he needed to feed

1195
01:30:33,715 --> 01:30:35,780
more or was impatient for some reason?

1196
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:38,418
ASHLEY: What's happened with Toya?

1197
01:30:38,418 --> 01:30:39,822
TALIESIN: Shite.

1198
01:30:39,822 --> 01:30:42,771
ASHLEY: How is she?

1199
01:30:42,771 --> 01:30:46,879
TALIESIN: She is not good. She is taking it as you
would expect.

1200
01:30:46,879 --> 01:30:49,808
SAM: Also Beau crushed her windpipe.

1201
01:30:49,808 --> 01:30:52,542
TALIESIN: That's true. With her stick.

1202
01:30:52,542 --> 01:30:57,139
LIAM: And, I'm sorry, are we also taking the
bouncer into our little coven of weirdos. Is that

1203
01:30:57,139 --> 01:30:58,515
a thing that's happening?

1204
01:30:58,515 --> 01:30:59,546
ASHLEY: Oh, well--

1205
01:30:59,546 --> 01:31:00,972
TALIESIN: Always.

1206
01:31:00,972 --> 01:31:05,144
ASHLEY: I mean, I kind of go on my own, but--

1207
01:31:05,144 --> 01:31:07,723
MARISHA: Yeah, she's one of us.

1208
01:31:07,723 --> 01:31:10,075
TALIESIN: She's the charm, she has to come!

1209
01:31:10,075 --> 01:31:14,245
LIAM: I'm too tired to argue. Let's get that
drink.

1210
01:31:14,245 --> 01:31:18,819
TALIESIN: See, charm. Drink.

1211
01:31:18,819 --> 01:31:23,568
MATT: As you make your way back to the Nestled
Nook Inn, within the tavern, and within the next

1212
01:31:23,568 --> 01:31:30,887
hour or so, Gustav and Bosun, Toya and Ornna all
come in and join you. You guys crowd a few tables

1213
01:31:30,887 --> 01:31:37,652
together, and under what is generally a pretty
empty tavern this night, you guys, for the most

1214
01:31:37,793 --> 01:31:39,954
part, dominate the center space.

1215
01:31:39,954 --> 01:31:45,183
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, Yasha, for new patrons, you're
going to have to surrender your sword.

1216
01:31:45,183 --> 01:31:52,508
ASHLEY: (laughs) You're very funny.

1217
01:31:52,508 --> 01:31:54,679
TALIESIN: He is very funny.

1218
01:31:54,679 --> 01:31:57,738
LIAM: That is a very sick burn.

1219
01:31:57,738 --> 01:32:00,119
MARISHA: Speaking of swords--

1220
01:32:00,119 --> 01:32:04,914
LAURA: Careful Fjord, we haven't been healed yet,
you know. She could take you down.

1221
01:32:04,914 --> 01:32:07,084
ASHLEY: You could always try to take it.

1222
01:32:07,084 --> 01:32:08,237
TALIESIN: Arm wrestle.

1223
01:32:08,237 --> 01:32:09,317
TRAVIS: I could, couldn't I?

1224
01:32:09,317 --> 01:32:10,307
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1225
01:32:10,307 --> 01:32:12,357
MARISHA: Arm wrestle!

1226
01:32:12,357 --> 01:32:16,240
ASHLEY: You do look pretty strong. I mean, you're
just a little bit bigger than me, but I still

1227
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:19,133
think I could probably take you.

1228
01:32:19,133 --> 01:32:20,737
TRAVIS: Looks could be deceiving.

1229
01:32:20,737 --> 01:32:22,523
MARISHA: Arm wrestle! Bets on Yasha.

1230
01:32:22,523 --> 01:32:24,676
LAURA: Do it! Arm wrestle!

1231
01:32:24,676 --> 01:32:27,579
TRAVIS: I just thought it would be a nice
gesture.

1232
01:32:27,579 --> 01:32:29,217
LAURA: To arm wrestle?

1233
01:32:29,217 --> 01:32:31,303
TRAVIS: No, to give up her sword.

1234
01:32:31,303 --> 01:32:36,246
ASHLEY: What about your sword?

1235
01:32:36,246 --> 01:32:39,484
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm a paying patron here. They know me
<i>quite</i> well.

1236
01:32:39,484 --> 01:32:45,137
TALIESIN: So? You've got to be putting something
on the table, though. Well, if you want to

1237
01:32:45,137 --> 01:32:46,920
surrender the sword or not surrender the sword.

1238
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:49,088
TRAVIS: Did you want to stay in that room any
longer, Molly?

1239
01:32:49,088 --> 01:32:50,658
TALIESIN: (laughs) Never.

1240
01:32:50,658 --> 01:32:52,563
MARISHA: I don't know what we're talking about
anymore.

1241
01:32:52,563 --> 01:32:53,734
LAURA: I don't either.

1242
01:32:53,734 --> 01:32:54,708
TRAVIS: Let's get a drink.

1243
01:32:54,708 --> 01:32:55,800
MARISHA: Are you guys going to arm wrestle?

1244
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:56,512
TRAVIS: No.

1245
01:32:56,512 --> 01:33:03,321
MARISHA: Okay. How about "Boulder, Paper, Shears"?
Wait, what is it? "Boulder, Parchment, Shears"!

1246
01:33:03,321 --> 01:33:05,031
TALIESIN: That's a stupid game.

1247
01:33:05,031 --> 01:33:06,509
SAM: I never heard of that game.

1248
01:33:06,509 --> 01:33:12,007
ASHLEY: I think it's something that kids play. I
have a better version of that game. We can play it

1249
01:33:12,007 --> 01:33:13,224
later.

1250
01:33:13,224 --> 01:33:17,772
MATT: The rest of the carnival in presence, Gustav
goes and orders a round of drinks to all of you

1251
01:33:17,772 --> 01:33:25,872
and then sits down. Toya still looks a bit shaken,
but seems to be comforted with the rest of the

1252
01:33:25,872 --> 01:33:30,688
family around her, that still remain at least.
Desmond's come and joined as well. As you're all

1253
01:33:30,688 --> 01:33:34,297
sitting together for a bit, there's a moment of
quiet as you're all sipping, and just tiredly

1254
01:33:34,297 --> 01:33:46,417
thinking over the events of the evening. Toya
breaks the silence, "Is the family going away? Am

1255
01:33:46,417 --> 01:33:53,700
I going to be alone again?" Ornna looks over at
her and goes, "Not if I can help it. It's you and

1256
01:33:53,700 --> 01:34:02,684
me, kid, against the world." Bosun pats Ornna on
the shoulder and says, "Well, if you'd have me,

1257
01:34:02,684 --> 01:34:09,281
you can probably use a strong arm." Ornna looks
back at him. Ornna and him have had this

1258
01:34:09,345 --> 01:34:15,643
rivalry tension for a while. She goes, "You know
what? Sure. The trio makes for a strong pack of

1259
01:34:15,643 --> 01:34:23,116
performers. Desmond, are you in?" And Desmond is
just sitting there, staring into his cup and goes,

1260
01:34:23,116 --> 01:34:33,629
"I see a new family before me. And one I fear
that's a story I could only spoil. No, I thank

1261
01:34:33,629 --> 01:34:44,416
you, but I'll find my own path." And he just sits
there kind of quietly in this somewhat sad space.

1262
01:34:44,416 --> 01:34:57,599
He gives a brief pat and side hug to Bosun before
standing up and leaving. Gustav stands up and

1263
01:34:57,599 --> 01:35:09,450
looks around. "I'm sorry for everything. For all
the pain this has caused you, for all the pain

1264
01:35:09,450 --> 01:35:16,017
it's caused you." Looks at Toya, "For all the pain
it's caused you, little one."

1265
01:35:16,439 --> 01:35:22,181
TRAVIS: We had quite the adventure, actually. I
know people were hurt, but that was really

1266
01:35:22,181 --> 01:35:24,367
something.

1267
01:35:24,367 --> 01:35:29,131
MARISHA: And apparently, nobody really cared about
Enon, so that's, you know, good for your

1268
01:35:29,131 --> 01:35:31,668
conscience.

1269
01:35:31,668 --> 01:35:37,399
MATT: "Everyone's conscience is heavy with its own
reasoning."

1270
01:35:37,399 --> 01:35:41,013
TALIESIN: Get no blame from me.

1271
01:35:41,013 --> 01:35:45,900
MATT: "I appreciate that. We are our own worst
enemy, are we not?"

1272
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:48,318
TALIESIN: Ah, cheers to that!

1273
01:35:48,318 --> 01:35:53,741
LIAM: I catch Nott's eye and silently mouth the
word 'lunatics'.

1274
01:35:53,741 --> 01:35:56,902
SAM: Yeah, yeah.

1275
01:35:56,902 --> 01:36:05,097
MATT: "Well, I think that's the end of my
carnival." (laughs)

1276
01:36:05,097 --> 01:36:07,017
LAURA: It was such a good carnival.

1277
01:36:07,017 --> 01:36:09,537
MATT: "It was a good run! It was a really good
run."

1278
01:36:09,537 --> 01:36:13,016
MARISHA: Man, we caught the last show, you guys!

1279
01:36:13,016 --> 01:36:14,933
TALIESIN: Not our best show.

1280
01:36:14,933 --> 01:36:16,615
LAURA: I liked it.

1281
01:36:16,615 --> 01:36:18,724
SAM: The tickets are probably worth something!

1282
01:36:18,724 --> 01:36:19,819
MARISHA: They might!

1283
01:36:19,819 --> 01:36:21,232
TRAVIS: Closed it down.

1284
01:36:21,232 --> 01:36:22,645
MARISHA: I'm gonna keep this flyer.

1285
01:36:22,645 --> 01:36:24,059
TALIESIN: You have plans?

1286
01:36:26,025 --> 01:36:30,392
ASHLEY: No, I'm just going to float around like I
usually do.

1287
01:36:30,392 --> 01:36:40,168
TALIESIN: I don't know, I'm thinking about it. I
don't know where I'm going to end up now.

1288
01:36:40,168 --> 01:36:47,240
MATT: "You can go with Bosun and Ornna, if you
like. You guys are still carrying on. I mean, I'm

1289
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:51,583
not going to keep the tent, I'm not going to keep
the supplies. I might hock some of it to try and

1290
01:36:51,583 --> 01:36:59,824
pay off my debt, but-- take what you want. Start
anew. It's my gift to you." They all kind of,

1291
01:36:59,824 --> 01:37:07,981
"Thank you very much. We'll start small, I don't
think we need too much of the ensemble. How we

1292
01:37:07,981 --> 01:37:11,559
began, back up in Shady Creek."

1293
01:37:13,509 --> 01:37:18,586
LAURA: I mean, I could use a really large tent.
Like the biggest one? I would take that off your

1294
01:37:18,639 --> 01:37:19,682
hands.

1295
01:37:19,682 --> 01:37:20,993
TALIESIN: The biggest one's a bit--

1296
01:37:20,993 --> 01:37:23,051
TRAVIS: What would you do with a really large
tent?

1297
01:37:23,051 --> 01:37:30,898
LAURA: I don't know, I could open up a hotel? Or I
could make a bunch of dresses. Or--

1298
01:37:30,898 --> 01:37:32,381
SAM: Out of the tent?

1299
01:37:32,381 --> 01:37:33,297
LAURA: Yeah!

1300
01:37:33,297 --> 01:37:35,594
TALIESIN: You could make a lot of dresses out of
that tent. That's fair.

1301
01:37:35,594 --> 01:37:37,147
LAURA: Yeah, right? It's really pretty fabric.

1302
01:37:37,147 --> 01:37:38,545
TALIESIN: Thank you.

1303
01:37:41,155 --> 01:37:43,249
LAURA: (gasps) A hot air balloon!

1304
01:37:43,453 --> 01:37:44,958
TALIESIN: I don't--

1305
01:37:44,958 --> 01:37:46,216
LIAM: A what?

1306
01:37:46,216 --> 01:37:48,308
SAM: Those aren't invented.

1307
01:37:48,308 --> 01:37:50,310
LAURA: Haven't you seen airships?

1308
01:37:50,310 --> 01:37:51,514
SAM: No!

1309
01:37:51,514 --> 01:37:56,710
LIAM: They generally run from crystals. I've seen
that kind before.

1310
01:37:56,710 --> 01:37:57,789
LAURA: Yeah!

1311
01:37:57,789 --> 01:38:00,593
LIAM: Yeah, there's no balloons, though. What's a
balloon?

1312
01:38:00,593 --> 01:38:05,297
MATT: They have simple dirigibles, but they're not
very functional.

1313
01:38:05,297 --> 01:38:09,860
LAURA: Yeah, it just involves fire you guys. We
can figure this shit out.

1314
01:38:09,860 --> 01:38:13,463
LIAM: Oh, a dirigible? Dirigible I've heard of,
but a balloon? I don't know what that is.

1315
01:38:13,463 --> 01:38:15,623
MARISHA: Have the airships made it to this
continent yet?

1316
01:38:15,623 --> 01:38:17,562
LIAM: You don't know.

1317
01:38:17,562 --> 01:38:18,997
SAM: I think, Jester--

1318
01:38:18,997 --> 01:38:21,642
LAURA: I've seen airships, okay? I've seen them.

1319
01:38:21,642 --> 01:38:26,241
SAM: Jester, I think it's safe to say that this
first case is closed!

1320
01:38:26,241 --> 01:38:27,898
LAURA: (gasps)

1321
01:38:27,898 --> 01:38:31,272
SAM: So we could open some sort of private
investigation service.

1322
01:38:31,272 --> 01:38:32,476
LAURA: That's what we should do!

1323
01:38:32,476 --> 01:38:34,577
SAM: Out of a tent.

1324
01:38:34,577 --> 01:38:38,691
LAURA: Let's not open it here, though. This town
sucks!

1325
01:38:38,691 --> 01:38:41,725
TRAVIS: Yeah, we were still planning on moving on
after this.

1326
01:38:41,725 --> 01:38:45,653
MATT: "Bosun and Ornna, you guys can use that
tent, right?" "Yeah, I think we'll take the tent."

1327
01:38:45,653 --> 01:38:46,771
"All right."

1328
01:38:46,771 --> 01:38:49,025
SAM: Aw, they took the tent.

1329
01:38:49,025 --> 01:38:52,272
LAURA: Aw. We waited too long!

1330
01:38:52,272 --> 01:38:55,770
SAM: You got to jump on the tent when it becomes
available.

1331
01:38:55,770 --> 01:39:02,499
LIAM: You know, just out of curiosity, what's
everybody plan to do now?

1332
01:39:02,499 --> 01:39:06,485
SAM: Well do we have to leave? I mean I'm not
wanted anymore.

1333
01:39:06,485 --> 01:39:11,747
LIAM: You were never wanted. Back to my
question--

1334
01:39:11,747 --> 01:39:16,816
LAURA: Fjord and I are going to try and get him
into the Academy.

1335
01:39:16,816 --> 01:39:22,533
TRAVIS: Well, I wanted to find out more about the
Soltrice Academy, yes. I didn't know what

1336
01:39:22,533 --> 01:39:27,348
direction you were heading. I never even asked
what you were doing here in the first place.

1337
01:39:27,348 --> 01:39:32,664
MARISHA: Oh, you know, I'm just doing a walking
tour? Through the continent, just kind of--

1338
01:39:32,664 --> 01:39:33,844
TRAVIS: A walking tour?

1339
01:39:33,844 --> 01:39:38,881
MARISHA: Yeah, just like a backpack vacation, you
know? Just stretch my legs a little bit. Meeting

1340
01:39:38,881 --> 01:39:44,520
some fine people. Discovering myself.

1341
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:46,419
TRAVIS: Are you on a vacation?

1342
01:39:46,419 --> 01:39:48,170
MARISHA: Yes.

1343
01:39:48,170 --> 01:39:51,538
TRAVIS: Bring a lot of money with you for that
vacation, did you?

1344
01:39:51,538 --> 01:39:54,237
MARISHA: What's it matter to you?

1345
01:39:54,237 --> 01:39:59,009
TRAVIS: I don't believe you're on vacation. Where
are you going?

1346
01:39:59,009 --> 01:40:07,360
MARISHA: (laughs) That's your problem. So, you
guys going to take off or do you guys want company

1347
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:08,960
or-- ?

1348
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:13,331
MATT: Gustav finishes the drink and goes, "Well,
I'm going to go get some sleep and try and figure

1349
01:40:13,331 --> 01:40:17,038
out how to put my life together. I bid you all a
wonderful night--"

1350
01:40:17,038 --> 01:40:25,131
LAURA: Gustav, wait! Here. And I take off one of
my rings. This is an old family heirloom, and I

1351
01:40:25,131 --> 01:40:30,109
hope it can help you pay some of your debt.

1352
01:40:30,109 --> 01:40:34,934
TALIESIN: I want to spy the rings on her hand, by
the way, really quickly.

1353
01:40:34,934 --> 01:40:37,732
MATT: "Looks just like the one I lost off my
pinky."

1354
01:40:37,732 --> 01:40:41,193
LAURA: Well, that's so weird that you and my
family have the same looking ones.

1355
01:40:41,193 --> 01:40:42,968
MATT: "That's wonderful, thank you so much."

1356
01:40:42,968 --> 01:40:43,760
LAURA: You're welcome.

1357
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:45,290
MATT: "That's very sweet."

1358
01:40:45,290 --> 01:40:48,996
TALIESIN: I want to look at the other rings she
picked up, not that she's wearing right now.

1359
01:40:48,996 --> 01:40:51,343
LAURA: They're right here. You can get a look at
them!

1360
01:40:51,343 --> 01:40:53,019
MATT: They're all over her fingers.

1361
01:40:53,019 --> 01:40:55,870
TALIESIN: They are obviously rings from random
dead people, aren't they?

1362
01:40:55,870 --> 01:40:56,818
MATT: Yeah.

1363
01:40:56,818 --> 01:40:58,965
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm just putting that together.

1364
01:41:02,405 --> 01:41:04,862
LAURA: I play dinosaur fights.

1365
01:41:04,974 --> 01:41:12,710
MATT: Gustav puts his hat on. "Yasha, be safe, and
punch anyone who gets in your way."

1366
01:41:12,710 --> 01:41:14,466
ASHLEY: I will.

1367
01:41:14,466 --> 01:41:18,799
MATT: "Mollymauk, I hope you find what you're
looking for."

1368
01:41:18,799 --> 01:41:21,045
TALIESIN: I think I will.

1369
01:41:21,045 --> 01:41:29,445
MATT: "To the new family, don't make the same
mistakes your forefathers did. The rest of you,

1370
01:41:29,445 --> 01:41:30,777
thank you."

1371
01:41:30,777 --> 01:41:32,785
LAURA: (whispers) He said forefathers.

1372
01:41:32,785 --> 01:41:34,438
SAM: (whispers) That's progressive.

1373
01:41:34,438 --> 01:41:36,510
(laughter)

1374
01:41:36,510 --> 01:41:38,944
MATT: "I bid you all adieu," and he exits.

1375
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:42,397
LAURA: What are you looking for, Molly?

1376
01:41:42,397 --> 01:41:47,036
TALIESIN: Hmm, I'm not quite done with this one.
We'll see.

1377
01:41:47,036 --> 01:41:49,236
ASHLEY: Toya.

1378
01:41:49,236 --> 01:41:53,727
MATT: Bosun and Ornna stood up and Toya is there,
"Yeah?"

1379
01:41:53,727 --> 01:41:56,929
ASHLEY: What are your plans? What do you want to
do?

1380
01:41:56,929 --> 01:42:07,408
MATT: "I figure I'll just move on with Bo and
Ornna and make a new show. Something with a little

1381
01:42:07,408 --> 01:42:14,008
less death. That's what I'd like."

1382
01:42:14,008 --> 01:42:20,382
LAURA: You should make your way to the Menagerie
Coast. I think you guys would have a lot of

1383
01:42:20,382 --> 01:42:23,164
success in Nicodranas.

1384
01:42:23,164 --> 01:42:24,907
MATT: "I haven't been to Nicodranas."

1385
01:42:24,907 --> 01:42:27,159
LAURA: It's <i>beautiful</i>.

1386
01:42:27,159 --> 01:42:33,537
MATT: She looks up and tugs on the side of Bosun's
sleeve. "You know, I actually haven't been there

1387
01:42:33,537 --> 01:42:35,286
either."

1388
01:42:35,286 --> 01:42:39,063
LAURA: They're always looking for good performers.
You would do well.

1389
01:42:39,063 --> 01:42:46,642
MATT: "Hmm. Let's go ahead and make our way. That
sounds like a nice change of pace, and this empire

1390
01:42:46,642 --> 01:42:50,315
is getting a little stuffy for me anyway."

1391
01:42:50,315 --> 01:42:56,277
MARISHA: I've bend down to Toya, and I take off
one of the little jade bangles around my wrist,

1392
01:42:56,277 --> 01:43:07,457
and I say, "Here. This will keep you safe from
assholes named Beau. Except for that asshole,

1393
01:43:07,457 --> 01:43:11,434
named Bo. He's a good Bo, but all other assholes
named Beau."

1394
01:43:11,434 --> 01:43:15,822
MATT: You watch as Ornna elbows him and is like,
"Oh, no, he's an asshole too. It's fine."

1395
01:43:15,822 --> 01:43:16,871
TALIESIN: It's true.

1396
01:43:16,871 --> 01:43:19,890
MARISHA: Sorry. Sorry again about that.

1397
01:43:19,890 --> 01:43:27,094
MATT: She takes it and goes, "It's okay. I know
you did what you had to. But when I'm older, I'm

1398
01:43:27,094 --> 01:43:29,093
going to get you back."

1399
01:43:29,093 --> 01:43:31,534
MARISHA: You better.

1400
01:43:31,534 --> 01:43:33,449
LAURA: Your first nemesis!

1401
01:43:33,449 --> 01:43:35,061
MARISHA: My first nemesis!

1402
01:43:35,061 --> 01:43:36,988
MATT: Is a twelve year old girl!

1403
01:43:36,988 --> 01:43:38,244
(laughter)

1404
01:43:38,244 --> 01:43:42,155
MARISHA: I give her a little chin (weak punch
sound).

1405
01:43:42,155 --> 01:43:43,611
TRAVIS: She goes unconscious.

1406
01:43:43,611 --> 01:43:46,092
(laughter)

1407
01:43:46,092 --> 01:43:49,733
MARISHA: Aw, why? No!

1408
01:43:49,733 --> 01:43:57,115
MATT: The three of them stand up and give a nod,
wordlessly look over the rest of you with a smile

1409
01:43:57,115 --> 01:44:06,102
of thanks, and Bosun looks to you and makes eye
contact and goes, "Take care, brother. It gets

1410
01:44:06,102 --> 01:44:09,298
tougher for us up north."

1411
01:44:09,298 --> 01:44:11,856
TRAVIS: I'll keep that in mind.

1412
01:44:11,856 --> 01:44:14,816
MATT: And they all leave the inn.

1413
01:44:18,777 --> 01:44:22,922
ASHLEY: I mean, I'll say it. I don't know if you
will, but I think that little girl is creepy.

1414
01:44:22,922 --> 01:44:25,529
(laughter)

1415
01:44:25,529 --> 01:44:32,624
TALIESIN: Oh no, she's had a thing the entire
time. There was a little while I thought she was

1416
01:44:32,624 --> 01:44:34,289
in on it completely.

1417
01:44:34,289 --> 01:44:35,164
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1418
01:44:35,164 --> 01:44:36,434
LAURA: I mean, she might have been.

1419
01:44:36,434 --> 01:44:38,453
TALIESIN: I've known her for years. I just assumed
that she was in on it.

1420
01:44:38,453 --> 01:44:41,359
LAURA: She could've been in on it, and just got
right away with it.

1421
01:44:41,359 --> 01:44:44,003
TALIESIN: Yeah. That would be great.

1422
01:44:44,003 --> 01:44:45,368
LAURA: She's good.

1423
01:44:45,368 --> 01:44:48,348
MARISHA: For her, yeah, I mean I got to give it to
her, yeah.

1424
01:44:48,348 --> 01:44:52,260
TALIESIN: You know, no matter what you pick,
you're always welcome, right?

1425
01:44:52,260 --> 01:44:53,110
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1426
01:44:53,110 --> 01:44:54,615
TALIESIN: Wherever you end up.

1427
01:44:54,615 --> 01:44:58,218
ASHLEY: Maybe for a little bit, but I've got some
things I need do, so.

1428
01:44:58,218 --> 01:45:00,677
LAURA: Do you guys want to travel with me and
Fjord?

1429
01:45:00,677 --> 01:45:04,454
ASHLEY: Where are you going, again?

1430
01:45:04,454 --> 01:45:07,210
TRAVIS: Up north. Northeast to the Solstryce
Academy.

1431
01:45:07,210 --> 01:45:08,807
LIAM: Straight there.

1432
01:45:08,807 --> 01:45:10,577
TALIESIN: Northeast. I've always wanted to go
there.

1433
01:45:10,577 --> 01:45:14,004
ASHLEY: Where's... where northeast?

1434
01:45:14,004 --> 01:45:15,867
LAURA: Um...

1435
01:45:16,661 --> 01:45:18,531
(chuckles)

1436
01:45:18,531 --> 01:45:19,829
SAM: We're here.

1437
01:45:19,829 --> 01:45:21,320
(laughter)

1438
01:45:21,320 --> 01:45:23,709
MATT: Well technically, you don't have a map.

1439
01:45:23,709 --> 01:45:25,128
SAM: Oh, no.

1440
01:45:25,128 --> 01:45:29,843
LAURA: We should really get a map, you guys. I
haven't spent a lot of time in this area and I

1441
01:45:29,843 --> 01:45:32,925
don't really know where we're going.

1442
01:45:32,925 --> 01:45:37,979
TRAVIS: We're kind of going from town to town and
asking as we go. Afraid we don't know too much.

1443
01:45:37,979 --> 01:45:42,654
LAURA: I wonder if there's a place-- maybe at the
general store? They would have a map? Or do you

1444
01:45:42,654 --> 01:45:45,037
have to go to a map maker?

1445
01:45:45,037 --> 01:45:46,990
TALIESIN: Traditionally, you have to go to a map
maker.

1446
01:45:46,990 --> 01:45:48,784
MATT: Traditionally but it can depend.

1447
01:45:48,784 --> 01:45:50,950
TALIESIN: We might have a bit of something at the
circus, I don't know.

1448
01:45:50,950 --> 01:45:53,261
ASHLEY: I would love a map.

1449
01:45:53,261 --> 01:45:56,858
LAURA: We'll go looking for things tomorrow. We
can go shopping.

1450
01:45:57,772 --> 01:46:00,041
ASHLEY: Okay. We'll go shopping with you.

1451
01:46:00,041 --> 01:46:01,261
LAURA: Yeah.

1452
01:46:01,261 --> 01:46:07,331
MARISHA: Where are you guys heading off to? Seems
like people are making pretty big plans.

1453
01:46:07,331 --> 01:46:09,496
TRAVIS: There's safety in numbers, you know?

1454
01:46:09,496 --> 01:46:13,009
LIAM: Yeah. Took the words out of my mouth.

1455
01:46:13,009 --> 01:46:17,316
LAURA: Nott, don't you want to travel with us,
too?

1456
01:46:17,316 --> 01:46:21,081
SAM: Um, is she coming?

1457
01:46:21,081 --> 01:46:23,078
LAURA: Yeah, she just said she was.

1458
01:46:23,078 --> 01:46:24,622
ASHLEY: Oh, are you scared of me?

1459
01:46:24,622 --> 01:46:26,679
SAM: A little bit. You're very big.

1460
01:46:26,679 --> 01:46:31,266
ASHLEY: Well, I thought you were Nott, the Brave?

1461
01:46:31,266 --> 01:46:34,492
SAM: Oh. No, there's no comma.

1462
01:46:34,492 --> 01:46:36,144
LAURA: (laughs)

1463
01:46:36,144 --> 01:46:37,896
SAM: I'm just Nott the Brave.

1464
01:46:37,896 --> 01:46:41,947
(laughter)

1465
01:46:48,962 --> 01:46:53,433
LIAM: I don't know. You know, Nott and I have been
travelling together for a while and two is better

1466
01:46:53,433 --> 01:46:57,549
than one, although still very difficult.

1467
01:46:57,549 --> 01:47:01,054
MARISHA: How long ago was it that you guys broke
out of prison?

1468
01:47:01,054 --> 01:47:06,951
LIAM: Uh... you know, it was six months ago,
about. Five, six months ago.

1469
01:47:06,951 --> 01:47:08,905
MARISHA: Damn, you guys are doing good.

1470
01:47:08,905 --> 01:47:10,315
TALIESIN: Insight check.

1471
01:47:10,315 --> 01:47:11,358
MATT: Against--

1472
01:47:11,358 --> 01:47:13,124
TALIESIN: Five or six months ago.

1473
01:47:13,124 --> 01:47:14,405
MATT: Yeah.

1474
01:47:15,407 --> 01:47:16,837
LAURA: Oh, that was so close.

1475
01:47:16,837 --> 01:47:18,234
TALIESIN: 14.

1476
01:47:18,234 --> 01:47:19,480
SAM: You have to roll, don't you?

1477
01:47:19,480 --> 01:47:20,821
LAURA: Yeah.

1478
01:47:20,821 --> 01:47:23,861
MATT: Roll either persuasion or deception. You can
choose. Don't--

1479
01:47:23,861 --> 01:47:25,861
LIAM: I'll do persuasion.

1480
01:47:25,861 --> 01:47:28,618
MATT: I mean, you don't have to say but you did.
That's fine.

1481
01:47:28,618 --> 01:47:33,799
LIAM: That's uh, I don't know where on my
character sheet is. That's also a 14.

1482
01:47:33,799 --> 01:47:34,506
LAURA: Oh.

1483
01:47:34,506 --> 01:47:36,310
MATT: All right, so seems on the level.

1484
01:47:36,310 --> 01:47:37,650
TALIESIN: All right.

1485
01:47:37,650 --> 01:47:40,042
LAURA: (laughs)

1486
01:47:40,042 --> 01:47:43,104
TRAVIS: Broke out of prison? That's very
impressive.

1487
01:47:43,104 --> 01:47:51,533
SAM: Well, it was mainly Caleb. We had to get out.
I mean, it was a bad place.

1488
01:47:51,533 --> 01:47:52,986
LAURA: Were they going to kill you?

1489
01:47:52,986 --> 01:47:55,165
SAM: We would have died, for sure.

1490
01:47:55,165 --> 01:47:58,365
ASHLEY: But you guys were there together? Because
you knew each other before?

1491
01:47:58,365 --> 01:48:03,328
LIAM: Well, first of all, she's being modest. It
was not just me at all, I could not have gotten

1492
01:48:03,328 --> 01:48:07,532
out of there without you. I don't think you could
have gotten out of there without me either but you

1493
01:48:07,532 --> 01:48:08,225
know.

1494
01:48:08,225 --> 01:48:09,529
SAM: That's true, for sure.

1495
01:48:09,529 --> 01:48:13,430
LIAM: That's why I said two. Better than one. One
is the loneliest number.

1496
01:48:13,430 --> 01:48:15,348
LAURA: That you'll ever see.

1497
01:48:15,348 --> 01:48:16,585
LIAM: Yeah.

1498
01:48:16,585 --> 01:48:19,671
MARISHA: There's nothing wrong with being alone.

1499
01:48:19,671 --> 01:48:23,996
LIAM: You know, normally I wouldn't feel
comfortable talking about shit like this but you

1500
01:48:23,996 --> 01:48:26,991
are all very shifty.

1501
01:48:26,991 --> 01:48:28,601
LAURA: I'm very trustworthy.

1502
01:48:28,601 --> 01:48:29,627
TALIESIN: Thank you.

1503
01:48:29,627 --> 01:48:32,305
LIAM: No, no, no, you're shifty as well. Yeah.

1504
01:48:32,305 --> 01:48:33,649
TALIESIN: It's true.

1505
01:48:33,649 --> 01:48:37,809
TRAVIS: In the short time we've spent with you,
you seem to be very upstanding folks. I'm sure it

1506
01:48:37,809 --> 01:48:40,281
wasn't for anything too serious.

1507
01:48:40,281 --> 01:48:46,155
LIAM: No, nothing serious at all, really. I was
too curious. She was maybe a little thirsty. You

1508
01:48:46,155 --> 01:48:49,940
know, petty stuff.

1509
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:54,166
SAM: But they treated us very badly and we needed
to get out of there.

1510
01:48:54,166 --> 01:48:56,230
LIAM: We all know how this country works.

1511
01:48:56,230 --> 01:48:57,678
MARISHA: And where was 'there'?

1512
01:48:57,678 --> 01:49:00,123
TRAVIS: Yeah, is there anywhere we should stay
away from on our travels?

1513
01:49:00,123 --> 01:49:01,499
LIAM: (clears throat)

1514
01:49:01,499 --> 01:49:06,913
SAM: Any place is-- I mean, we've been travelling
around a bit but--

1515
01:49:06,913 --> 01:49:09,860
LIAM: You know, I wouldn't go west, maybe.

1516
01:49:09,860 --> 01:49:11,685
TALIESIN: Northwest.

1517
01:49:11,685 --> 01:49:15,740
SAM: I'm told east is bad too. There's monsters.

1518
01:49:15,740 --> 01:49:20,426
LIAM: Yeah and they're pretty terrible in the
north. That's no secret.

1519
01:49:20,426 --> 01:49:22,015
LAURA: So we go south?

1520
01:49:22,015 --> 01:49:23,474
SAM: Oh no, not south.

1521
01:49:23,474 --> 01:49:26,711
(laughter)

1522
01:49:26,711 --> 01:49:31,112
ASHLEY: It just depends where in the south,
actually.

1523
01:49:31,112 --> 01:49:39,542
TALIESIN: I'd be happy keeping a bit of a low-key
existence.

1524
01:49:39,542 --> 01:49:45,254
LAURA: Well, I mean we are vigilantes so it's best
if we, you know, have our secrets.

1525
01:49:45,254 --> 01:49:48,691
TALIESIN: Some of us are a bit sketchy with the
law.

1526
01:49:48,909 --> 01:49:50,088
MARISHA: Yeah.

1527
01:49:50,088 --> 01:49:56,396
LIAM: Mollymauk, you're comfortable leaving the
circus? You are very-- you have a lot of flair.

1528
01:49:56,396 --> 01:50:02,173
TALIESIN: Well, I figured if you're going to live
your life, you're going to live your life.

1529
01:50:02,173 --> 01:50:03,958
LAURA: (jingling)

1530
01:50:03,958 --> 01:50:07,718
TALIESIN: Does do that. There's nothing wrong with
living your life. You only get one of them, or

1531
01:50:07,718 --> 01:50:16,440
mostly. And your days are going to be the days
that you're going to have and I'd like to keep

1532
01:50:16,505 --> 01:50:21,747
living my life the way I'd like to and keep off of
certain radars.

1533
01:50:21,747 --> 01:50:23,182
MARISHA: Cheers to that.

1534
01:50:23,182 --> 01:50:25,072
LAURA: Yeah. Life does need things to live.

1535
01:50:25,072 --> 01:50:26,813
(laughter)

1536
01:50:26,813 --> 01:50:28,766
TALIESIN: Stupid phrase.

1537
01:50:28,766 --> 01:50:30,503
LIAM: That doesn't make any sense at all.

1538
01:50:30,503 --> 01:50:31,940
TALIESIN: Really stupid.

1539
01:50:31,940 --> 01:50:33,165
TRAVIS: Who said that?

1540
01:50:33,165 --> 01:50:36,227
LIAM: I mean, it does but it blatantly obvious and
simplistic.

1541
01:50:36,227 --> 01:50:39,473
(laughter)

1542
01:50:39,473 --> 01:50:40,828
TALIESIN: That's just ridiculous.

1543
01:50:40,828 --> 01:50:44,593
(laughter)

1544
01:50:44,593 --> 01:50:49,160
TALIESIN: That felt so good. That's catharsis.

1545
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:54,431
TRAVIS: Yasha, anywhere that we should avoid for
you?

1546
01:50:54,745 --> 01:51:05,384
ASHLEY: You know. I'm just-- I'll make my way
wherever we go and maybe I'll not stay with you

1547
01:51:05,384 --> 01:51:11,945
the whole time but I don't like, you know--

1548
01:51:11,945 --> 01:51:13,170
TRAVIS: Being confined.

1549
01:51:13,170 --> 01:51:15,860
ASHLEY: Yeah. I don't-- groups and things--

1550
01:51:15,860 --> 01:51:17,450
MARISHA: Are you claustrophobic?

1551
01:51:17,450 --> 01:51:18,837
ASHLEY: Uh, no.

1552
01:51:18,837 --> 01:51:22,787
MARISHA: You mentioned the smaller cl--cramped space
in the cell. Just curious.

1553
01:51:22,787 --> 01:51:24,218
LAURA: Clamp space?

1554
01:51:24,218 --> 01:51:25,743
MARISHA: Clamps-- clampy space.

1555
01:51:25,743 --> 01:51:27,425
TALIESIN: Clam space.

1556
01:51:27,425 --> 01:51:29,990
ASHLEY: I like to have my freedom.

1557
01:51:30,066 --> 01:51:34,290
LIAM: I mean, technically this is a group. You
mean groups bigger than this group or is this

1558
01:51:34,290 --> 01:51:36,377
group too claustrophobic for you or-- ?

1559
01:51:36,377 --> 01:51:40,796
ASHLEY: No. I don't mean it like that. I just want
to make my own way sometimes.

1560
01:51:40,796 --> 01:51:43,753
MARISHA: Not tied down to anything but that cloak,
am I right?

1561
01:51:43,753 --> 01:51:47,144
ASHLEY: (chuckles) Yeah, that's right.

1562
01:51:48,674 --> 01:51:51,879
LAURA: Speaking of cloaks, mine smells really
bad.

1563
01:51:52,152 --> 01:51:57,341
SAM: It was on top of a head. Ugh, that's really
gross.

1564
01:51:57,341 --> 01:52:00,660
LAURA: I'm going to go try to find somewhere to
wash it.

1565
01:52:00,660 --> 01:52:05,148
MATT: Upstairs at the end of the hallway is a
communal washroom. You can find space there.

1566
01:52:05,148 --> 01:52:06,289
LAURA: Hey Caleb!

1567
01:52:06,289 --> 01:52:07,001
LIAM: Yeah?

1568
01:52:07,001 --> 01:52:08,572
LAURA: You know what's upstairs?

1569
01:52:08,572 --> 01:52:09,477
(laughter)

1570
01:52:09,477 --> 01:52:12,886
LAURA: This place where I'm going to go wash some
stuff. You could use it.

1571
01:52:12,886 --> 01:52:14,842
TALIESIN: You smell fine.

1572
01:52:14,842 --> 01:52:17,125
LAURA and MARISHA: (chuckles)

1573
01:52:17,125 --> 01:52:20,496
SAM: I like you just the way you are.

1574
01:52:20,496 --> 01:52:26,421
LAURA: You're bloody now, too, in addition to
being stinky.

1575
01:52:26,421 --> 01:52:29,281
TALIESIN: You should probably get that patched up,
actually, though. That is fair.

1576
01:52:29,281 --> 01:52:30,481
LIAM: (clears throat)

1577
01:52:30,481 --> 01:52:33,056
MARISHA: Yeah, I actually feel like you're
starting to get a rash.

1578
01:52:33,056 --> 01:52:37,211
(laughter)

1579
01:52:37,211 --> 01:52:38,435
LIAM: Yeah, I'm good, thank you.

1580
01:52:38,435 --> 01:52:40,223
(laughter)

1581
01:52:40,223 --> 01:52:41,132
TRAVIS: Damn right.

1582
01:52:41,132 --> 01:52:43,903
(laughter)

1583
01:52:46,593 --> 01:52:47,916
MATT: All right.

1584
01:52:48,598 --> 01:52:54,370
SAM: Well, I suppose we should all go to sleep and
then if any of us are here in the morning, we'll

1585
01:52:54,370 --> 01:52:55,977
set off together?

1586
01:52:55,977 --> 01:52:57,666
TRAVIS: That seems fair.

1587
01:52:57,666 --> 01:53:01,893
TALIESIN: I'm all right with that. Collect our
things from-- my things, anyway, from the circus.

1588
01:53:01,893 --> 01:53:03,473
There should be some spares.

1589
01:53:03,473 --> 01:53:07,429
LIAM: Do we have time to-- look at this, we're
making plans with friends, that's amazing. Do we

1590
01:53:07,429 --> 01:53:10,764
have for errands in the morning? I have a couple
stops. Nothing major.

1591
01:53:10,764 --> 01:53:12,184
TALIESIN: Take me a while to pack.

1592
01:53:12,184 --> 01:53:13,325
LIAM: Yeah.

1593
01:53:13,325 --> 01:53:15,434
MARISHA: You guys want me to tag along with you?

1594
01:53:15,434 --> 01:53:18,788
TRAVIS: If you weren't too anxious to run off
anywhere.

1595
01:53:18,788 --> 01:53:27,028
MARISHA: (chuckles, clears throat) No. I'm free on
my backpack tour. No plans.

1596
01:53:27,028 --> 01:53:31,480
TRAVIS: Right. Any sightseeing we should schedule
along our way?

1597
01:53:31,480 --> 01:53:37,403
MARISHA: Maybe avoid Zadash just because I just
came there, you know. Don't want to hit the same

1598
01:53:37,403 --> 01:53:38,617
place twice.

1599
01:53:38,617 --> 01:53:39,801
TRAVIS: Zadash?

1600
01:53:39,801 --> 01:53:40,807
MARISHA: Yup.

1601
01:53:40,807 --> 01:53:42,209
TRAVIS: Keep that in mind.

1602
01:53:42,209 --> 01:53:47,908
(laughter)

1603
01:53:47,908 --> 01:53:49,619
TALIESIN: Note, note, note.

1604
01:53:49,619 --> 01:53:55,181
MATT: As you guys are all finishing your drinks
and standing up to leave the table, a familiar

1605
01:53:55,181 --> 01:54:02,008
voice pipes in from the center of the tavern.
"Beauregard?"

1606
01:54:03,140 --> 01:54:06,309
MARISHA: (groans)

1607
01:54:06,309 --> 01:54:14,428
MATT: And the Archivist who was there earlier
during the trial in the stockade. "It's been

1608
01:54:14,428 --> 01:54:19,377
difficult to find you. Do you mind if we speak?"

1609
01:54:19,377 --> 01:54:28,324
MARISHA: Hey, Zeenoth! Hey. It's been all of about
twenty minutes since I've seen you last.

1610
01:54:28,324 --> 01:54:35,612
MATT: "Yes, um, would you walk with me? I believe
we have much to discuss."

1611
01:54:35,612 --> 01:54:38,288
MARISHA: Okay.

1612
01:54:38,288 --> 01:54:43,583
MATT: "Don't worry. She'll be returned to you.
Just--"

1613
01:54:43,583 --> 01:54:45,829
TRAVIS: You all right with this?

1614
01:54:45,829 --> 01:54:48,469
MARISHA: It's cool. I've got it.

1615
01:54:48,469 --> 01:54:50,311
TALIESIN: We don't care. We're not that attached
yet.

1616
01:54:50,311 --> 01:54:51,734
LAURA: (laughs)

1617
01:54:51,734 --> 01:54:56,255
MATT: "All right then. This way please,
Beauregard."

1618
01:54:56,255 --> 01:54:58,657
MARISHA: (sighs)

1619
01:54:58,657 --> 01:55:03,660
MATT: The elvish man gives a bow and he seems
jovial.

1620
01:55:08,154 --> 01:55:10,081
(laughter)

1621
01:55:10,081 --> 01:55:12,593
TALIESIN: More mine, more mine!

1622
01:55:12,593 --> 01:55:17,197
MATT: Beau leaves and you guys are able to go
about the rest of your evening to rest however you

1623
01:55:17,197 --> 01:55:19,664
see fit.

1624
01:55:19,664 --> 01:55:25,629
LIAM: Way up after Nott has gone, I go over to
Norda. Is Norda down there?

1625
01:55:25,629 --> 01:55:27,592
SAM: Yorda.

1626
01:55:27,592 --> 01:55:30,724
LIAM: No, there's two people with rhyming names.

1627
01:55:30,724 --> 01:55:32,664
MARISHA: Yorda is the bartender.

1628
01:55:32,664 --> 01:55:34,117
MATT: Yorda is the bartender.

1629
01:55:34,126 --> 01:55:36,264
LIAM: This is revenge for Vex and Vax.

1630
01:55:36,403 --> 01:55:37,824
MATT: Yeah, and Purvon.

1631
01:55:37,824 --> 01:55:40,949
LIAM: I find the purveyor of the establishment.

1632
01:55:40,949 --> 01:55:42,411
MATT: Yorda.

1633
01:55:42,411 --> 01:55:44,737
LIAM: Mork from Ork, that's what I said.

1634
01:55:44,737 --> 01:55:47,458
MATT: "Right, what can I help you with?"

1635
01:55:47,674 --> 01:55:58,520
LIAM: Excuse me, is there-- I know you have a bath
here, but is there a hot bath place like a

1636
01:55:58,520 --> 01:56:06,451
bathhouse? I'm bruised over every inch of my body
and I'm in a lot of pain.

1637
01:56:06,451 --> 01:56:11,368
MATT: "Right, that'll probably be in the
Hillsward. It's a bit pricey, but I don't know if

1638
01:56:11,368 --> 01:56:12,538
it's open this late."

1639
01:56:12,538 --> 01:56:14,718
LIAM: I know, but how much are we talking about?

1640
01:56:14,718 --> 01:56:20,084
MATT: "Oh, I'd put it maybe somewhere in the
neighborhood of five silver for a bath."

1641
01:56:20,084 --> 01:56:22,163
LIAM: That's expensive.

1642
01:56:22,163 --> 01:56:27,068
MATT: "But you get bathed like proper, multiple
people bathing you."

1643
01:56:27,068 --> 01:56:28,563
LIAM: Northward, you say?

1644
01:56:28,563 --> 01:56:30,374
MATT: "No, Hillsward."

1645
01:56:30,374 --> 01:56:33,613
LIAM: Okay, good.

1646
01:56:33,613 --> 01:56:42,327
MATT: "I mean, no offense to you. Their clientele
is a bit, upper class."

1647
01:56:42,327 --> 01:56:44,430
LIAM: I'm not worried.

1648
01:56:44,430 --> 01:56:46,455
MATT: "Alright, fair enough."

1649
01:56:46,455 --> 01:56:50,691
LIAM: <i>Danke</i>. And I head up there.

1650
01:56:50,749 --> 01:56:59,661
MATT: Okay. Beau, as you exit with Zeenoth. As
soon as you step into the night air, a second

1651
01:56:59,661 --> 01:57:04,308
figure flanks your other side. The hooded figure
from earlier that had caught you.

1652
01:57:04,308 --> 01:57:09,156
MARISHA: I just look at Zeenoth and go really? Is
this really necessary?

1653
01:57:09,156 --> 01:57:17,301
MATT: "It is only because it's been so difficult
to find you. I had to call in a favor. Please,

1654
01:57:17,301 --> 01:57:19,806
come with us. We have a warehouse."

1655
01:57:19,806 --> 01:57:26,131
MARISHA: Do we have to with this guy? He fucking--
look at him. He looks shifty.

1656
01:57:26,131 --> 01:57:36,863
MATT: The head turns to you in the hood and you
see dark elvish features. A bald head as the hood

1657
01:57:36,863 --> 01:57:46,607
comes back. What looks to be a female elf of very
lithe form who turns to you and goes, "Actually,

1658
01:57:46,607 --> 01:57:52,137
it is a woman, but I'll ignore that."

1659
01:57:52,137 --> 01:57:58,899
MARISHA: Sorry, you're super covered-- literally
saw no features until right now.

1660
01:57:58,899 --> 01:58:00,695
MATT: "It is fine."

1661
01:58:00,695 --> 01:58:02,570
MARISHA: You're very attractive though.

1662
01:58:02,570 --> 01:58:06,667
(laughter)

1663
01:58:06,667 --> 01:58:10,754
MATT: And she walks ahead of you and the two of
you begin to make your way there. They're guiding

1664
01:58:10,754 --> 01:58:17,438
you towards the Northward and as you step into the
dark following their lead, we're going to take a

1665
01:58:17,438 --> 01:58:18,173
break.

1666
01:58:18,173 --> 01:58:20,292
(cheering)

1667
01:58:20,292 --> 01:58:22,702
MARISHA: I smell bad y'all.

1668
01:58:22,702 --> 01:58:23,594
TRAVIS: Do you?

1669
01:58:23,594 --> 01:58:30,876
MARISHA: Don't. You were like, oh my cape smells
bad and I was like RPing and I like, ooh.

1670
01:58:30,876 --> 01:58:32,595
(laughter)

1671
01:58:32,595 --> 01:58:35,892
TALIESIN: Everybody at home, grab your ticket you
got in the mail. Scratch off number three.

1672
01:58:35,892 --> 01:58:38,348
(laughter)

1673
01:58:38,348 --> 01:58:44,965
MATT: We'll be back here in a few minutes. For
those of you who want to enter the Wyrmwood

1674
01:58:44,965 --> 01:58:50,418
giveaway, tonight it's a special Valentine's Day
promotion from our friends at Wyrmwood. They have

1675
01:58:50,418 --> 01:58:55,897
four types of dice vaults to choose from where
they translate your Valentine Day's message in

1676
01:58:55,897 --> 01:58:57,055
Elvish.

1677
01:58:57,055 --> 01:58:58,014
(gasping)

1678
01:58:58,014 --> 01:58:59,769
TRAVIS: Damn that shit glows!

1679
01:58:59,769 --> 01:59:01,625
MATT: So you have some golden Evish stuff there.

1680
01:59:01,625 --> 01:59:03,596
LAURA: It's pretty and you can choose the wood.

1681
01:59:03,596 --> 01:59:05,932
LIAM: The writing only shows up if you throw it in
fire.

1682
01:59:05,932 --> 01:59:08,005
(laughter)

1683
01:59:08,005 --> 01:59:16,728
MATT: Don't listen to Liam. To whoever is the
winner of this or any of these, they'll go ahead

1684
01:59:16,728 --> 01:59:20,135
and get you the contact information for Wyrmwood
so they can customize your phrase. If you want to

1685
01:59:20,135 --> 01:59:26,413
be part of this giveaway over the break, make sure
to use the keyword toad. T-O-A-D in the chatroom.

1686
01:59:26,413 --> 01:59:32,772
There's also apparently an anti-Valentine's Day
Drow vault they do as well. It's pretty cool.

1687
01:59:32,772 --> 01:59:37,691
Check them out at wyrmwoodgaming.com but if you
want to enter that, the codeword is toad. Only

1688
01:59:37,691 --> 01:59:41,790
enter once please in the Twitch chat because if
you do more than once, you'll be disqualified.

1689
01:59:41,790 --> 01:59:45,916
Wait for them to notify you over the break and
we'll come back with the winner when we return.

1690
01:59:45,916 --> 01:59:52,325
MARISHA: They gave us an amazing matching set with
the Elvis-- Elvish for our wedding. It was super

1691
01:59:52,325 --> 01:59:57,902
sweet. Thanks Wyrmwood. Elvis from Memphis.

1692
01:59:57,902 --> 02:00:01,235
MATT: (Elvis impression) "Oh that was a natural
20." We'll see you guys in a little bit.

1693
02:00:01,235 --> 02:00:03,618
(cheering)

1694
02:00:03,618 --> 02:06:51,505
[break]

1695
02:11:25,900 --> 02:11:32,292
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome back. Before we
jump back in, we have our winner from the chat.

1696
02:11:32,292 --> 02:11:43,013
The winner is Piamo_Feddie! If I am reading this
correctly, Piamo_Feddie. Congratulations! Danoba

1697
02:11:43,013 --> 02:11:46,662
will get your contact information, we'll get that
sent out to you. Well done, and happy Valentine's

1698
02:11:46,662 --> 02:11:53,094
Day. Now jumping back into the game, I would like
to ask everyone but Marisha to leave the table,

1699
02:11:53,094 --> 02:11:55,066
please.

1700
02:11:55,066 --> 02:11:57,673
MARISHA: See you, guys.

1701
02:12:01,243 --> 02:12:03,110
TRAVIS: Don't die!

1702
02:12:08,260 --> 02:12:11,231
MARISHA: This is so scary! So nerve wracking.

1703
02:12:16,066 --> 02:12:17,215
MATT: Beauregard.

1704
02:12:17,215 --> 02:12:18,812
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

1705
02:12:18,812 --> 02:12:28,209
MATT: Quietly, they walk you through the night
air, through the Northward, to a familiar place:

1706
02:12:28,209 --> 02:12:34,996
the outskirts of the Baumbauch Family Brewery.
There's a slight opening on the side warehouse

1707
02:12:34,996 --> 02:12:41,603
doors where you had previously worked when you
first arrived at Trostenwald, and Archivist

1708
02:12:41,603 --> 02:12:47,689
Zeenoth gestures for you to enter. "Please. If you
don't mind, my dear."

1709
02:12:47,689 --> 02:12:54,923
MARISHA: Really? Is this what got me caught,
working for these fucking assholes? Ugh. I walk in.

1710
02:12:55,767 --> 02:13:02,139
MATT: There is a single glowing lantern that is
currently hanging from a rope that is strewn

1711
02:13:02,139 --> 02:13:08,338
across the ceiling of the warehouse that gives a
central source of light to the room. It causes the

1712
02:13:08,338 --> 02:13:12,891
shadows to stretch out very long across the
sides.

1713
02:13:12,891 --> 02:13:14,755
MARISHA: What is this?

1714
02:13:14,755 --> 02:13:24,813
MATT: As you walk in and turn around, the door is
closed. The two figures approach. The female elf

1715
02:13:24,813 --> 02:13:31,815
goes and takes a chair and sets it in the center
beneath the lantern. "Please, have a seat."

1716
02:13:31,815 --> 02:13:35,658
MARISHA: I'd prefer to stand.

1717
02:13:35,658 --> 02:13:39,664
MATT: She just sits back, about 20 or so feet, and
leans against one of the large stacks of crates as

1718
02:13:39,664 --> 02:13:52,822
Zeenoth approaches you. "Now, Beauregard. You have
been what the Archive would call a problematic

1719
02:13:52,822 --> 02:13:53,972
student."

1720
02:13:53,972 --> 02:13:59,900
MARISHA: (laughter)

1721
02:13:59,900 --> 02:14:03,860
MATT: "I've had to pull in quite a bit of a
favor--"

1722
02:14:03,860 --> 02:14:13,083
MARISHA: Sorry. (laughter) Keep going. I'm
listening.

1723
02:14:13,083 --> 02:14:20,419
MATT: "Since I have been assigned to your
tutelage, overseeing your progress and training,

1724
02:14:20,419 --> 02:14:29,830
you've shown great promise, in many ways. You're a
seeker of truth, and you have a keen sense for

1725
02:14:29,830 --> 02:14:32,849
manipulations and falsehoods. Correct?"

1726
02:14:32,849 --> 02:14:35,193
MARISHA: Thanks?

1727
02:14:36,453 --> 02:14:42,104
MATT: "When the Archive took you in at the behest
of your family, you agreed to undergo our

1728
02:14:42,156 --> 02:14:45,282
discipline. Our lifestyle."

1729
02:14:45,282 --> 02:14:51,621
MARISHA: No, I didn't agree to shit. You took me
in because I'm assuming my father paid you a

1730
02:14:51,621 --> 02:14:59,725
pretty nice sum of coin to make sure that you took
me in. I'm assuming that coin is no longer coming

1731
02:14:59,725 --> 02:15:06,102
to the Reserve, so, why do you care?

1732
02:15:06,102 --> 02:15:18,436
MATT: "Believe it or not, not everyone does what
they do in this world for coin. We see possibility

1733
02:15:18,436 --> 02:15:31,764
in you. We, wish to prevent you from blowing out
your own flame. Your tendencies clash with our

1734
02:15:32,062 --> 02:15:34,576
teachings, your dislike for authority."

1735
02:15:34,576 --> 02:15:39,067
MARISHA: Yeah, I thought you guys hated me.
Thought I was doing you a favor by leaving.

1736
02:15:39,067 --> 02:15:44,900
MATT: At which point, the woman from behind says,
"Your dislike for authority is not a bad thing. It

1737
02:15:44,900 --> 02:15:52,037
can keep you alive. Authority should always be
questioned. Those with more power than you should

1738
02:15:52,037 --> 02:15:55,093
be held to a higher standard."

1739
02:15:55,093 --> 02:16:03,107
MARISHA: Thank you, authoritative figure who I am
unaware of your name?

1740
02:16:03,674 --> 02:16:10,796
MATT: At which point, Zeenoth picks up, again,
says, "But the way of the Knowing Mistress has an

1741
02:16:10,796 --> 02:16:18,805
order of learning. Your patience is essential to
adhering to this path. I know it may not be

1742
02:16:18,805 --> 02:16:26,860
stimulating at times, but we must prepare your
mind if we are ever to prepare your soul."

1743
02:16:26,860 --> 02:16:34,449
MARISHA: Yeah, I'd say that sorting books and
punching brick walls repeatedly can definitely not

1744
02:16:34,449 --> 02:16:37,455
be stimulating at all times.

1745
02:16:37,455 --> 02:16:51,236
MATT: "Look, I just wish to--" At which point, the
elven woman goes, "Enough. I've heard enough,

1746
02:16:51,236 --> 02:17:01,291
Zeenoth. You are removed of your responsibility to
oversee Beauregard." Zeenoth's eyes go wide. "This

1747
02:17:01,291 --> 02:17:09,917
is not a student you can help. Return to Zadash."
Zeenoth goes, "Expositor, I do not think that I

1748
02:17:09,917 --> 02:17:18,900
have been given a fair shot. Please--" "I know
this girl, because I see much of myself in her.

1749
02:17:18,900 --> 02:17:33,664
You cannot reach her. Go." Zeenoth looks hurt. "I
apologize that I failed you." He turns around and

1750
02:17:33,664 --> 02:17:40,367
heads back towards the warehouse doors, which
shift open, and close.

1751
02:17:40,367 --> 02:17:43,013
MARISHA: The fuck was that?

1752
02:17:43,013 --> 02:17:47,378
MATT: The woman now steps forward.

1753
02:17:47,378 --> 02:17:53,908
MARISHA: I feel like he made me look like an
asshole, feel like an asshole. Fuck, maybe I'm an

1754
02:17:53,908 --> 02:17:55,178
asshole.

1755
02:17:55,178 --> 02:18:04,567
MATT: "Maybe you're an asshole. You probably are
an asshole. That's all right, because so am I.

1756
02:18:04,567 --> 02:18:10,042
Because sometimes you need someone to be an
asshole to get shit done."

1757
02:18:10,042 --> 02:18:19,230
MARISHA: Being nice never did. What are we
talking, stranger?

1758
02:18:19,230 --> 02:18:26,122
MATT: "I am Expositor Dairon, of the Cobalt
Soul."

1759
02:18:26,122 --> 02:18:27,809
MARISHA: Dairon?

1760
02:18:27,809 --> 02:18:36,148
MATT: D-A-I-R-O-N. "I take it you have heard of
our station through whispers."

1761
02:18:36,148 --> 02:18:44,173
MARISHA: Some people like to call you boogie men.
I figured it was always real. In my opinion, the

1762
02:18:44,173 --> 02:18:49,865
best way to hide in a secret organization is by
having a boogie man.

1763
02:18:49,865 --> 02:18:55,184
MATT: "We are the hidden strength of the library,
you are not wrong. We wade in the filth of

1764
02:18:55,184 --> 02:19:03,740
society. We weed out the corrupt. We pursue the
secret evils of the world, and expose them to the

1765
02:19:03,740 --> 02:19:05,603
light."

1766
02:19:05,603 --> 02:19:06,955
MARISHA: Wow.

1767
02:19:06,955 --> 02:19:15,014
MATT: "We twist the arm of the unjust, until they
spill their mysteries. We are the spies. We are

1768
02:19:15,014 --> 02:19:25,176
the hunters. We are the watchmen to those who
rule. We are not kind. We are forthright. We are

1769
02:19:25,176 --> 02:19:32,626
truth. Do you, Beauregard, want to see the truths
of the world?"

1770
02:19:32,626 --> 02:19:42,932
MARISHA: Oh god, I'm sorry. I have this burn in my
butt from all the smoke you just blew up my ass.

1771
02:19:42,932 --> 02:19:46,883
It's just, oh god. Is that a magical talent?

1772
02:19:46,883 --> 02:19:49,661
MATT: What's your armor class?

1773
02:19:49,997 --> 02:19:52,217
MARISHA: 17.

1774
02:19:58,567 --> 02:20:06,252
MATT: You suffer ten points of bludgeoning damage
as, out of nowhere, her fist hits you right across

1775
02:20:06,504 --> 02:20:08,866
the side of your face.

1776
02:20:08,866 --> 02:20:12,276
MARISHA: It takes me to the ground. That takes me
to the ground.

1777
02:20:12,276 --> 02:20:14,008
MATT: You're unconscious?

1778
02:20:14,008 --> 02:20:17,549
MARISHA: No, just takes me to the ground.

1779
02:20:17,549 --> 02:20:21,718
MATT: Okay. "Are you listening now?"

1780
02:20:21,718 --> 02:20:25,088
MARISHA: Do I have a choice?

1781
02:20:25,088 --> 02:20:28,706
MATT: "Let me be your teacher."

1782
02:20:30,254 --> 02:20:34,601
MARISHA: Oh, boy. Is that what I have to look
forward to?

1783
02:20:35,867 --> 02:20:40,453
MATT: "No. What do you want to do now, that that's
happened?"

1784
02:20:40,453 --> 02:20:42,867
MARISHA: I kind of want to fucking punch you
back.

1785
02:20:42,867 --> 02:20:44,152
MATT: "Then do it."

1786
02:20:52,842 --> 02:20:54,679
"What's stopping you?"

1787
02:20:57,507 --> 02:21:02,120
MARISHA: Now you have my attention. And I fucking
punch her in the face!

1788
02:21:02,120 --> 02:21:04,293
MATT: Go for it. Roll for an attack.

1789
02:21:05,950 --> 02:21:07,427
MARISHA: Just a straight unarmed, right?

1790
02:21:07,427 --> 02:21:08,803
MATT: Yep.

1791
02:21:11,054 --> 02:21:14,838
MARISHA: 12 total, not good.

1792
02:21:14,838 --> 02:21:19,768
MATT: She dodges out of the way, and as you move
past, plucks you in the back of the head with a

1793
02:21:19,768 --> 02:21:25,872
knuckle. That hits. You take one point of
bludgeoning damage. It's a very light tap.

1794
02:21:25,872 --> 02:21:31,093
MARISHA: Ow! What the fuck, my dad used to do that
type of shit.

1795
02:21:31,093 --> 02:21:36,768
MATT: With that, she rushes around with a rapid
pace to the front of you, feints with an upper

1796
02:21:36,768 --> 02:21:42,246
cut, and then goes to elbow you in the side of the
head. That is a 16. What's your armor class?

1797
02:21:42,246 --> 02:21:44,593
MARISHA: That misses. 17.

1798
02:21:44,593 --> 02:21:49,339
MATT: Misses. You manage to duck out of the way of
it. She goes, "Good. Good."

1799
02:21:49,655 --> 02:21:52,217
MARISHA: I got to add some points here.

1800
02:21:52,217 --> 02:21:59,667
MATT: Okay. She's going to go ahead and use her
bonus action to go into a defensive stance.

1801
02:22:05,138 --> 02:22:06,503
"Come on."

1802
02:22:07,587 --> 02:22:14,892
MARISHA: (yells) I'm going to spend a ki point,
and go into Flurry of Blows, and do a blind

1803
02:22:14,892 --> 02:22:22,736
haymaker, a second blind haymaker, and then try
and backhand with the third. Wildly, recklessly.

1804
02:22:22,736 --> 02:22:27,164
Okay, first one. Natural 20!

1805
02:22:27,164 --> 02:22:29,133
MATT: Oh, shit!

1806
02:22:29,133 --> 02:22:33,174
MARISHA: Second one. Natural 20!

1807
02:22:33,174 --> 02:22:35,110
MATT: Two natural 20s in a row!

1808
02:22:35,110 --> 02:22:38,218
MARISHA: I don't have anyone sitting next to me to
confirm this, but I swear it's a natural 20!

1809
02:22:38,218 --> 02:22:40,142
MATT: No, I can see it!

1810
02:22:40,142 --> 02:22:44,987
MARISHA: I'll take a picture if I have to! A
natural 17.

1811
02:22:44,987 --> 02:22:47,256
MATT: Roll damage on those first two!

1812
02:22:47,256 --> 02:22:49,398
MARISHA: Okay. You double the dice, right?

1813
02:22:49,398 --> 02:22:51,371
MATT: Yeah. Roll the dice, double it.

1814
02:22:51,371 --> 02:22:57,249
MARISHA: Okay. That was a three, a two, so five,
ten plus eight. 18.

1815
02:22:57,249 --> 02:23:03,068
MATT: 18 points of damage. Then the third strike
that hit?

1816
02:23:03,370 --> 02:23:08,919
MARISHA: One, so another five points. God
fucking-- Thinking of my dad, after she just went

1817
02:23:08,919 --> 02:23:12,640
"boop," something just popping the back of my
head.

1818
02:23:12,640 --> 02:23:20,015
MATT: You watch as her defensive stance, she's
prepared for it, and as you go to swing, she lets

1819
02:23:20,015 --> 02:23:26,048
it down at the last second, and lets you get some
hits in. Wham, wham! But much stronger than she

1820
02:23:26,048 --> 02:23:31,923
expected. The first one clocks her across the
chin. The other one hits her across the temple.

1821
02:23:31,923 --> 02:23:32,860
The last one--

1822
02:23:32,860 --> 02:23:34,478
MARISHA: Just a wild backhand.

1823
02:23:34,478 --> 02:23:38,172
MATT: Just hits her in the back of the head. She
stumbles for a second, then spins around. You can

1824
02:23:38,172 --> 02:23:41,424
see a bit of blood trickling out of the corner of
her mouth, and there's a little bit of a scrape of

1825
02:23:41,424 --> 02:23:49,742
dirt on the side her head where you hit. She turns
around. "Very good. You have learned some things

1826
02:23:49,742 --> 02:24:03,459
in your time." She quickly advances on you. Hits.
18, hits. Okay. You take three points of

1827
02:24:03,459 --> 02:24:09,549
bludgeoning damage, one per hit. Pop! Pop pop! She
is basically going full in with the strike, and is

1828
02:24:09,549 --> 02:24:16,047
just prodding you with these gentle little hits,
showing control, showing that she's entirely able

1829
02:24:16,047 --> 02:24:22,128
to overwhelm you, and she's hitting different
places on your body, strategically. Because with

1830
02:24:22,128 --> 02:24:26,080
each hit, you feel this burst of numbness in those
vicinities. I need you to make a constitution

1831
02:24:26,080 --> 02:24:27,910
saving throw.

1832
02:24:31,258 --> 02:24:36,022
MARISHA: Not great. That's a natural seven, so ten
total.

1833
02:24:36,022 --> 02:24:43,031
MATT: Okay. After each hit, you gather yourself
for a second, she stops and goes, "You are quick,

1834
02:24:43,031 --> 02:24:55,336
and there is intelligence lying in there. You are
also quite nimble at dodging blows. Do you see,

1835
02:24:55,336 --> 02:25:02,463
with but a few simple strikes, I'm able to extract
from you everything I need to know about you."

1836
02:25:02,463 --> 02:25:07,740
MARISHA: What the fuck, why can't I feel my hand?
What did you do?

1837
02:25:07,740 --> 02:25:16,597
MATT: "You see, brute force has its place. But
precision, and intent. That can take down the

1838
02:25:16,597 --> 02:25:24,094
greatest of mountains, by poking the weakest
point. Now, I know where your weak points are."

1839
02:25:25,052 --> 02:25:28,684
MARISHA: You don't know shit about me, bitch. I'm
going to take another attack.

1840
02:25:28,684 --> 02:25:30,692
MATT: Go for it.

1841
02:25:34,020 --> 02:25:36,850
MARISHA: That's a three. That's a nine.

1842
02:25:36,850 --> 02:25:44,214
MATT: Nope. With each miss, or, the first miss,
she's going to use a reaction to attack you.

1843
02:25:44,214 --> 02:25:51,686
That's going to be-- She can do that. Ducks out of
the way, and immediately uses a reaction to smack

1844
02:25:51,686 --> 02:25:56,108
you in the head for one point of damage, another
bludgeoning point. She's going to spend another ki

1845
02:25:56,108 --> 02:26:00,051
point to do another reaction. She can also do
that.

1846
02:26:00,051 --> 02:26:05,644
MARISHA: Roll. I rolled a 15 to attack. Second
attack. These are two attacks, right?

1847
02:26:05,644 --> 02:26:07,104
MATT: For your second one, yeah.

1848
02:26:07,104 --> 02:26:09,046
MARISHA: 15, so, 21.

1849
02:26:09,046 --> 02:26:13,094
MATT: Yeah, the second one does hit. She does not
get the second attack. Roll damage on that second

1850
02:26:13,094 --> 02:26:14,638
strike.

1851
02:26:14,638 --> 02:26:20,072
MARISHA: Okay. Attacking her with the first one,
and then I'm just going to duck down a little and

1852
02:26:20,072 --> 02:26:22,041
jab her right in the ribs.

1853
02:26:22,041 --> 02:26:24,646
MATT: All right. What was the damage on that?

1854
02:26:24,646 --> 02:26:27,657
MARISHA: Eight.

1855
02:26:27,657 --> 02:26:32,313
MATT: Eight damage, nice. You crack her in the
ribs, and the impact actually does catch her off

1856
02:26:32,313 --> 02:26:36,604
guard. She ends up tumbling five feet backward
across the ground, catching herself in a

1857
02:26:36,604 --> 02:26:39,064
three-point landing.

1858
02:26:39,064 --> 02:26:45,660
MARISHA: I back up. I'm going to spend another ki
point to do my defensive stance. Patient defense.

1859
02:26:45,660 --> 02:26:49,622
MATT: Okay. Patient defense. You go into that
stance that she was in earlier, but holding it for

1860
02:26:49,622 --> 02:26:53,461
the entirety of this. Her eyes narrow for a
second. You see her looking at all the different

1861
02:26:53,461 --> 02:26:58,264
points that she struck on you earlier, like she's
reading some sort of a docket on what your

1862
02:26:58,264 --> 02:27:03,622
physicality is. With that, she doesn't run at you,
she runs around you in a circle and begins to jump

1863
02:27:03,622 --> 02:27:08,727
off the sides of the boxes, some of the crates
that are stacked up nearby. You watch them wiggle

1864
02:27:08,727 --> 02:27:11,958
as she puts her weight up against them, leaps
off--

1865
02:27:11,958 --> 02:27:16,219
MARISHA: Instead of getting distracted by her, I
just listen to her and look at her out of my

1866
02:27:16,219 --> 02:27:17,678
periphery.

1867
02:27:17,678 --> 02:27:21,981
MATT: Okay. Eventually, she uses her momentum to
climb to the top with her feet and leap off, then

1868
02:27:21,981 --> 02:27:24,856
come downward with the knee towards you.

1869
02:27:24,856 --> 02:27:29,256
MARISHA: Right as she comes down and I'm going to
use-- Oh, wait, dodge? Go first?

1870
02:27:29,256 --> 02:27:33,129
MATT: You're already in your defensive stance, so
her attack's at disadvantage against you. The

1871
02:27:33,129 --> 02:27:39,120
first strike. 19, 20 to hit?

1872
02:27:39,120 --> 02:27:44,098
MARISHA: Miss. It says patient defense, spend one
ki point to take the dodge action as a bonus

1873
02:27:44,098 --> 02:27:45,895
action on my turn.

1874
02:27:45,895 --> 02:27:48,640
MATT: Correct, what the dodge action does is it
means any attacks against you have disadvantage.

1875
02:27:48,640 --> 02:27:49,946
MARISHA: Oh. Cool.

1876
02:27:49,946 --> 02:27:56,342
MATT: The first one did hit. Second one does not.
The third one does. Two hits still get you. Both

1877
02:27:56,342 --> 02:28:03,669
one point of bludgeoning damage. The knee comes
down, and right as it cracks into your head, she

1878
02:28:03,669 --> 02:28:08,614
shifts to the side and glides off, and as soon as
her body glides off, her back is to yours, and her

1879
02:28:08,614 --> 02:28:14,277
spinning elbow goes and cracks you in the side of
the head, but it stops short, just barely hitting

1880
02:28:14,277 --> 02:28:16,858
you. She's toying with you at this point.

1881
02:28:16,858 --> 02:28:18,626
MARISHA: You said two more points?

1882
02:28:18,626 --> 02:28:21,911
MATT: Yes, two more points of bludgeoning damage.
Make another constitution saving throw, please.

1883
02:28:26,061 --> 02:28:28,509
MARISHA: 11. No, sorry, 12.

1884
02:28:28,895 --> 02:28:34,084
MATT: This time, opposed to the pressure points
being hit, there is the one smack on the side of

1885
02:28:34,084 --> 02:28:35,167
your head.

1886
02:28:35,167 --> 02:28:36,840
MARISHA: Yeah?

1887
02:28:36,840 --> 02:28:41,344
MATT: This pain surges through the side of your
temple, and travels through your spine, to all the

1888
02:28:41,344 --> 02:28:46,719
points she had hit earlier, and your whole body
tenses and seizes for a second. Your vision blurs,

1889
02:28:46,719 --> 02:28:53,728
and your mouth stammers, and you're stunned for
the next round. As she lands behind you, and walks

1890
02:28:53,728 --> 02:29:05,471
around to the front of you, you're unable to, you
can't move, you can't speak. "I can start you on

1891
02:29:05,471 --> 02:29:16,411
this path. You can return to your wanderlust, your
allies. Our kind learns more in the world than in

1892
02:29:16,411 --> 02:29:25,852
a library. Agree to my instruction, to use the
skills I teach you, as you return throughout your

1893
02:29:25,852 --> 02:29:35,946
journeys. One day, you too, can become an
expositor." You begin to regain control of your

1894
02:29:35,946 --> 02:29:39,791
senses, and your speech begins to slowly return to
you.

1895
02:29:44,273 --> 02:29:55,738
MARISHA: Okay. I got to hand it to you, that was
awesome, and I want to know how to do that. You

1896
02:29:55,738 --> 02:29:57,161
beat me.

1897
02:29:57,161 --> 02:30:02,001
MATT: "Very well. Your first lesson begins now."

1898
02:30:03,165 --> 02:30:06,161
MARISHA: Okay. (groan)

1899
02:30:06,161 --> 02:30:17,096
MATT: She snaps her fingers, and you watch as
Zeenoth steps back in, sheepishly. "Is it over, my

1900
02:30:17,096 --> 02:30:27,784
dear? Is it done?" "I need you to stand here for a
second, Zeenoth. I need a body. Let me show you

1901
02:30:27,784 --> 02:30:34,622
the proper pressure points." Zeenoth's eyes go
wide for a second. "I don't believe--" "You owe me

1902
02:30:34,622 --> 02:30:46,804
a favor. I found her for you, did I not?" Zeenoth
sighs, sags his head, and takes his cloak off.

1903
02:30:46,804 --> 02:30:54,189
MARISHA: I grab that stool, and I drag it over.

1904
02:30:54,189 --> 02:31:01,675
MATT: "Now, depending on what you wish to learn,
there are different places where you can pull the

1905
02:31:01,675 --> 02:31:12,158
information from the body." Over the next few
hours, working with you, and over time--

1906
02:31:12,158 --> 02:31:13,843
MARISHA: Does she beat the shit out of Zeenoth?

1907
02:31:13,843 --> 02:31:15,578
MATT: You both do.

1908
02:31:16,269 --> 02:31:22,201
MARISHA: Sorry, Zeenoth. Sorry. God, we're such
assholes.

1909
02:31:22,201 --> 02:31:25,648
MATT: "Assholes that the world needs, from time to
time."

1910
02:31:25,648 --> 02:31:32,695
MARISHA: Yeah. The world does need an asshole.
We'll work on that one together. We'll work on

1911
02:31:32,695 --> 02:31:36,108
that. That's good, that's good.

1912
02:31:36,108 --> 02:31:40,491
MATT: "I'll return to Zadash in the morning. Take
what I have taught you. "When you feel it's time

1913
02:31:40,491 --> 02:31:46,048
for more tutelage, return to me. Do not worry. I
have an eye on you."

1914
02:31:46,048 --> 02:31:49,827
MARISHA: What do I do until then, do I just
continue--

1915
02:31:49,827 --> 02:31:55,287
MATT: "Do what you must. Travel the world. Use
what I've taught you. Learn about injustice. Those

1916
02:31:55,287 --> 02:32:03,287
you don't trust, follow them. Bend them. Make them
tell the truth and admit their guilt. Find where

1917
02:32:03,287 --> 02:32:10,921
ever corruption is. Root it out and let the system
do its job. If the system isn't doing its job,

1918
02:32:10,921 --> 02:32:13,971
destroy the system."

1919
02:32:15,080 --> 02:32:19,138
MARISHA: Why are you doing this? Why me?

1920
02:32:19,138 --> 02:32:25,104
MATT: "Because a long time ago, I was a wayward
girl with no direction, was angry, and fighting at

1921
02:32:25,104 --> 02:32:30,695
the world. And someone did this for me."

1922
02:32:30,695 --> 02:32:38,969
MARISHA: I don't really believe in systems or
being a part of them, let alone a system that

1923
02:32:38,969 --> 02:32:44,803
takes down other systems. Seems almost
hypocritical.

1924
02:32:44,803 --> 02:32:54,557
MATT: "Perhaps. Who knows. Maybe one day you'll
find the corruption inside our own."

1925
02:32:57,262 --> 02:32:59,312
MARISHA: Touche.

1926
02:32:59,312 --> 02:33:04,962
MATT: "Go. Get some rest. Clean up a bit, I think
you could use it."

1927
02:33:04,962 --> 02:33:06,790
MARISHA: You might have broke my wrist.

1928
02:33:06,790 --> 02:33:15,035
MATT: "It'll heal. Zeenoth." She slaps him awake.
His unconscious body on the ground.

1929
02:33:15,650 --> 02:33:18,617
MARISHA: Bye, Zeenoth! Zeenoth!

1930
02:33:18,617 --> 02:33:20,369
MATT: (coughing)

1931
02:33:20,369 --> 02:33:22,232
MARISHA: Zeenoth!

1932
02:33:22,232 --> 02:33:24,475
MATT: "Oh dear."

1933
02:33:24,475 --> 02:33:26,809
MARISHA: Bye.

1934
02:33:26,809 --> 02:33:32,534
MATT: "Goodbye. I have such great pleasure in
saying goodbye, and good riddance."

1935
02:33:32,534 --> 02:33:35,537
MARISHA: I leave.

1936
02:33:35,537 --> 02:33:42,820
MATT: You make your way back to the tavern, go
back into the room, and, exhaustedly, pass out.

1937
02:33:45,051 --> 02:33:47,490
Let's bring everyone else back in.

1938
02:34:01,059 --> 02:34:04,076
MARISHA: Hi, friends. How's it going?

1939
02:34:04,864 --> 02:34:06,634
TRAVIS: Are you alive?

1940
02:34:06,634 --> 02:34:09,880
LIAM: I'm sure everything went according to plan.

1941
02:34:09,880 --> 02:34:12,258
TALIESIN: Quiet dignity and grace.

1942
02:34:12,258 --> 02:34:18,977
MATT: As you all come to consciousness in the
morning, little sore, but recovered--mostly--from

1943
02:34:18,977 --> 02:34:28,439
the battle that wrecked you the evening before.
The fresh smells of cooked meats, and the sounds

1944
02:34:28,439 --> 02:34:37,716
of various patrons below in the inn tavern floor,
rouse you to the morning. What do you wish to do?

1945
02:34:37,716 --> 02:34:41,456
LIAM: Ah--

1946
02:34:43,820 --> 02:34:47,397
MARISHA: Hi, guys. Sorry I snuck in last night.

1947
02:34:47,397 --> 02:34:49,709
TRAVIS: How does she look?

1948
02:34:49,709 --> 02:34:51,125
MATT: She's beat to shit.

1949
02:34:51,125 --> 02:34:55,603
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck! Did you get horse kicked?

1950
02:34:57,565 --> 02:34:59,517
MARISHA: Several times.

1951
02:34:59,517 --> 02:35:01,953
TRAVIS: Damn. How's the horse look?

1952
02:35:01,953 --> 02:35:05,258
MARISHA: Horse is fucking dead. I ate it.

1953
02:35:05,258 --> 02:35:08,583
TRAVIS: That's a bit excessive.

1954
02:35:08,583 --> 02:35:15,660
MARISHA: Horse is fucking fine. Hey, Jester, do
you have a bandage? Do you have a thing?

1955
02:35:15,660 --> 02:35:23,893
LAURA: Oh, yes! Of course I do. I have a lot of
bandages because I am the cleric.

1956
02:35:23,893 --> 02:35:26,924
TRAVIS: I don't know if that bone's supposed to be
sticking out of that part.

1957
02:35:26,924 --> 02:35:33,941
LAURA: Yes, I'm going to open the medical kit and
rummage around. Pull out some stuff. Give me your

1958
02:35:33,941 --> 02:35:36,708
wrist! I can definitely heal this.

1959
02:35:36,708 --> 02:35:38,744
TRAVIS: I bet Yasha can pop it back into place.

1960
02:35:38,744 --> 02:35:40,957
MARISHA: Yeah, <i>crack</i>.

1961
02:35:40,957 --> 02:35:44,042
MATT: Make a medicine check.

1962
02:35:44,042 --> 02:35:45,768
TRAVIS: You just made a bow.

1963
02:35:45,768 --> 02:35:47,952
TALIESIN: It was string and mime.

1964
02:35:47,952 --> 02:35:49,773
MARISHA: Oh, you made it worse!

1965
02:35:49,773 --> 02:35:51,438
LIAM: (blood gushing)

1966
02:35:51,438 --> 02:35:52,903
LAURA: 20.

1967
02:35:52,903 --> 02:35:55,379
MATT: Okay. It's actually fairly well made; it
gives some nice support to it. I mean, it's more

1968
02:35:55,379 --> 02:36:00,617
of a sprain than a break. But it helps offer some
support to it. It'll heal.

1969
02:36:00,617 --> 02:36:02,499
MARISHA: I've had some sprains that feel like
breaks.

1970
02:36:02,499 --> 02:36:06,107
MATT: Yeah, no, it hurts like a bitch, or it did
last night. Or it feels a little better today, but

1971
02:36:06,107 --> 02:36:08,897
that's definitely going to help give it some
support. Good job.

1972
02:36:08,897 --> 02:36:10,588
MARISHA: Thank you.

1973
02:36:10,588 --> 02:36:11,650
ASHLEY: What happened to you?

1974
02:36:11,650 --> 02:36:12,959
LAURA: I've been practicing.

1975
02:36:12,959 --> 02:36:15,828
TRAVIS: Not you, her. What happened to <i>her</i>?

1976
02:36:15,828 --> 02:36:18,841
LAURA: Oh. Sorry.

1977
02:36:18,841 --> 02:36:27,717
MARISHA: Man, it was a great night. I had a great
night! I haven't had a great night in a long time,

1978
02:36:27,717 --> 02:36:29,994
you guys. That was a great night.

1979
02:36:29,994 --> 02:36:31,394
TRAVIS: With the guy you--

1980
02:36:31,394 --> 02:36:33,128
LAURA: You came in really late.

1981
02:36:33,128 --> 02:36:35,174
TALIESIN: I'd like to see the other guy.

1982
02:36:35,174 --> 02:36:41,291
MARISHA: I might have been accepted into, like, a
secret society. It's kind of secret society

1983
02:36:41,291 --> 02:36:43,844
business. It's hard to talk about.

1984
02:36:43,844 --> 02:36:47,770
LAURA: Are you allowed to talk about it? Tell us
about it!

1985
02:36:47,770 --> 02:37:02,064
MARISHA: Okay! No, I can't. It's fine. There are
these monks. I thought they hated me. It turns out

1986
02:37:02,064 --> 02:37:07,528
they like me. Turns out they want me to become a
part of their gang. But it's not really real, and

1987
02:37:07,528 --> 02:37:13,611
they're like, "Just keep doing your thing! But
you're against injustice and seek out truth and

1988
02:37:13,611 --> 02:37:15,477
break systems!"

1989
02:37:15,477 --> 02:37:17,032
LAURA: You are a hero!

1990
02:37:17,032 --> 02:37:20,854
LIAM: Is this one of those dreams where nobody has
their clothes on?

1991
02:37:20,854 --> 02:37:24,020
TALIESIN: You know, if the monks beat you up to
make them join your gang, they're not really your

1992
02:37:24,020 --> 02:37:26,284
friends.

1993
02:37:26,284 --> 02:37:35,063
MARISHA: You know, I said something like that to
her. It wasn't as black and white as that.

1994
02:37:35,063 --> 02:37:38,625
TALIESIN: Is that why they did that to your face
there? Oh, no, they didn't. Apparently they were

1995
02:37:38,625 --> 02:37:39,707
pretty--

1996
02:37:39,707 --> 02:37:45,118
MARISHA: I wouldn't say this woman was my friend.
I would say she's definitely a badass. I wouldn't

1997
02:37:45,118 --> 02:37:47,400
say she's my friend.

1998
02:37:47,400 --> 02:37:50,328
TRAVIS: This woman, was she with the fellow that
you left with last night?

1999
02:37:50,328 --> 02:37:54,798
MARISHA: She was. His name was Zeenoth. He's an
archivist of the Cobalt Reserve. Lot of books

2000
02:37:54,798 --> 02:37:56,249
there. Lot of books.

2001
02:37:56,249 --> 02:37:58,012
TRAVIS: Cobalt Reserve. He was in the court.

2002
02:37:58,012 --> 02:38:00,859
ASHLEY: Was this a test of some sort?

2003
02:38:00,859 --> 02:38:03,500
MARISHA: I think so.

2004
02:38:03,500 --> 02:38:08,644
LAURA: Did you pass? I mean, they made you a hero,
so obviously you did.

2005
02:38:08,644 --> 02:38:16,242
MARISHA: I'm not a hero. That's not what they did.
It's more like a vigilante! Like what we said!

2006
02:38:16,242 --> 02:38:18,293
Yeah!

2007
02:38:18,293 --> 02:38:24,236
LAURA: This is so great. Can they let us into the
secret society too?

2008
02:38:24,236 --> 02:38:26,396
MARISHA: No.

2009
02:38:26,773 --> 02:38:31,872
LIAM: Well, you know, this is very fascinating,
but I have some errands to run. Nott, would you

2010
02:38:31,872 --> 02:38:38,333
like to run errands with me? We are totally coming
back and not leaving on our own undercover.

2011
02:38:38,333 --> 02:38:41,909
TRAVIS, LAURA, and TALIESIN: Insight check.

2012
02:38:42,391 --> 02:38:44,615
LIAM: Bring it on.

2013
02:38:44,615 --> 02:38:47,888
MARISHA: Do you need an insight check to know that
that was shady as fuck?

2014
02:38:47,888 --> 02:38:49,075
TALIESIN: Fuck all.

2015
02:38:49,075 --> 02:38:50,121
LAURA: 15.

2016
02:38:50,121 --> 02:38:52,065
TRAVIS: 11.

2017
02:38:52,065 --> 02:38:53,283
LIAM: Persuasion?

2018
02:38:53,283 --> 02:38:54,261
TALIESIN: 11.

2019
02:38:54,261 --> 02:38:56,294
MATT: You don't have to tell me what you're
rolling!

2020
02:38:56,294 --> 02:39:00,848
LIAM: I rolled a natural 20! Whatever. I'm being
very honest! We're not going anywhere. But I do

2021
02:39:00,848 --> 02:39:07,045
have errands to run. So, we're going to leave
soon. Have some breakfast. I grab some bacon from

2022
02:39:07,045 --> 02:39:13,072
Ford/Fjord's plate, and grab Nott and head out the
door.

2023
02:39:13,072 --> 02:39:15,901
TALIESIN: Meet us at the circus.

2024
02:39:15,901 --> 02:39:25,961
LAURA: I'm going to draw in my sketchbook a
drawing of the devil toad head rolling along the

2025
02:39:25,961 --> 02:39:28,970
ground like a bowling ball.

2026
02:39:28,970 --> 02:39:31,794
SAM and TALIESIN: She really did.

2027
02:39:31,794 --> 02:39:39,557
LAURA: Well, kind of. I put the little bowling
ball things on there. And he's going to run into

2028
02:39:39,557 --> 02:39:45,985
all of us, in chains, being knocked down like
pins.

2029
02:39:45,985 --> 02:39:54,336
MATT: Okay. Roll a dexterity check. Why not?

2030
02:39:56,988 --> 02:39:58,616
LAURA: Eight-- No, 15.

2031
02:39:58,616 --> 02:40:03,605
MATT: It's very well done. There's, like, hatch
mark shading.

2032
02:40:03,605 --> 02:40:09,288
LAURA: Well, I did get really good training, so
it's good that I know how to do shading.

2033
02:40:09,643 --> 02:40:13,410
MATT: All right, what are you guys doing? The rest
of you, while they rush off to go about their

2034
02:40:13,410 --> 02:40:14,670
errands.

2035
02:40:14,670 --> 02:40:18,240
TRAVIS: Apparently eating less of my bacon,
motherfucker.

2036
02:40:19,539 --> 02:40:23,446
TALIESIN: I'm going to pack up and head back to
the circus. Start getting things together.

2037
02:40:23,446 --> 02:40:26,559
ASHLEY: Yeah. I think I'll join you.

2038
02:40:26,559 --> 02:40:30,627
MATT: Molly and Yasha are heading back to the
carnival grounds.

2039
02:40:30,627 --> 02:40:33,836
LAURA: I want to go try to buy a map.

2040
02:40:33,836 --> 02:40:34,966
MARISHA: That's a good idea.

2041
02:40:34,966 --> 02:40:36,228
LAURA: Yeah!

2042
02:40:36,228 --> 02:40:38,466
ASHLEY: Oh, I did actually want to see that map.

2043
02:40:38,466 --> 02:40:44,174
TALIESIN: I'll meet you there. Actually, you know
what? I want to see you see that map.

2044
02:40:45,113 --> 02:40:49,664
ASHLEY: I think that's a great idea. Seeing me see
a map is something pretty special.

2045
02:40:49,664 --> 02:40:52,581
TALIESIN: It's gorgeous. It's fabulous.

2046
02:40:52,581 --> 02:40:56,490
MATT: You guys, where are you heading off to?

2047
02:40:56,490 --> 02:41:02,117
LIAM: I have two places to go. The first, we're
going to the Burnished Bibelots. The second is a

2048
02:41:02,117 --> 02:41:07,751
surprise. But I know that I whisked you away in a
hurry the other day and you weren't done

2049
02:41:07,812 --> 02:41:09,664
browsing.

2050
02:41:09,664 --> 02:41:13,980
SAM: That sounds lovely and I would like to browse
there again, but, honestly, Caleb, I am very

2051
02:41:13,980 --> 02:41:22,248
worried about you. You have passed out twice in
the last few days, and unless we get you a healing

2052
02:41:22,248 --> 02:41:29,849
potion, there is no promise that you will still be
alive tomorrow. I think we should go to Natural

2053
02:41:29,849 --> 02:41:35,503
Remedies. You distract the owner while I go in the
back and I steal a healing potion. It's the only

2054
02:41:35,503 --> 02:41:38,386
way to guarantee your safety.

2055
02:41:38,386 --> 02:41:44,518
LIAM: Maybe that's the third place that we go. I
will point out your point, which was that these

2056
02:41:44,518 --> 02:41:49,339
crazy bastards are very distracting and strange,
yeah?

2057
02:41:49,339 --> 02:41:50,887
SAM: Yes!

2058
02:41:50,887 --> 02:41:58,458
LIAM: So they could be my healing potion, you
know? We'll talk about it. Third place. So, drag

2059
02:41:58,458 --> 02:42:02,032
her off to the Burnished Bibelots. Boom, in the
door.

2060
02:42:02,032 --> 02:42:09,775
MATT: You head inside. It looks as chaotic as you
left it. You see what looks to be a small bowl of

2061
02:42:09,775 --> 02:42:17,885
heated porridge that's gathered on the counter,
and cross-legged on top is the fantastic gnomish

2062
02:42:17,885 --> 02:42:24,389
purveyor of the interior, Oglen. "Hello?"

2063
02:42:24,389 --> 02:42:26,592
LIAM: Good day to you, sir!

2064
02:42:26,592 --> 02:42:28,852
MATT: "Good day to you as well."

2065
02:42:28,852 --> 02:42:33,606
LIAM: I give Nott a little shove over towards the
shelves and walk up to him, right up to the

2066
02:42:33,606 --> 02:42:37,712
counter. What are you eating there? That looks
good.

2067
02:42:37,712 --> 02:42:40,606
MATT: "Breakfast."

2068
02:42:40,606 --> 02:42:47,708
LIAM: All right, yeah. That's what that is. You
know, I wanted to thank you for the book. I don't

2069
02:42:47,708 --> 02:42:52,017
know if you read it yourself, but I read it cover
to cover quickly. It was fascinating and very

2070
02:42:52,017 --> 02:42:54,626
useful. 
[aside, quietly] <i>I hope you're doing stuff over there.</i>

2071
02:42:54,673 --> 02:42:56,864
MATT: "All sales are final!"

2072
02:42:56,864 --> 02:43:05,388
LIAM: Well, here's the thing. I have read this
book and loved it, and if you would like to

2073
02:43:05,388 --> 02:43:13,657
purchase it for the low, low price of one gold,
you can sell it again. You sold it to me for

2074
02:43:13,657 --> 02:43:18,449
three. You have it back for one. You can turn a
profit.

2075
02:43:18,449 --> 02:43:20,660
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

2076
02:43:22,908 --> 02:43:25,299
LIAM: Natural 20.

2077
02:43:25,712 --> 02:43:28,903
MATT: You watch as some of the porridge is
spilling out the side of his mouth, and he rubs it

2078
02:43:28,903 --> 02:43:39,109
off. "All right." And he pulls a gold coin out of
his pouch.

2079
02:43:42,709 --> 02:43:49,127
LIAM: That is a good decision, and it was a good
book. I am grateful for the knowledge you have

2080
02:43:49,136 --> 02:43:50,601
imparted upon me.

2081
02:43:50,601 --> 02:43:52,398
MATT: "Might I have the book?"

2082
02:43:52,398 --> 02:43:57,432
LIAM: Oh, of course! It's right here on the table.
Sorry, grandfather.

2083
02:43:57,432 --> 02:44:00,028
MATT: "All sales are final."

2084
02:44:00,028 --> 02:44:03,609
LIAM: Right. You will not sell that back to me,
for sure.

2085
02:44:03,609 --> 02:44:09,085
MATT: "Do you want it? I can sell it to you for
three gold."

2086
02:44:09,085 --> 02:44:13,325
LIAM: That's a good price. Nott, how are you
doing?

2087
02:44:13,325 --> 02:44:18,822
SAM: (chewing) Bacon's really good!

2088
02:44:18,822 --> 02:44:20,638
LIAM: All done for the day?

2089
02:44:20,638 --> 02:44:24,041
SAM: I'm looking around for something to swipe.

2090
02:44:24,041 --> 02:44:28,775
MATT: Make an investigation check. You guys keep
just shaking down this poor gnome guy.

2091
02:44:28,775 --> 02:44:29,989
SAM: Ten.

2092
02:44:29,989 --> 02:44:35,944
MATT: Looking around, I mean, a lot of this is
knick-knacks and inane garbage, and things that

2093
02:44:35,944 --> 02:44:46,149
just aren't quite worth what you'd be looking for.
You do find one art piece that looks like it's a

2094
02:44:46,149 --> 02:44:51,098
pretty good art piece with a decent frame, might
be worth a little bit, but that's the best you can

2095
02:44:51,098 --> 02:44:56,309
find. Everything else here looks like it's the
dingy side of the Salvation Army.

2096
02:44:56,309 --> 02:45:04,918
SAM: Anything small? Ooh! Can I find my old flask
that I left here?

2097
02:45:04,918 --> 02:45:08,512
MATT: Yes, I'll let you do that. It has not moved
from where you placed it.

2098
02:45:08,512 --> 02:45:11,272
SAM: I'm going to steal back my old flask.

2099
02:45:11,272 --> 02:45:13,347
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check, please.

2100
02:45:13,347 --> 02:45:18,791
LIAM: What is that little dancer toy? Between the
three red mushrooms on the shelf behind you, is

2101
02:45:18,791 --> 02:45:21,616
that a music box there?

2102
02:45:21,616 --> 02:45:25,989
MATT: "It is a music box." 
He takes it and cranks it.

2103
02:45:26,475 --> 02:45:28,353
SAM: 24.

2104
02:45:28,353 --> 02:45:30,742
MATT: "It was a music box."

2105
02:45:30,742 --> 02:45:32,737
LIAM: It's lost the magic.

2106
02:45:32,737 --> 02:45:34,833
MATT: "I can fix it."

2107
02:45:34,833 --> 02:45:37,245
LIAM: How long would that take?

2108
02:45:37,245 --> 02:45:42,945
MATT: He breaks it open, looks inside. "Three
days."

2109
02:45:42,945 --> 02:45:49,888
LIAM: Okay. Well, I'll come back and see your work
in three days. Work on that and your breakfast.

2110
02:45:49,888 --> 02:45:53,253
Hey Nott, are you ready?

2111
02:45:53,253 --> 02:45:54,839
SAM: Mm-hmm!

2112
02:45:54,839 --> 02:45:57,470
LIAM: All right. Good day to you. Happy sales.

2113
02:45:57,470 --> 02:46:00,032
MATT: "Happy sales, as well."

2114
02:46:00,032 --> 02:46:03,466
LIAM: Sure. Out the door.

2115
02:46:03,466 --> 02:46:06,298
SAM: I rolled a 24.

2116
02:46:06,298 --> 02:46:08,826
MATT: Yeah, he did not notice at all.

2117
02:46:08,826 --> 02:46:14,549
LIAM: I'm going to head in the direction, dragging
my goblin friend with me, to that fancy bathhouse

2118
02:46:14,549 --> 02:46:19,852
that was described to me last night at the Nestled
Nook.

2119
02:46:19,852 --> 02:46:28,959
MATT: You guys make your way southward. Go ahead
and make a general charisma check.

2120
02:46:28,959 --> 02:46:34,356
LIAM: Charisma check? Well, something I wanted to
do before we got there, was going to do it maybe

2121
02:46:34,356 --> 02:46:43,698
in an alley, but you tell me, is I would like to
cast Disguise Self on myself. Presumably gone into

2122
02:46:43,698 --> 02:46:48,486
an alleyway so no one sees me doing this in the
middle of the road. I take the form of a man in

2123
02:46:48,486 --> 02:46:55,978
very fancy green robes, beautiful blond hair, very
handsome man, with a vomit stain down the front of

2124
02:46:55,978 --> 02:46:57,470
my clothes.

2125
02:46:57,470 --> 02:47:01,319
MATT: Okay. Specific and easily done.

2126
02:47:01,319 --> 02:47:09,203
LIAM: I drag my little friend along with me. You
are going to like this, this is something very special.

2127
02:47:09,203 --> 02:47:10,798
SAM: I'm excited.

2128
02:47:10,798 --> 02:47:16,702
LIAM: Oh, charisma check. Straight charisma?

2129
02:47:16,702 --> 02:47:18,375
MATT: Straight charisma. Add your modifier.

2130
02:47:18,375 --> 02:47:20,455
LIAM: Yeah, it's 11.

2131
02:47:20,455 --> 02:47:26,636
MATT: 11, okay. With your Disguise Self form, it's
easy enough for you to ask a few questions, and

2132
02:47:26,636 --> 02:47:35,520
eventually you are given directions to what is
called the Warm Dew Bathhouse. Warm Dew.

2133
02:47:35,520 --> 02:47:37,635
LAURA: Warm Doo, D-O-O.

2134
02:47:37,635 --> 02:47:39,568
MATT: D-E-W.

2135
02:47:39,568 --> 02:47:42,482
LIAM: Dew, dew. There's a liquid u in that.

2136
02:47:42,482 --> 02:47:45,435
TRAVIS: Warm doo. Thank you.

2137
02:47:45,435 --> 02:47:49,154
MATT: It'll be one before you bathe there and the
other when you leave.

2138
02:47:49,154 --> 02:47:52,511
(laughter)

2139
02:47:52,511 --> 02:47:55,339
LIAM: All right, let's enter this establishment.

2140
02:47:55,339 --> 02:48:01,847
MATT: For as far south as this is, it's pretty
decent compared to the other areas. Most of the

2141
02:48:01,847 --> 02:48:06,900
Hillsward-- you get the sense that a lot of the
rural farming community that fills out most of

2142
02:48:06,900 --> 02:48:13,207
Trostenwald, a lot of the money that gets made
goes directly to the central portion of this ward,

2143
02:48:13,207 --> 02:48:17,723
where this bathhouse is. It's small, but it's
really well put together. As you walk inside, you

2144
02:48:17,723 --> 02:48:24,813
can see there are marble busts set on the sides of the
entrance way, each side. You can see nice

2145
02:48:24,813 --> 02:48:32,878
tapestries that are pulled back over the windows,
and as both of you walk in, you see this young

2146
02:48:32,878 --> 02:48:45,555
man, maybe his mid-twenties or so. Human, but he
looks very thin and sickly, like he had a rough

2147
02:48:45,555 --> 02:48:51,059
upbringing, and his general constitution has
suffered for it. He has a warm smile, and he's

2148
02:48:51,059 --> 02:48:55,828
wearing these long white robes with what looks to
be a yellowish scarf that's wrapped around as he

2149
02:48:55,828 --> 02:48:59,184
approaches. "Hello and good morning. Can I help
you?"

2150
02:48:59,184 --> 02:49:06,145
LIAM: Yes, one moment. (quietly) Stay close to me
and let me do the talking. (louder) Hello, please,

2151
02:49:06,145 --> 02:49:10,085
don't focus-- my daughter is shy.

2152
02:49:10,085 --> 02:49:12,339
MATT: "I'm very sorry."

2153
02:49:12,339 --> 02:49:19,143
LIAM: I've had a terrible day. Some disgusting
derelict has vomited all over me, I smell like

2154
02:49:19,143 --> 02:49:25,294
filth, and I would like to spend a couple of hours
in your finest bath. Maybe not your finest. A good

2155
02:49:25,294 --> 02:49:34,437
bath, for a couple of hours. My daughter and I. I
will need adjoining baths, if you have that. For

2156
02:49:34,437 --> 02:49:37,175
modesty's sake, my daughter and I.

2157
02:49:37,175 --> 02:49:40,324
MATT: "That can be done. Of course." Make a
persuasion check.

2158
02:49:40,324 --> 02:49:48,228
LIAM: (humming) There's a 12.

2159
02:49:48,228 --> 02:49:57,510
MATT: "For two hours, that will run-- for two
baths adjoining, we'll put it at eight silver pieces."

2160
02:49:57,510 --> 02:50:02,192
LIAM: That's fine. I definitely have that. I take
out the eight silver, I slap it down.

2161
02:50:02,192 --> 02:50:04,790
MATT: "Wonderful. We'll show you to your
bathroom."

2162
02:50:04,790 --> 02:50:08,064
LIAM: Okay. Come along, dear.

2163
02:50:08,064 --> 02:50:10,524
SAM: Yes, Vater.

2164
02:50:10,524 --> 02:50:20,767
MATT: You guys are escorted to what-- It's really
off-putting for the two of you. Not only is the

2165
02:50:20,767 --> 02:50:25,901
smell clean inside here, but there's the scent of
lavender in the hallway, and you hear soft music

2166
02:50:25,901 --> 02:50:32,327
in the distance. As you walk past, you do see that
there is a resident violinist that plays, and you

2167
02:50:32,327 --> 02:50:33,732
guys are led to these two--

2168
02:50:33,732 --> 02:50:35,174
SAM: This is really nice!

2169
02:50:35,174 --> 02:50:36,650
LIAM: Yes, it is.

2170
02:50:36,650 --> 02:50:48,435
SAM: They got a violinist over there! I'm sorry,
zey got a violinist over zere, Vater.

2171
02:50:48,435 --> 02:51:02,212
LIAM: That's meine Liebchen. I'm hoping for a hot
bath for the both of us. It has been a long bit of travel.

2172
02:51:02,212 --> 02:51:07,850
MATT: "Right this way." Leads you into the
chambers. There is a glass, fogged window, so the

2173
02:51:07,850 --> 02:51:14,102
sunlight comes through, but no one can see
through. There are some linens set out, a towel,

2174
02:51:14,102 --> 02:51:20,546
and two basins that are freshly filled with
steaming water. You are left into the chamber.

2175
02:51:20,546 --> 02:51:22,216
LIAM: Are they separate, though?

2176
02:51:22,216 --> 02:51:27,635
MATT: They're separated by a small wall that's eye
length, but you can still talk to each other over it.

2177
02:51:27,635 --> 02:51:33,374
LIAM: Excellent. This is called a bath.

2178
02:51:33,374 --> 02:51:36,428
SAM: I've heard of them.

2179
02:51:36,428 --> 02:51:46,149
LIAM: A hot bath. We have been pretty dinged up
for the past several months, and we might not get

2180
02:51:46,149 --> 02:51:51,138
back into something like this for a while, so I
want you to enjoy it. Go over to your side, and I

2181
02:51:51,138 --> 02:51:56,716
will be here. Nott, I'm going to do a bit of
reading.

2182
02:51:56,716 --> 02:51:59,340
SAM: While you bathe?

2183
02:51:59,340 --> 02:52:00,654
LIAM: Yes.

2184
02:52:00,654 --> 02:52:05,329
SAM: You'll still be the same Caleb when you're
done, right?

2185
02:52:05,329 --> 02:52:07,271
LIAM: Yes, I will be the same Caleb.

2186
02:52:07,271 --> 02:52:09,989
SAM: I've just gotten used to you, and now you're going
to change a bit.

2187
02:52:09,989 --> 02:52:12,941
LIAM: Trust me, I will not.

2188
02:52:12,941 --> 02:52:15,138
SAM: All right.

2189
02:52:15,138 --> 02:52:22,344
LIAM: Once she is clear of the wall, I'm going to
start actually disrobing, although I guess the

2190
02:52:22,344 --> 02:52:23,971
illusion stays.

2191
02:52:23,971 --> 02:52:31,555
MATT: The illusion stays. Strangely, clothes start
apparating out of you. (slurping)

2192
02:52:31,555 --> 02:52:38,244
MARISHA: It's like a bad video game glitch. Bad
texture glitch.

2193
02:52:38,244 --> 02:52:44,559
LIAM: Nott, I'm probably going to go quiet for a
little while.

2194
02:52:44,559 --> 02:52:51,058
SAM: No problem. I'll just be over here, you know,
bathing.

2195
02:52:51,058 --> 02:53:01,906
LIAM: Enjoy it. I find the second book and examine
it. Am I able to read this?

2196
02:53:01,906 --> 02:53:12,240
MATT: You are, actually. There is one incomplete
arcane inscription in there. Unfortunately, it's

2197
02:53:12,240 --> 02:53:18,309
been too burned, beyond recognition. You can see
this was a spellbook. Mostly destroyed, but there

2198
02:53:18,309 --> 02:53:23,913
are two complete spells in there that, if you wish
to, you could transcribe over into your book.

2199
02:53:23,913 --> 02:53:28,448
Those would be Arcane Lock and Unseen Servant.

2200
02:53:28,448 --> 02:53:31,395
ALL: Ooh!

2201
02:53:31,395 --> 02:53:42,989
LIAM: So. All my actual clothes are off. I'm going to
take the book and set it on the edge of the basin.

2202
02:53:42,989 --> 02:53:52,016
MATT: Because you paid for it, there is a hinged,
small desk piece where food can be eaten, or

2203
02:53:52,016 --> 02:53:54,488
drinks could be served while people are taking a
bath.

2204
02:53:54,488 --> 02:54:06,478
LIAM: I set it down. I sit with just my legs in
the bath for a moment, and I look at the book.

2205
02:54:09,615 --> 02:54:10,645
[exhales]

2206
02:54:16,365 --> 02:54:23,522
SAM: I'm going to find the pitcher of cucumber
water, dump it on the floor, and eat all the cucumbers.

2207
02:54:23,522 --> 02:54:28,336
(laughter)

2208
02:54:28,336 --> 02:54:31,113
MATT: As you hear over the wall (gobbling).

2209
02:54:31,113 --> 02:54:34,360
SAM: Look around for anything in the room that can
be stolen?

2210
02:54:34,360 --> 02:54:44,811
MATT: Plenty of things, actually. No one's
watching. There's a vase that's really nice. The

2211
02:54:44,811 --> 02:54:52,008
doorknob itself is a brass, gold-like material.

2212
02:54:52,008 --> 02:54:53,581
SAM: I'll start working on that.

2213
02:54:53,581 --> 02:54:56,087
MATT: Using your thieves' tools, you can get that
free, if you want.

2214
02:54:56,087 --> 02:55:07,855
SAM: After a while, I put a toe into the water,
feel it, and I'm like: Nah. I'll use my empty

2215
02:55:07,855 --> 02:55:10,680
flask and fill it up with water.

2216
02:55:10,680 --> 02:55:12,971
MATT: Okay. You get a water flask.

2217
02:55:12,971 --> 02:55:14,874
SAM: Then work on the doorknob.

2218
02:55:14,874 --> 02:55:20,367
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a thieves' tools
check, adding your dexterity.

2219
02:55:20,367 --> 02:55:22,737
SAM: 12.

2220
02:55:22,737 --> 02:55:24,994
MATT: Add the dexterity and your proficiency.

2221
02:55:24,994 --> 02:55:26,685
SAM: Oh. 14.

2222
02:55:26,685 --> 02:55:35,634
MATT: There you go. With very little sound, the
doorknob comes off, and you have now a solid brass

2223
02:55:35,634 --> 02:55:37,938
doorknob. There is the vase.

2224
02:55:37,938 --> 02:55:41,032
SAM: Is it a big vase?

2225
02:55:41,032 --> 02:55:46,594
MATT: It's like that big. It's more of a
decorative flower holder over by the window.

2226
02:55:46,594 --> 02:55:48,625
SAM: Sure. I'll try to get that too.

2227
02:55:48,625 --> 02:55:52,166
MATT: Easy. You get it. There's nobody watching
you!

2228
02:55:52,166 --> 02:55:55,339
SAM: I'll also save the flowers in a separate
pouch.

2229
02:55:55,339 --> 02:55:57,241
MATT: Okay. There you go.

2230
02:55:57,241 --> 02:56:00,403
SAM: Any towels. Ooh, you know what?

2231
02:56:00,403 --> 02:56:02,029
MATT: Yeah, the linens can be taken.

2232
02:56:02,029 --> 02:56:07,467
SAM: I'm going to take one towel and tear it into
shreds, and use it to replace any of my bandages

2233
02:56:07,467 --> 02:56:09,337
that have worn or fallen off.

2234
02:56:09,337 --> 02:56:10,962
MATT: Easy enough. There's some nice clean
bandages. Good.

2235
02:56:10,962 --> 02:56:12,247
SAM: I'm good.

2236
02:56:12,247 --> 02:56:24,482
LIAM: On my side, while all of that is happening,
two things. One is that when I finally get into

2237
02:56:24,482 --> 02:56:34,104
the tub I dip my whole body almost entirely in,
but not my head or hair. Letting the bruises soak

2238
02:56:34,104 --> 02:56:40,318
in the hot water, which feels wonderful. The
second thing is, while flipping the pages of this

2239
02:56:40,318 --> 02:56:47,775
book, very still, I can hear all of this, and it
is extremely endearing, but I go completely still.

2240
02:56:47,775 --> 02:56:55,390
Completely quiet. And read in peace.

2241
02:56:55,390 --> 02:57:07,517
MATT: While you guys are taking a bath, the rest
of you are going off on a shopping trip. Except

2242
02:57:07,517 --> 02:57:08,572
for you, you're going to--

2243
02:57:08,572 --> 02:57:10,114
TALIESIN: No, I'm going map hunting.

2244
02:57:10,114 --> 02:57:11,902
MATT: That's right. You're going. Who's all going
together?

2245
02:57:11,902 --> 02:57:13,138
LAURA: All of us.

2246
02:57:13,138 --> 02:57:14,674
MATT: Where are you going?

2247
02:57:14,674 --> 02:57:23,314
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to ask Yorda if there's a
map maker in town.

2248
02:57:23,314 --> 02:57:26,398
TALIESIN: Or if she can draw us a map of how to
get there.

2249
02:57:26,398 --> 02:57:31,931
MATT: "There's not much of a specific cartographer
in place. Most of the cartography guilds are up

2250
02:57:31,931 --> 02:57:39,817
"north in either Zadash or Rexxentrum. There might
be one in Alfield? We're a bit small over here.

2251
02:57:39,817 --> 02:57:43,312
"You could ask the general store, or you could
maybe go to the stockade. They have maps there but

2252
02:57:43,312 --> 02:57:45,224
"they use those. You might be able to pay enough
for them."

2253
02:57:45,224 --> 02:57:47,252
LAURA: I don't want to go back to the stockade.

2254
02:57:47,252 --> 02:57:52,399
MATT: "Then maybe check the general store or any
of the strange book places might have something

2255
02:57:52,399 --> 02:57:54,002
"old and lying in the back."

2256
02:57:54,002 --> 02:57:56,329
LAURA: Ooh, what strange book places?

2257
02:57:56,329 --> 02:58:04,427
MATT: "Well, let's see. There's the Hillsbrook
Parchment and Binding. There's the Burnished

2258
02:58:04,427 --> 02:58:10,624
"Bibelots, that I think one of your friends has
already been to. Those are the two strange book

2259
02:58:10,624 --> 02:58:13,687
"places. I'm not much of a reader myself, so I
couldn't tell you."

2260
02:58:13,687 --> 02:58:16,299
LAURA: Can you draw me a map of how to get to
those places?

2261
02:58:16,299 --> 02:58:19,136
MARISHA: We've already been to the general store.

2262
02:58:19,136 --> 02:58:23,414
LAURA: Yes, you're right. I guess we can try that
place.

2263
02:58:23,414 --> 02:58:27,698
MARISHA: You can still make her draw a map. I
don't want to rain on your parade. I'm sorry.

2264
02:58:27,698 --> 02:58:29,323
TRAVIS: You just shit all over her.

2265
02:58:29,323 --> 02:58:30,899
MARISHA: I totally did.

2266
02:58:30,899 --> 02:58:35,918
MATT: She gives you directions.

2267
02:58:35,918 --> 02:58:41,617
LAURA: Let's go on a trip!

2268
02:58:41,617 --> 02:58:43,619
MATT: Where are you guys going first?

2269
02:58:43,619 --> 02:58:45,261
MARISHA: (singing) General store!

2270
02:58:45,261 --> 02:58:47,492
LAURA: We've been there before.

2271
02:58:47,492 --> 02:58:49,958
MARISHA: (singing) I want to buy another health
pack!

2272
02:58:49,958 --> 02:58:51,604
SAM: Health pack?

2273
02:58:51,604 --> 02:58:53,161
MARISHA: I meant a healer's kit.

2274
02:58:53,161 --> 02:58:59,868
LAURA: The general store doesn't like us very
much. Oh wait. That healer's kit, is that the one

2275
02:58:59,868 --> 02:59:01,721
you bought when we were together?

2276
02:59:01,721 --> 02:59:02,737
MARISHA: Yeah.

2277
02:59:02,737 --> 02:59:05,179
LAURA: You spent way too much money on it because
I changed the tag?

2278
02:59:05,179 --> 02:59:08,110
MARISHA: Yeah. That one.

2279
02:59:08,110 --> 02:59:11,666
LAURA: That was great. Now I have it. Cool.

2280
02:59:11,666 --> 02:59:13,408
MARISHA: You won twice.

2281
02:59:13,408 --> 02:59:15,448
MATT: Everything's coming up Jester.

2282
02:59:15,448 --> 02:59:17,952
LAURA: All right, let's go back there. They don't
like me, but let's go back there.

2283
02:59:17,952 --> 02:59:21,640
MARISHA: I can just pop in if you want to wait
outside.

2284
02:59:21,640 --> 02:59:23,140
LAURA: They don't like you either.

2285
02:59:23,140 --> 02:59:25,520
MARISHA, Yeah, but they like money. Let's go.

2286
02:59:25,520 --> 02:59:30,634
MATT: All right, so you guys make your way to
Lochward General in the Lochward District. As you

2287
02:59:30,634 --> 02:59:40,055
enter, the older woman, Harper Mince, is there in
the general store. It's the large, almost wooden

2288
02:59:40,055 --> 02:59:48,349
barn exterior. The front door opens two ways, and
the inside is wall-to-wall lined with tools for

2289
02:59:48,349 --> 02:59:55,358
farming and farming equipment for building.
There's lumber. There's all sorts of iron nails.

2290
02:59:55,358 --> 03:00:01,094
It's by all accounts a rural general store.

2291
03:00:01,094 --> 03:00:08,248
You see on far end is Harper, the older
woman there, standing and looking out at the rest

2292
03:00:08,339 --> 03:00:15,913
of you. "Hi, can I help you? What are you looking
for?"

2293
03:00:15,913 --> 03:00:20,083
LAURA: We are looking for pickles, did you get any
yet?

2294
03:00:20,083 --> 03:00:23,672
MATT: "No, we don't sell pickles here, sorry."

2295
03:00:23,672 --> 03:00:27,418
LAURA: Most general stores have pickles, this is
the only thing.

2296
03:00:27,418 --> 03:00:31,737
MARISHA: You're not wrong, generally, yeah.

2297
03:00:31,737 --> 03:00:34,154
MATT: "We can order some pickles, if you like."

2298
03:00:34,154 --> 03:00:39,638
LAURA: Yeah, you probably should. I think you
would do well if you sold pickles. Do you have

2299
03:00:39,638 --> 03:00:43,675
maps for sale of the area?

2300
03:00:44,112 --> 03:00:49,140
MATT: "The area? Let me check. I'll be right
back."

2301
03:00:49,140 --> 03:00:53,372
LAURA: Does she leave the room?

2302
03:00:53,372 --> 03:00:56,241
MATT: Yeah, she does. She leaves the room.

2303
03:00:56,241 --> 03:00:59,717
TRAVIS: Don't-- put your hands in your pockets.

2304
03:00:59,717 --> 03:01:04,323
LAURA: Don't put my hands in my pockets, got it! I
start running around and just moving everything on

2305
03:01:04,323 --> 03:01:07,036
the shelves again the same way as before.

2306
03:01:07,036 --> 03:01:08,592
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.

2307
03:01:08,592 --> 03:01:09,992
SAM: You're just moving things?

2308
03:01:09,992 --> 03:01:11,363
LAURA: Yeah, just like moving--

2309
03:01:11,363 --> 03:01:13,607
TRAVIS: Please be Laura when she was five and
break shit.

2310
03:01:13,607 --> 03:01:16,648
LAURA: Oh yes! 18 plus five.

2311
03:01:19,798 --> 03:01:20,995
TALIESIN: This is beautiful.

2312
03:01:22,101 --> 03:01:31,246
MATT: With nary a squeak you completely rearrange
in a period of about two and a half minutes most

2313
03:01:31,246 --> 03:01:39,187
of the price cards that are dangling from a number
of the tools, their placement. You guys all sit

2314
03:01:39,187 --> 03:01:45,005
back and watch as this glorious display-- you can
almost hear the William Tell Overture begin to

2315
03:01:45,005 --> 03:01:50,537
play in the back of your head as she rummages back
and forth throughout the interior of the chamber,

2316
03:01:50,537 --> 03:01:55,737
turning things around and sticking them in the
ground. It has been completely rearranged.

2317
03:01:55,737 --> 03:01:58,235
LIAM: [old man voice] Why 
is this crowbar seven gold?

2318
03:02:00,634 --> 03:02:06,744
MATT: Eventually you hear some rummaging from the
back room and some footsteps coming nearby and you

2319
03:02:06,744 --> 03:02:12,768
quickly stop and return to your original point
there and Harper Mince returns from the back room.

2320
03:02:12,768 --> 03:02:20,100
She has a few papers in her arms. She goes, "I'm
sorry, we don't have any maps of the local area

2321
03:02:20,100 --> 03:02:27,232
for detail. I have a map of the Dwendalian Empire
as a whole, I hope that's enough."

2322
03:02:27,232 --> 03:02:35,789
LAURA: I mean, that could work, I suppose. It's
not what we <i>need</i>, but if that's what you have

2323
03:02:35,789 --> 03:02:39,277
that's what we can buy from you.

2324
03:02:39,277 --> 03:02:46,052
MATT: "All right, let me look at the date here.
This will run about seven silver."

2325
03:02:46,052 --> 03:02:49,912
LAURA: Okay, that sounds like a good price, yeah.

2326
03:02:49,912 --> 03:02:55,970
MARISHA: Can I also get another healer's kit? If
you have one.

2327
03:02:55,970 --> 03:03:02,015
MATT: "Right, yes, let me go ahead and get that
for you here." The healer's kit. Looking up the

2328
03:03:02,015 --> 03:03:08,881
pricing in the equipment section.That is five gold
pieces for the healer's kit.

2329
03:03:08,881 --> 03:03:11,653
(groaning)

2330
03:03:11,653 --> 03:03:13,292
MARISHA: Five gold.

2331
03:03:13,292 --> 03:03:15,906
MATT: All right, mark it off. You get yourself a
secondary healer's kit.

2332
03:03:15,906 --> 03:03:18,484
MARISHA: Well, one healer's kit. She's got the
other one.

2333
03:03:18,484 --> 03:03:20,238
MATT: You hand over the seven silver?

2334
03:03:20,238 --> 03:03:22,101
LAURA: Yes, I do.

2335
03:03:22,101 --> 03:03:25,244
MATT: She takes it and put the ribbon back on it.

2336
03:03:28,291 --> 03:03:32,028
<i>Finally</i> get to give that to you guys.

2337
03:03:32,028 --> 03:03:34,476
LIAM: Shut the front door!

2338
03:03:34,476 --> 03:03:38,479
LAURA: <i>And</i> I have a pretty ribbon out of it.

2339
03:03:38,479 --> 03:03:40,463
TALIESIN: We're going to Goonies this really
quickly here. Ready?

2340
03:03:42,253 --> 03:03:45,386
LAURA: What the fuck?!

2341
03:03:45,386 --> 03:03:49,393
SAM: That's beautiful! Who made this? Did you make
this?

2342
03:03:49,393 --> 03:03:56,600
MATT: I designed the layout, but the map is made
by a wonderful woman named Deven Rue, who does

2343
03:03:56,600 --> 03:03:59,553
incredible handcrafted maps.

2344
03:03:59,553 --> 03:04:01,104
SAM: You got to get a camera on this shit.

2345
03:04:01,104 --> 03:04:02,829
TRAVIS: Hold it up!

2346
03:04:02,829 --> 03:04:04,479
MARISHA: Put it in the middle.

2347
03:04:04,479 --> 03:04:06,701
TALIESIN: Take a look, it's amazing!

2348
03:04:06,701 --> 03:04:09,366
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

2349
03:04:09,366 --> 03:04:12,484
MARISHA: Wait, where are we?

2350
03:04:12,484 --> 03:04:17,773
MATT: You guys are in Trostenwald, right there.
This is north, this is south.

2351
03:04:17,773 --> 03:04:19,687
SAM: Angle it to that camera.

2352
03:04:19,687 --> 03:04:21,424
LAURA: What camera?

2353
03:04:21,424 --> 03:04:23,161
ALL: Wow.

2354
03:04:23,161 --> 03:04:29,219
MATT: This is the Dwendalian Empire. This is not
all of Wildemount, this is just a portion. Deven

2355
03:04:29,500 --> 03:04:38,068
did an incredible job with this. You should follow
her on Patreon or Twitter, she does amazing work.

2356
03:04:38,068 --> 03:04:39,448
She does incredible work.

2357
03:04:39,448 --> 03:04:42,611
LAURA: Oh my god, you guys, let's go all of these
places.

2358
03:04:42,611 --> 03:04:45,573
ASHLEY: Maybe not <i>all</i> of them.

2359
03:04:45,573 --> 03:04:51,420
LAURA: Okay, we are definitely going to visit this
place called Hupperdook.

2360
03:04:51,420 --> 03:04:54,481
SAM: I think I had one of those this morning.

2361
03:04:54,674 --> 03:04:57,572
[laughter]

2362
03:04:57,572 --> 03:05:04,775
LAURA: Then we'll make our way up to Nogvuror. Oh
man, this is awesome. Hey look, look over here!

2363
03:05:04,775 --> 03:05:06,471
This is where I live!

2364
03:05:06,471 --> 03:05:07,894
SAM: There be dragons there.

2365
03:05:07,894 --> 03:05:09,305
TALIESIN: You live in a serpent?

2366
03:05:09,305 --> 03:05:10,426
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

2367
03:05:10,426 --> 03:05:12,993
MATT: By the way, Deven, who did the map, it is
her birthday today.

2368
03:05:13,213 --> 03:05:16,454
MARISHA: Happy birthday, Deven!

2369
03:05:16,454 --> 03:05:22,052
LAURA: Damn, this is amazing! Okay, I'll leave it
up here.

2370
03:05:22,052 --> 03:05:28,504
TALIESIN: If you pull out a real medi-kit now I'm
going to be really excited. 50 bandages come

2371
03:05:28,504 --> 03:05:29,716
flying in...

2372
03:05:29,716 --> 03:05:30,799
ASHLEY: That is so beautiful.

2373
03:05:30,799 --> 03:05:38,620
MATT: She did an incredible job. The exchange is
done, you have your map. Anything else you guys

2374
03:05:38,620 --> 03:05:39,945
want to handle?

2375
03:05:39,945 --> 03:05:40,682
TALIESIN: Medi-kit?

2376
03:05:40,682 --> 03:05:42,161
MARISHA: I got it.

2377
03:05:42,161 --> 03:05:49,157
LAURA: Can I just look around and see if there's
anything interesting to buy in here, like--

2378
03:05:52,477 --> 03:05:58,639
MATT: There's plenty of tools. There are various
packs of supplies.

2379
03:05:59,120 --> 03:06:07,321
LAURA: I guess if I bought the painter's kit then
it just stays and I don't run out of that.

2380
03:06:07,321 --> 03:06:09,247
MATT: Over time you would run out of it.

2381
03:06:09,247 --> 03:06:10,298
LAURA: But I'm good on paint?

2382
03:06:10,298 --> 03:06:12,105
MATT: Good for a while.

2383
03:06:12,105 --> 03:06:16,443
TRAVIS: Can I actually approach the storekeep and
say: do you know of any stores that have arcane

2384
03:06:16,443 --> 03:06:21,337
items, things with magical properties, healing
potions?

2385
03:06:21,337 --> 03:06:28,507
MATT: "I'm sorry, we're a bit out of the center of
the country for arcane items. You'd want to go

2386
03:06:28,507 --> 03:06:29,936
further north for that."

2387
03:06:29,936 --> 03:06:32,422
TRAVIS: Further north? I appreciate your time,
thank you.

2388
03:06:32,422 --> 03:06:33,720
MATT: "Of course."

2389
03:06:33,720 --> 03:06:35,272
MARISHA: This town blows.

2390
03:06:35,272 --> 03:06:38,511
TRAVIS: She's right fucking there.

2391
03:06:38,511 --> 03:06:40,021
MARISHA: I don't care.

2392
03:06:41,828 --> 03:06:44,520
[laughter]

2393
03:06:48,301 --> 03:06:49,909
TRAVIS: Shall we depart?

2394
03:06:50,989 --> 03:06:56,674
LAURA: Sure. Thank you so much for this beautiful
map. You did a really good job drawing it.

2395
03:07:01,444 --> 03:07:02,761
MATT: Take your map.

2396
03:07:05,051 --> 03:07:08,111
ASHLEY: I also really like what you've done with
the place.

2397
03:07:09,166 --> 03:07:11,790
MATT: "Thank you very much--"

2398
03:07:13,574 --> 03:07:15,887
MARISHA: Let's go, bye! Thank you!

2399
03:07:15,887 --> 03:07:16,987
MATT: "I-- um..."

2400
03:07:16,987 --> 03:07:17,987
TRAVIS: Gotta go!

2401
03:07:17,987 --> 03:07:19,342
MARISHA: [bell dangling noises]

2402
03:07:19,342 --> 03:07:23,120
MATT: As you guys all exit, she begins to come
around the counter.

2403
03:07:23,120 --> 03:07:27,151
TALIESIN: I like the idea of you just
standing there going, [bell dangling noises]

2404
03:07:31,185 --> 03:07:35,810
LAURA: Wherever we go, I'm going to bury my head
in the map and walk behind everybody like a total

2405
03:07:35,810 --> 03:07:37,454
tourist.

2406
03:07:38,815 --> 03:07:45,509
TALIESIN: Well, that's the question: are we going
to be able to grab a cart or two from the circus?

2407
03:07:45,509 --> 03:07:47,433
MATT: You can probably get a cart.

2408
03:07:47,433 --> 03:07:53,925
TALIESIN: Like one of the little vardos? Can we
snag a vardo?

2409
03:07:53,925 --> 03:08:02,462
MATT: Technically it's <i>a</i> vardo and the three of
them took it. There's a vardo and then there's

2410
03:08:02,462 --> 03:08:08,376
some carts. You weren't rolling with a pretty
heavy-- honestly, most of the room in the carts

2411
03:08:08,376 --> 03:08:15,543
was either for carrying you guys, whatever small
bags you had with you, and the poles you would

2412
03:08:15,543 --> 03:08:22,893
assemble to make the tent. Are you guys done with
your business? Anything else you want to do while

2413
03:08:22,893 --> 03:08:24,169
you're out and about?

2414
03:08:24,169 --> 03:08:25,224
TRAVIS: That's it for me.

2415
03:08:25,224 --> 03:08:28,651
LAURA: There's nowhere we can buy healing potions
in this city?

2416
03:08:28,651 --> 03:08:35,601
MATT: There's Natural Remedies, which you've
passed before, but not entered. It's an herbal

2417
03:08:35,601 --> 03:08:37,350
healers establishment.

2418
03:08:37,350 --> 03:08:38,650
LAURA: Let's try that.

2419
03:08:38,650 --> 03:08:40,388
TALIESIN: I'm very wary of this, but fine.

2420
03:08:40,388 --> 03:08:42,662
TRAVIS: It's going to smell like "Sephoria," I
know it.

2421
03:08:42,662 --> 03:08:44,909
LAURA: Sephora.

2422
03:08:44,909 --> 03:08:49,383
TRAVIS: That's the fancy version.

2423
03:08:49,383 --> 03:08:54,300
MATT: Now, you guys had left earlier, so as you
guys head toward Natural Remedies, you guys finish

2424
03:08:54,300 --> 03:08:56,266
your bath.

2425
03:08:56,266 --> 03:09:06,709
LIAM: I pack up. I said we're staying for an
hour, so I cast Disguise Self again to

2426
03:09:06,709 --> 03:09:10,794
keep the illusion going. I'm done, you look--

2427
03:09:10,794 --> 03:09:14,149
SAM: I splashed some water on my face.

2428
03:09:14,149 --> 03:09:15,130
LIAM: --refreshed.

2429
03:09:15,130 --> 03:09:20,323
SAM: Oh, it was such a good bath. I'm ready to go
now, I feel refreshed.

2430
03:09:20,323 --> 03:09:21,530
LIAM: Did you like it, though?

2431
03:09:21,530 --> 03:09:24,145
SAM: It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

2432
03:09:24,145 --> 03:09:28,678
LIAM: I wanted to repay you for all you've done
for me for the past couple of days.

2433
03:09:28,678 --> 03:09:40,334
SAM: Consider it paid! You look the same. Does he
look the same?

2434
03:09:40,334 --> 03:09:41,369
MATT: Yeah.

2435
03:09:41,369 --> 03:09:47,898
LIAM: The brief moment that I was in my own guise
nothing changed up here, so I look exactly the way

2436
03:09:47,898 --> 03:09:49,643
I did this morning.

2437
03:09:49,643 --> 03:09:51,510
LAURA: What's the purpose of that?

2438
03:09:51,510 --> 03:09:57,459
LIAM: Who said that? You wanted to do something,
right?

2439
03:09:57,459 --> 03:10:01,213
SAM: I wanted to go to Herbal Remedies and see if
we could get you a healing potion.

2440
03:10:01,213 --> 03:10:07,805
LIAM: Let's do that, then. You lead the way. Well
wait, you lead the way outside. Let's keep our

2441
03:10:07,805 --> 03:10:11,313
little schtick going here and then off we go.

2442
03:10:11,313 --> 03:10:13,105
MATT: All right. As you guys exit--

2443
03:10:13,105 --> 03:10:14,286
SAM: Auf Wiedersehen!

2444
03:10:14,286 --> 03:10:19,594
MATT: "I trust you enjoyed your time at the bath,
thank you."

2445
03:10:19,594 --> 03:10:24,482
LIAM: Yes, but we have to go. Sorry, I'm late for
a very important appointment. I drag Nott right

2446
03:10:24,482 --> 03:10:26,916
out of here because I saw no doorknob on the
door.

2447
03:10:26,916 --> 03:10:34,352
MATT: Yeah, amongst other things. You guys make
your way out and beeline it towards the Lochward

2448
03:10:34,352 --> 03:10:40,555
to where you would find Natural Remedies. The rest
of you guys, as you approach the exterior, amongst the

2449
03:10:40,607 --> 03:10:48,039
rest of the buildings in the central city, Natural
Remedies is, for lack of a better term, humble.

2450
03:10:48,039 --> 03:10:54,265
It's a small shack, but as soon as you approach it
has very strong, pungent smells of funguses.

2451
03:10:54,265 --> 03:10:58,708
TRAVIS: Instant headache.

2452
03:10:58,708 --> 03:11:05,822
MATT: Yep. On the outside you can see, right where
the doorway is open, there are strings of herbs

2453
03:11:05,822 --> 03:11:10,392
that are tied up and left to dry out. On the
inside, you can already see that there are shelves

2454
03:11:10,392 --> 03:11:17,434
of various flora and fauna that are being
cultivated for various remedies and means of

2455
03:11:17,434 --> 03:11:25,692
selling to anybody who wants to come by and
procure herbal medicines. Let's see who's

2456
03:11:25,692 --> 03:11:32,022
handling this one, because you guys have not been
here yet. As you enter the main chamber--

2457
03:11:32,022 --> 03:11:37,950
LIAM: Sorry, I will say that on the way there
that I dropped the disguise, somewhere.

2458
03:11:37,950 --> 03:11:43,136
MATT: Okay, easily enough, so you guys haven't
arrived yet. You guys have arrived. As you enter the interior,

2459
03:11:43,136 --> 03:11:50,547
it's a very musty smell on the inside, too.
There's a lot of fungus being grown on the inside

2460
03:11:50,547 --> 03:11:55,248
here, and you can see that elements of it may have
expanded into the corners of the actual room and

2461
03:11:55,248 --> 03:12:05,541
it's not necessarily the nicest space to be
wandering in. It seems natural. Across the way,

2462
03:12:05,541 --> 03:12:16,628
you see a gentleman of relatively tanned skin,
with darker hair that's ratty and clustered. He's

2463
03:12:16,628 --> 03:12:25,368
in his late twenties or so, looks to be upon
closer inspection partial elven blood, partial

2464
03:12:25,368 --> 03:12:33,489
human blood, and he's in the process of carefully
carving a large stalk of what looks like a fungus

2465
03:12:33,489 --> 03:12:38,842
off of a small pot that he pulled off one of the
shelves. As you enter, he doesn't even make eye

2466
03:12:38,842 --> 03:12:49,603
contact. He goes, "Hello, please, just wait a
moment. There we are. Hi, can I help you?"

2467
03:12:49,603 --> 03:12:54,908
LAURA: Yeah, my friends keep dying. Do you have any
health potions?

2468
03:12:54,908 --> 03:13:03,641
MATT: "We have a handful, that is correct. How
many are you looking to purchase?"

2469
03:13:03,641 --> 03:13:06,060
LAURA: How many do you have?

2470
03:13:06,060 --> 03:13:09,693
MATT: "Four."

2471
03:13:09,693 --> 03:13:14,049
LAURA: Ooh. That will last us probably, like, a
day.

2472
03:13:14,049 --> 03:13:17,247
MATT: "What do you do for a living?"

2473
03:13:17,247 --> 03:13:19,068
LAURA: We're superheroes.

2474
03:13:19,068 --> 03:13:20,650
TALIESIN: Sword jugglers.

2475
03:13:20,650 --> 03:13:24,285
MATT: "Why would-- Fine, who am I to ask?"

2476
03:13:24,285 --> 03:13:25,948
MARISHA: Look at this bruise.

2477
03:13:25,948 --> 03:13:27,363
MATT: "I cut fungus for a living."

2478
03:13:27,363 --> 03:13:29,631
MARISHA: Look, it's in the shape of a dick.

2479
03:13:29,631 --> 03:13:35,391
MATT: "I'm not going to ask. Four? Did you want
them?"

2480
03:13:35,391 --> 03:13:38,955
LAURA: Sure, yes. How much for four healing
potions?

2481
03:13:38,955 --> 03:13:45,427
MATT: "For four healing potions," and he pulls
them out and plops them on the table, "240 gold pieces."

2482
03:13:45,427 --> 03:13:48,182
TALIESIN: Level two.

2483
03:13:48,182 --> 03:13:54,716
LAURA: Okay, hold on. I open up my pack and I pour
out all my money. I start counting it.

2484
03:13:54,716 --> 03:14:05,478
ASHLEY: Do you have a deal, you know, if we got
all of them? That seems pretty high. Right? That

2485
03:14:05,478 --> 03:14:07,917
seems pretty high for a healing potion.

2486
03:14:07,917 --> 03:14:17,418
MATT: Make a persuasion check with disadvantage.
Yasha: the wheeler and dealer.

2487
03:14:17,418 --> 03:14:22,679
ASHLEY: Three.

2488
03:14:22,679 --> 03:14:34,284
MATT: "No, actually, I think it's rather standard
in these parts. But I can put them back."

2489
03:14:34,284 --> 03:14:38,555
TALIESIN: Healing potions aside, you are doing
something really interesting and exciting here.

2490
03:14:38,555 --> 03:14:45,232
You're not a healing potion dealer. What are you
doing here? Like this is fascinating.

2491
03:14:45,232 --> 03:14:58,147
MATT: "Oh, I create all sorts of means of tending
to wounds and loss of stamina. To be honest, a lot

2492
03:14:58,147 --> 03:15:01,858
"of people come around here for
performance-enhancing fungus."

2493
03:15:01,858 --> 03:15:08,293
TALIESIN: I don't know, I feel like you can excite
me. I feel like there's something that you have to

2494
03:15:08,293 --> 03:15:11,911
show that's really exciting. I'm not entirely sure
it's all about stamina, I think you've got

2495
03:15:11,911 --> 03:15:19,497
something-- you did that on purpose. Talk to me
like I'm a child, show me something I've never

2496
03:15:19,497 --> 03:15:21,174
seen before.

2497
03:15:21,174 --> 03:15:24,753
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

2498
03:15:24,753 --> 03:15:30,077
TALIESIN: Not with advantage, because I don't have
it, but I was so excited.

2499
03:15:30,077 --> 03:15:31,310
MATT: Nope.

2500
03:15:31,310 --> 03:15:45,766
TALIESIN: Persuasion check. 19. I'm fishing for
drugs, I'm not going to lie. I've been on the road

2501
03:15:45,766 --> 03:15:47,586
a long time, I don't remember how to do this.

2502
03:15:47,586 --> 03:16:00,306
MATT: He leans in close to you. "Mind closing the
door?"

2503
03:16:00,349 --> 03:16:06,112
TALIESIN: I skip over to the door and gingerly
close it.

2504
03:16:06,112 --> 03:16:13,918
MATT: "Keep curious company, that's true."

2505
03:16:13,918 --> 03:16:18,170
TALIESIN: Yes, I do. And we're leaving town
today.

2506
03:16:18,170 --> 03:16:25,195
MATT: "Those are magical words for a man of my
business. Are you a fan of skein?"

2507
03:16:25,195 --> 03:16:27,416
TALIESIN: I don't actually know what that is.

2508
03:16:27,416 --> 03:16:37,564
MATT: "Well," and he goes back into the back
chamber, comes back with a small satchel. There's

2509
03:16:37,564 --> 03:16:46,844
a finely dried, dusted material on the inside, it
has a grayish-blue color to it. He goes, "This is

2510
03:16:46,844 --> 03:16:53,570
"a dried and ground fungus called skein. It's
called skein because when you eat it you can see

2511
03:16:53,570 --> 03:16:55,764
"the weave of time."

2512
03:16:55,764 --> 03:16:58,899
MARISHA: Is that what skein means?

2513
03:16:58,899 --> 03:17:02,300
MATT: "It's a woven skein, it's a joke on fate--
never mind."

2514
03:17:02,300 --> 03:17:04,844
TALIESIN: I thought it was very clever.

2515
03:17:04,844 --> 03:17:10,788
MATT: "Thank you very much. It's effective, it's
popular on the outskirts where it's not so heavily

2516
03:17:10,788 --> 03:17:15,913
"controlled and carries a huge jail-time if caught.
How much are you looking to purchase?"

2517
03:17:15,913 --> 03:17:22,513
TALIESIN: I've got to be honest, I'm not made of
money, but I'm always curious for a new experience.

2518
03:17:22,513 --> 03:17:25,503
MARISHA: Can I do an insight check on this guy?

2519
03:17:25,503 --> 03:17:26,715
MATT: Sure, go for it.

2520
03:17:26,715 --> 03:17:28,043
MARISHA: See if he's trying to scam us.

2521
03:17:28,043 --> 03:17:29,342
MATT: Go for it.

2522
03:17:29,342 --> 03:17:32,463
MARISHA: Can I use my criminal background?

2523
03:17:32,463 --> 03:17:33,889
MATT: Sure.

2524
03:17:33,889 --> 03:17:42,422
LIAM: All right, Marisha said that, not
Beauregard.

2525
03:17:42,422 --> 03:17:47,015
MARISHA: To know if he's actually giving what he's
giving?

2526
03:17:47,015 --> 03:17:51,826
MATT: You know what? Make your insight check.

2527
03:17:51,826 --> 03:17:54,158
MARISHA: Just straight insight.

2528
03:17:54,158 --> 03:17:55,686
MATT: Straight insight.

2529
03:17:55,686 --> 03:18:02,080
MARISHA: It's not as good as I would've hoped.
18.

2530
03:18:02,080 --> 03:18:04,275
MATT: Not as good as I hoped: 18.

2531
03:18:04,275 --> 03:18:08,570
LIAM: That's a slam dunk at level two.

2532
03:18:08,570 --> 03:18:14,599
MATT: Seems on the level, seems excited that
somebody's asking about it. You get the sense

2533
03:18:14,599 --> 03:18:18,612
that maybe he makes a lot of this either for
himself or in hopes that somebody asks about it

2534
03:18:18,612 --> 03:18:25,322
and is seemingly excited that somebody in this
bumfuck town, in his opinion, would even have

2535
03:18:25,322 --> 03:18:30,374
interest. You have once encountered this substance
before, and it does seem legit.

2536
03:18:30,374 --> 03:18:32,450
MARISHA: Okay.

2537
03:18:32,450 --> 03:18:38,544
ASHLEY: How do we know if it's good quality,
though? Can I give it a sample?

2538
03:18:38,544 --> 03:18:42,357
TALIESIN: Well, this might be complicated, I think
that just-- What would--

2539
03:18:42,357 --> 03:18:44,497
TRAVIS: How about a few experiences?

2540
03:18:44,497 --> 03:18:46,247
TALIESIN: A few experiences' worth. What would that
run me?

2541
03:18:46,247 --> 03:18:52,797
MATT: Hey guys, we're dealing D&amp;D drugs.

2542
03:18:52,797 --> 03:18:55,975
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for dragging
the entire audience into this. Hopefully your

2543
03:18:55,975 --> 03:18:58,986
children are already asleep, I do apologize.

2544
03:18:58,986 --> 03:19:02,585
SAM: D&amp;D Beyond, everybody. Our sponsor for the
evening.

2545
03:19:02,585 --> 03:19:10,128
TALIESIN: Thank you for really bringing that to
earth for me. You started this.

2546
03:19:10,128 --> 03:19:13,615
MATT: "I'll put you in at a gold an experience,
how about that?"

2547
03:19:13,615 --> 03:19:19,381
TALIESIN: All right. Yeah, put me in for one. I'll
try anything once.

2548
03:19:19,381 --> 03:19:30,479
MATT: He takes a small little batch of this dried,
powdered fungus, and puts it into a small glass

2549
03:19:30,479 --> 03:19:32,273
vial, corks it, and hands it over.

2550
03:19:32,273 --> 03:19:36,457
ASHLEY: Well, you might as well make another one.
I'm not going to let my friend experience it alone.

2551
03:19:36,457 --> 03:19:37,889
TALIESIN: What's it called? Skein?

2552
03:19:37,889 --> 03:19:41,323
MATT: Skein. S-K-E-I-N. I believe that's how it's
spelled.

2553
03:19:41,323 --> 03:19:44,887
LAURA: Yasha, you should take it with them. Right
now. It'll be fun.

2554
03:19:44,887 --> 03:19:51,373
TALIESIN: No, this is not how this works. This is
not how this works. We bank our moments for those

2555
03:19:51,373 --> 03:19:53,363
moments when life is disappointing.

2556
03:19:53,363 --> 03:19:55,702
TRAVIS: I know a unique substance when I see it,
I'll take one as well.

2557
03:19:55,702 --> 03:19:56,842
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

2558
03:19:56,842 --> 03:19:58,189
MARISHA: One for me too.

2559
03:19:58,189 --> 03:19:59,720
TALIESIN: This can come in handy in all sorts of
ways.

2560
03:19:59,720 --> 03:20:06,309
MATT: God damn it, guys.

2561
03:20:06,309 --> 03:20:12,491
TALIESIN: The fact that you had this ready means
that there is no shame here. You were ready for this.

2562
03:20:12,491 --> 03:20:16,167
MATT: You're right, I am not making any of this up
on the spot at all.

2563
03:20:16,167 --> 03:20:17,419
TALIESIN: I know, I can tell!

2564
03:20:17,419 --> 03:20:24,035
LIAM: This guy went from the Simpson's Safeway
clerk to the shadiest motherfucker in a snap of

2565
03:20:24,035 --> 03:20:26,262
time, because of your question.

2566
03:20:26,262 --> 03:20:30,182
TALIESIN: A big, purple, pierced demon walked into
the room and was like, hello.

2567
03:20:30,182 --> 03:20:34,275
LIAM: Yes, can I help you, good sir? Yes, I can
help you.

2568
03:20:34,275 --> 03:20:39,040
TRAVIS: I'll tell you what, because you are such a
purveyor of such interesting items, I will take

2569
03:20:39,040 --> 03:20:45,881
one of those health potions, but for 50 gold.
That's the running price I've seen in neighboring

2570
03:20:45,881 --> 03:20:48,437
towns, and I don't mean to be swindled.

2571
03:20:48,437 --> 03:20:57,143
MARISHA: I assume you'd want to go ahead and give
it to us for that so that we keep this a secret.

2572
03:20:57,143 --> 03:21:01,208
MATT: Make a persuasion check, with advantage.

2573
03:21:01,208 --> 03:21:09,269
TRAVIS: 21.

2574
03:21:09,269 --> 03:21:19,687
MATT: "50 gold," and he pulls his hair back a bit,
"Seems fair." Takes a potion and hands it over. He

2575
03:21:19,687 --> 03:21:24,412
scoops a little vial and says, "And for fun." He
throws it over.

2576
03:21:24,412 --> 03:21:29,267
LIAM: You fucking badass.

2577
03:21:29,267 --> 03:21:33,524
SAM: Cut to an hour later, and someone's jamming
an adrenaline needle.

2578
03:21:33,524 --> 03:21:41,233
MATT: TPK by misuse?

2579
03:21:41,233 --> 03:21:47,037
TALIESIN: Somewhere around level eight, this is
going to be hilarious. Somewhere around level

2580
03:21:47,037 --> 03:21:50,392
eight somebody's going to go shopping and the rest
of us are going to be like: this is now, this is

2581
03:21:50,392 --> 03:21:52,066
happening now.

2582
03:21:52,066 --> 03:21:55,409
MATT: This has become the longest afterschool
special I think we've ever experienced.

2583
03:21:55,409 --> 03:21:57,294
TALIESIN: Years in the making.

2584
03:21:57,294 --> 03:22:05,302
MATT: He immediately gets nervous at her mention
of--

2585
03:22:05,302 --> 03:22:09,220
TALIESIN: She's fine, she's just awful, you're a
gentleman, I hope to see you again. I'm looking

2586
03:22:09,220 --> 03:22:10,821
forward to this.

2587
03:22:10,821 --> 03:22:11,909
MATT: "I'll be here."

2588
03:22:11,909 --> 03:22:14,688
TALIESIN: Of course, we never met you, you never
met us.

2589
03:22:14,688 --> 03:22:16,578
MATT: "Of course not. I don't know who you are."

2590
03:22:16,578 --> 03:22:21,897
TALIESIN: I am already out the door, with a
flourish.

2591
03:22:21,897 --> 03:22:26,161
MATT: At which point, you run outside just as
Caleb and Nott are approaching.

2592
03:22:26,161 --> 03:22:33,261
MARISHA: Before I go out I say, nice to meet you,
mister--?

2593
03:22:33,261 --> 03:22:42,632
MATT: "Davies."

2594
03:22:42,632 --> 03:22:50,970
TRAVIS: The decision was still happening by the
time you got to the last letter.

2595
03:22:50,970 --> 03:22:58,933
MARISHA: I go: Okay, Davies.

2596
03:22:58,933 --> 03:23:10,745
LAURA: I guess I'll scoop my money back into
my pouch and leave.

2597
03:23:10,745 --> 03:23:13,897
MARISHA: Do you want anything?

2598
03:23:13,897 --> 03:23:15,794
LAURA: No.

2599
03:23:15,794 --> 03:23:18,915
MATT: You bump into Caleb and Nott on the way
out.

2600
03:23:18,915 --> 03:23:22,445
LIAM: What's the matter, do you have a cold?

2601
03:23:22,445 --> 03:23:26,504
LAURA: You don't smell bad, what did you do?

2602
03:23:26,504 --> 03:23:32,644
MATT: Actually, ironically, his clothes do still
smell pretty bad, and he still looks awful.

2603
03:23:32,644 --> 03:23:35,678
LAURA: You don't smell as bad.

2604
03:23:35,678 --> 03:23:39,173
MATT: That's true, on a gradient scale, he does
smell a little better.

2605
03:23:39,173 --> 03:23:42,344
LIAM: I will take that as a compliment, thank you.
What are you guys doing here, are you shopping?

2606
03:23:42,344 --> 03:23:43,702
What do they have in there?

2607
03:23:43,702 --> 03:23:45,466
LAURA: They bought drugs.

2608
03:23:45,466 --> 03:23:47,554
TRAVIS: That is an over-exaggeration.

2609
03:23:47,554 --> 03:23:50,223
TALIESIN: That is an extreme over-exaggeration. We
got a health potion.

2610
03:23:50,223 --> 03:23:51,598
SAM: All of you?

2611
03:23:51,598 --> 03:23:54,656
MARISHA: Well, it was kind of a ploy to get a
cheaper health potion.

2612
03:23:54,656 --> 03:23:55,602
TALIESIN: It worked.

2613
03:23:55,602 --> 03:23:59,789
MARISHA: And we got drugs on top of it. It was a
win-win, am I right?

2614
03:23:59,789 --> 03:24:04,188
LAURA: If you guys go in there and you buy a
health potion, don't spend as much as he says,

2615
03:24:04,188 --> 03:24:06,166
because apparently he was lying.

2616
03:24:06,166 --> 03:24:08,136
LIAM: How much do they run for?

2617
03:24:08,136 --> 03:24:13,562
TRAVIS: Health potions were quoted at 70, but he
was kind enough to understand that 50 was enough.

2618
03:24:13,562 --> 03:24:15,012
LIAM: 70?

2619
03:24:15,012 --> 03:24:16,710
TRAVIS: Gold pieces.

2620
03:24:16,710 --> 03:24:18,745
SAM: North we go.

2621
03:24:18,745 --> 03:24:21,326
TALIESIN: North, to the horses.

2622
03:24:21,326 --> 03:24:23,672
LIAM: We have a plan for the day?

2623
03:24:23,672 --> 03:24:34,201
LAURA: Yes, and I show them the map that we just
got. We're heading that way. Can I take the ribbon

2624
03:24:34,201 --> 03:24:37,173
that was wrapped around the map and tie it around
one of my horns?

2625
03:24:37,173 --> 03:24:38,455
MATT: Easily enough.

2626
03:24:38,455 --> 03:24:40,300
MARISHA: That's cute.

2627
03:24:40,300 --> 03:24:41,341
LAURA: Thank you.

2628
03:24:41,341 --> 03:24:43,706
SAM: We could rob the store.

2629
03:24:43,706 --> 03:24:48,482
LIAM: Do you have a strategy for that?

2630
03:24:48,482 --> 03:24:55,401
SAM: I mean, we could use one of our pre-planned
strategies.

2631
03:24:55,401 --> 03:25:00,141
LIAM: Which one would that be? Because I was
thinking about it on the walk here and I can't

2632
03:25:00,141 --> 03:25:01,890
think which one applies.

2633
03:25:01,890 --> 03:25:11,792
TALIESIN: I was going to say, robbing shady people
is usually a bad idea.

2634
03:25:11,792 --> 03:25:14,949
MARISHA: Do we hear them doing these plans? Do we
hear you guys making this plan?

2635
03:25:14,949 --> 03:25:17,497
LIAM: No, I wouldn't be saying this out loud if
you're close.

2636
03:25:17,497 --> 03:25:24,131
SAM: We could just do the simplest: the Prince and
the Pauper.

2637
03:25:24,131 --> 03:25:35,450
LIAM: Here's the thing, I have died almost twice
in two days. We have our friends and I think

2638
03:25:35,450 --> 03:25:37,690
that's a good way to start.

2639
03:25:37,690 --> 03:25:38,899
SAM: All right.

2640
03:25:38,899 --> 03:25:42,776
LIAM: I mean, you know, we almost all got pinched
yesterday.

2641
03:25:42,776 --> 03:25:54,183
SAM: You're right, we should leave town with our
wits about us and full of health. Let's just go

2642
03:25:54,183 --> 03:25:58,439
while we're ahead. Besides, I got plenty of stuff
today.

2643
03:25:58,439 --> 03:26:02,104
LIAM: You and me?

2644
03:26:02,104 --> 03:26:03,697
SAM: Yeah, let's go.

2645
03:26:03,697 --> 03:26:07,787
LIAM: All right. Okay, where are we going first?

2646
03:26:07,787 --> 03:26:13,508
LAURA: We're heading north to--

2647
03:26:13,508 --> 03:26:15,449
LIAM: Is it this big?

2648
03:26:15,449 --> 03:26:17,169
MATT: That's the size of the map.

2649
03:26:17,169 --> 03:26:27,091
LAURA: I mean, we can stop through Alfield first
and see if there's anything cool there, or-- what

2650
03:26:27,091 --> 03:26:30,524
city was it that the academy was in?

2651
03:26:30,524 --> 03:26:34,923
MARISHA: "Solstryce?"

2652
03:26:34,923 --> 03:26:37,460
MATT and TRAVIS: Soltryce.

2653
03:26:37,460 --> 03:26:39,387
MARISHA: Is that the name of the town?

2654
03:26:39,387 --> 03:26:42,859
TALIESIN: No, I don't think it's the name of the
town.

2655
03:26:42,859 --> 03:26:47,598
LAURA: I mean, the ultimate goal, you guys, is to
get to Hupperdook, but--

2656
03:26:47,598 --> 03:26:49,103
TALIESIN: What about Yogurt?

2657
03:26:49,103 --> 03:26:52,186
LAURA: That's an afterthought.

2658
03:26:52,186 --> 03:26:55,086
TALIESIN: It usually is.

2659
03:26:55,086 --> 03:26:57,236
LIAM: How far off does Hupperdook look?

2660
03:26:57,236 --> 03:27:02,762
LAURA: Well, we have to pass through Felderwin and
the Felderwin Village first.

2661
03:27:02,808 --> 03:27:04,416
SAM: Let's skip that one, please.

2662
03:27:04,416 --> 03:27:11,818
LAURA: Oh, is that the one you don't like? Okay,
then we'll go up through Alfield, and then Zadash,

2663
03:27:11,818 --> 03:27:15,448
and then we'll cut across and go to Hupperdook.

2664
03:27:15,448 --> 03:27:17,757
MARISHA: Is that where your clan is from?

2665
03:27:17,757 --> 03:27:20,749
SAM: They roam about.

2666
03:27:20,749 --> 03:27:22,873
ASHLEY: You don't want to go to Zadash, is that
right?

2667
03:27:22,873 --> 03:27:26,777
MARISHA: Nah, it's cool. We can go back.

2668
03:27:26,777 --> 03:27:28,765
TRAVIS: It's cool now?

2669
03:27:28,765 --> 03:27:37,020
MARISHA: Yeah, I mean, there's a few places that I
didn't get to see in my sight-seeing roundabout,

2670
03:27:37,020 --> 03:27:42,320
didn't get to hit everything. Now that I've slept
on it, I've had a change of heart. It's a nice town.

2671
03:27:42,320 --> 03:27:47,677
LAURA: How long of a travel would it be to get to
Zadash from where we are now?

2672
03:27:47,677 --> 03:27:58,295
MATT: Following the road is longer, but it's
safest. That'll probably be close to 200 miles to Zadash.

2673
03:27:58,295 --> 03:28:01,039
SAM: Jesus. We're on foot.

2674
03:28:01,039 --> 03:28:02,709
TALIESIN: No, we've got a cart.

2675
03:28:02,709 --> 03:28:04,028
SAM: A cart.

2676
03:28:04,028 --> 03:28:07,736
MATT: You do have a cart. A single cart.

2677
03:28:07,736 --> 03:28:22,433
LAURA: A horse? Let's go back to the inn and ask
Yorda if she knows if Alfield is a big city.

2678
03:28:22,433 --> 03:28:26,067
LIAM: Do I have any knowledge of Alfield?

2679
03:28:26,067 --> 03:28:28,166
TALIESIN: I came though Alfield, didn't I?

2680
03:28:28,166 --> 03:28:33,164
MATT: No, you guys traveled around. You went from
Felderwin, and curved around to the Ustaloch.

2681
03:28:33,164 --> 03:28:34,519
TALIESIN: That's right.

2682
03:28:34,519 --> 03:28:41,731
MATT: Alfield is actually slightly smaller than
Trostenwald, it's a stop on the way to Zadash.

2683
03:28:41,731 --> 03:28:47,668
Zadash is the second-largest city in the kingdom.

2684
03:28:47,668 --> 03:28:51,344
MARISHA: What do I know about Zadash that I could
tell them? Can I tell them anything?

2685
03:28:51,344 --> 03:28:58,670
MATT: It was the last conquered bastion of the
previous government before the empire entirely

2686
03:28:58,670 --> 03:28:59,911
took the valley.

2687
03:28:59,911 --> 03:29:04,165
MARISHA: That's right. Zadash is on the edge of
the empire too, right?

2688
03:29:04,165 --> 03:29:09,186
MATT: It was, but now it's more central. It
expanded past and took over Trostenwald, Alfield,

2689
03:29:09,186 --> 03:29:11,238
it expanded all the way into the valley.

2690
03:29:11,238 --> 03:29:14,086
LIAM: Will you share your map with me for just
one minute?

2691
03:29:14,086 --> 03:29:15,501
LAURA: Of course.

2692
03:29:15,501 --> 03:29:21,075
SAM: This is a good trick he does. He can look at
it once and it will stay with him forever.

2693
03:29:21,075 --> 03:29:22,658
LAURA: Really?

2694
03:29:22,658 --> 03:29:30,955
SAM: Yes, it's amazing, you can quiz him on it later.
While he's memorizing it, Yasha, is that your name again?

2695
03:29:30,955 --> 03:29:33,081
ASHLEY: Yasha.

2696
03:29:33,081 --> 03:29:35,746
SAM; It's like Ash, with an -ay.

2697
03:29:35,746 --> 03:29:41,107
ASHLEY: Not really, but close enough.

2698
03:29:41,107 --> 03:29:43,156
SAM: I got you these flowers.

2699
03:29:43,156 --> 03:29:44,488
ASHLEY: Oh.

2700
03:29:44,488 --> 03:29:52,530
SAM: Thought that they might gussy you up a bit.
It's a lot of drab colors. Also, maybe you won't

2701
03:29:52,530 --> 03:29:53,978
kill me now.

2702
03:29:53,978 --> 03:29:55,622
ASHLEY: I'm not going to kill you.

2703
03:29:55,622 --> 03:29:57,305
SAM: I know, I gave you the flowers.

2704
03:29:57,305 --> 03:30:00,622
ASHLEY: All right, well.

2705
03:30:00,622 --> 03:30:02,724
SAM: Girls like flowers.

2706
03:30:02,724 --> 03:30:04,104
LAURA: I love flowers, did you get me any?

2707
03:30:04,104 --> 03:30:06,706
SAM: I didn't, because you're less of a threat.

2708
03:30:06,706 --> 03:30:10,274
LAURA: You don't know that.

2709
03:30:10,274 --> 03:30:12,281
ASHLEY: That was very nice of you, thank you.

2710
03:30:12,281 --> 03:30:13,800
SAM: Sure!

2711
03:30:13,800 --> 03:30:16,085
MARISHA: Didn't peg you for a flowers type of
girl.

2712
03:30:16,085 --> 03:30:18,116
SAM: All girls like flowers.

2713
03:30:18,116 --> 03:30:31,501
ASHLEY: I take out a book that I have and in
between some of the pages is a four-leaf clover.

2714
03:30:31,501 --> 03:30:38,829
I'll take the flowers and I'll put them in between
the other pages, and I'll put it away.

2715
03:30:38,829 --> 03:30:40,504
SAM: You see?

2716
03:30:40,504 --> 03:30:44,848
(laughter)

2717
03:30:44,848 --> 03:30:50,126
SAM: It doesn't hurt to be nice sometimes.

2718
03:30:50,126 --> 03:30:52,900
MARISHA: I mean, it can, though.

2719
03:30:52,900 --> 03:30:57,520
SAM: Well it hurts <i>you</i>.

2720
03:30:57,520 --> 03:31:02,414
LIAM: It looks like somebody was very nice to you
the night before, over and over again.

2721
03:31:02,414 --> 03:31:03,739
MARISHA: Oh, she was.

2722
03:31:03,739 --> 03:31:07,251
LAURA: You guys, we are going to Zadash. Is that
what we're saying, we're going to go to Zadash?

2723
03:31:07,251 --> 03:31:10,636
LIAM: Sure, let's do that. What's our goal in
Zadash?

2724
03:31:10,636 --> 03:31:13,936
LAURA: I don't know, I just need to know where
we're going, okay?

2725
03:31:13,936 --> 03:31:15,962
MARISHA: That's on the way to the "Solstryce"
Academy?

2726
03:31:15,962 --> 03:31:29,794
MATT: The Soltryce. Solstice, I can see you mixing
it up. The Soltryce is technically in Rexxentrum,

2727
03:31:29,794 --> 03:31:31,442
which is the capital of the empire.

2728
03:31:31,442 --> 03:31:32,760
LAURA: Which is a lot farther.

2729
03:31:32,760 --> 03:31:40,433
MATT: Which is a lot farther. Zadash does have the
only other subsidiary of the academy there, but

2730
03:31:40,433 --> 03:31:44,559
the main Soltryce academy is in Rexxentrum, the
capital. But Zadash has some connection to it.

2731
03:31:44,559 --> 03:31:45,997
TRAVIS: I'll take it.

2732
03:31:45,997 --> 03:31:50,061
LIAM: Unless you're a foreigner, everyone knows
about Rexxentrum.

2733
03:31:50,061 --> 03:32:00,789
MATT: Yes, it's huge. For player comparison, it's
twice the size of Emon. It's a massive city.

2734
03:32:00,789 --> 03:32:02,419
LAURA: Zadash?

2735
03:32:02,419 --> 03:32:04,193
MATT: No, not Zadash, Rexxentrum.

2736
03:32:04,193 --> 03:32:07,102
LIAM: Zadash is medium, or smaller.

2737
03:32:07,102 --> 03:32:10,325
LAURA: Okay. Yeah.

2738
03:32:10,325 --> 03:32:15,424
LIAM: How far did that map say, when I looked
at it? 200 miles you said to Zadash?

2739
03:32:15,424 --> 03:32:19,507
MATT: To Zadash, roughly 200 miles or so, if
you're taking the road, quicker if you take a

2740
03:32:19,507 --> 03:32:21,085
straight line, but you're not as safe.

2741
03:32:21,085 --> 03:32:28,434
LIAM: Well, I think it's good.

2742
03:32:28,434 --> 03:32:30,991
SAM: Are we going to walk there? Should we get
horses?

2743
03:32:30,991 --> 03:32:32,362
TALIESIN: We have a horse.

2744
03:32:32,362 --> 03:32:33,468
LIAM: How many horses?

2745
03:32:33,468 --> 03:32:34,294
TALIESIN: We have a horse.

2746
03:32:34,294 --> 03:32:39,116
MARISHA: A horse and a carriage. I'm assuming it
can't fit all of us.

2747
03:32:39,116 --> 03:32:40,315
TRAVIS: Yeah, like a wagon.

2748
03:32:40,315 --> 03:32:41,532
TALIESIN: We have a wagon.

2749
03:32:41,532 --> 03:32:46,219
MATT: It'll be about the same pace as on foot. At
a fast pace on foot, you guys can traverse about

2750
03:32:46,219 --> 03:32:53,783
30 miles a day. That also means you're moving at a
fast pace, so you're not being completely aware of

2751
03:32:53,783 --> 03:33:00,270
your surroundings, you have a penalty to passively
seeing things around you. But you get there quicker.

2752
03:33:00,270 --> 03:33:01,633
TRAVIS: I like it.

2753
03:33:01,633 --> 03:33:03,953
TALIESIN: Why be fast? What are we in a rush for?

2754
03:33:03,953 --> 03:33:05,976
LAURA: We can sightsee.

2755
03:33:05,976 --> 03:33:08,155
TALIESIN: I find careful is always best.

2756
03:33:08,155 --> 03:33:12,953
LIAM: A couple of weeks on the road to a city
bigger than this one.

2757
03:33:12,953 --> 03:33:15,442
MARISHA: Are we all going to get along for a
couple of weeks?

2758
03:33:15,442 --> 03:33:16,944
SAM: We'll find out, I suppose.

2759
03:33:16,944 --> 03:33:19,143
LAURA: I get along with everyone, Beau.

2760
03:33:19,143 --> 03:33:20,567
MARISHA: That's true, that's true.

2761
03:33:20,567 --> 03:33:21,845
TALIESIN: I don't get along with anybody.

2762
03:33:21,845 --> 03:33:23,424
MARISHA: That's also true.

2763
03:33:23,424 --> 03:33:31,845
LIAM: Two weeks is not a bad test run for
companions. If we don't like it, we part ways in Zadash.

2764
03:33:31,845 --> 03:33:39,485
TRAVIS: Yeah, free to go at any time. As long as
it serves everyone, we'll stay this way.

2765
03:33:39,485 --> 03:33:53,189
ASHLEY: I think I need to stay here just a little
bit longer. But I will meet you guys there at some point?

2766
03:33:53,189 --> 03:33:57,283
SAM: Why?! What're you doing?

2767
03:33:57,283 --> 03:33:59,119
LIAM: You have something else to do?

2768
03:33:59,119 --> 03:34:07,081
ASHLEY: I just don't think I can leave here until
I'm told I can.

2769
03:34:07,081 --> 03:34:11,358
SAM: By the authorities?

2770
03:34:11,358 --> 03:34:12,987
ASHLEY: No, I just--

2771
03:34:12,987 --> 03:34:15,461
SAM: You're so mysterious

2772
03:34:15,461 --> 03:34:18,630
ASHLEY: I have things that I need to do--

2773
03:34:18,630 --> 03:34:20,347
SAM: Name one.

2774
03:34:20,347 --> 03:34:23,389
TALIESIN: You know where we're headed.

2775
03:34:23,389 --> 03:34:25,750
MATT: Blindspot.

2776
03:34:25,750 --> 03:34:29,802
MARISHA: Poor Ashley, we make her come up with
excuses every time.

2777
03:34:29,802 --> 03:34:41,437
ASHLEY: I have reasons, I can stay, I just need to
converse with somebody to see where my next step leads.

2778
03:34:41,437 --> 03:34:44,387
MARISHA: You know you're not beholden to Gustav
anymore, right?

2779
03:34:44,387 --> 03:34:47,105
ASHLEY: No, yes, no. It's not him.

2780
03:34:47,105 --> 03:34:53,679
MARISHA: Is it Bo? The other Bo? Is it Desmond?

2781
03:34:53,679 --> 03:34:55,194
ASHLEY: No.

2782
03:34:55,194 --> 03:34:56,639
MARISHA: Is it Ornna?

2783
03:34:56,639 --> 03:35:02,401
SAM: Please, Beau, let the detectives figure this
out. Is it Desmond?

2784
03:35:02,401 --> 03:35:05,275
LAURA: Is it Ornna?

2785
03:35:05,275 --> 03:35:07,989
SAM: It's Ornna, isn't it? It's Ornna, I knew it.

2786
03:35:07,989 --> 03:35:09,516
LAURA: Will you hold this?

2787
03:35:09,516 --> 03:35:13,618
SAM: Yes, of course. See? Another case cracked. It
was Ornna.

2788
03:35:13,618 --> 03:35:24,103
LAURA: Before we leave, is there anywhere in town
that there would be a courier service where I could

2789
03:35:24,103 --> 03:35:25,965
send a message?

2790
03:35:25,965 --> 03:35:28,646
MATT: There are messenger services, yeah.

2791
03:35:28,646 --> 03:35:30,165
LAURA: Can I go find one?

2792
03:35:30,165 --> 03:35:36,114
MATT: Yeah, okay. For the purposes of brevity,
we'll say that you find a courier service that

2793
03:35:36,114 --> 03:35:44,784
runs fast horseback all along the roads from the
Empire, and then with approval, outside of it,

2794
03:35:44,784 --> 03:35:46,412
to the south and west.

2795
03:35:46,412 --> 03:35:59,735
LAURA: I'm going to write a letter to my mother
that says, "Dear Mom, all of the money's gone. I

2796
03:35:59,735 --> 03:36:06,869
"don't know what happened, but I am very broke and
I need more. Please help me. I am going to Zadash.

2797
03:36:06,869 --> 03:36:15,540
"That's where you can send it. Just send it to the
inn that is the biggest one and I'll find it

2798
03:36:15,540 --> 03:36:24,805
"there. Just address it to me. Your loving
daughter, Jester. Please, thank you, I need help,

2799
03:36:24,805 --> 03:36:26,219
"thank you."

2800
03:36:26,219 --> 03:36:36,853
MATT: All right. For delivery to Nicodranas, the
cost of the courier service will run you about

2801
03:36:36,853 --> 03:36:38,508
five gold.

2802
03:36:38,508 --> 03:36:44,101
LAURA: This is really fucking-- She better send
money, because this is eating into it.

2803
03:36:44,101 --> 03:36:46,207
MATT: That's hundreds and hundreds of miles on
horseback.

2804
03:36:46,207 --> 03:36:48,452
LAURA: Okay, I'll give the five gold for that.

2805
03:36:48,452 --> 03:36:52,726
TALIESIN: It is such a different world.

2806
03:36:52,726 --> 03:36:58,330
MATT: Yeah. Welcome to level... three, after
tonight.

2807
03:36:58,330 --> 03:37:00,223
SAM: Oh! If we live.

2808
03:37:00,223 --> 03:37:05,127
MARISHA: While we're stopping by the post office,
can I talk to the courier person?

2809
03:37:05,127 --> 03:37:16,913
MATT: Sure. It's a young girl with short-ish
brushed hair, she's boyish and freckled, and a

2810
03:37:16,913 --> 03:37:21,978
bit dirty in the edges of her chin, she's in the
process of loading up the packs on the horse, and

2811
03:37:21,978 --> 03:37:25,926
she's wearing simple leather armor, and looks back
at you. "Can I help you?"

2812
03:37:25,926 --> 03:37:30,391
MARISHA: Yeah, I was just wondering if you had any
incoming mail for the Baumbauchs? I said that I

2813
03:37:30,391 --> 03:37:33,203
would pick it up on the way home, heading over
there.

2814
03:37:33,203 --> 03:37:35,461
MATT: Make a deception check.

2815
03:37:35,461 --> 03:37:37,907
TALIESIN: Wow.

2816
03:37:37,907 --> 03:37:41,314
SAM: Mail fraud on the way out of town.

2817
03:37:41,314 --> 03:37:47,205
MARISHA: That's good! 20. No. Deception? 19
total.

2818
03:37:47,205 --> 03:37:57,096
MATT: "Let me check. Yeah, actually, we've got three
small parcels on the way to the Baumbauchs there."

2819
03:37:57,096 --> 03:38:02,017
MARISHA: Thank you so much. He's going to be so
happy to not have to run this errand. Thank you,

2820
03:38:02,017 --> 03:38:08,060
bye. Oh, sorry, here you go. I give her a gold.

2821
03:38:08,060 --> 03:38:11,088
MATT: "That's very kind, thank you."

2822
03:38:11,088 --> 03:38:12,584
MARISHA: Have a good day.

2823
03:38:12,584 --> 03:38:16,072
MATT: Hops onto the horse and takes off
southward.

2824
03:38:16,072 --> 03:38:18,212
TALIESIN: Mail fraud.

2825
03:38:18,212 --> 03:38:20,524
MARISHA: Let's go.

2826
03:38:20,524 --> 03:38:22,757
TALIESIN: That is actually the worst crime we've
committed today.

2827
03:38:22,757 --> 03:38:26,772
MARISHA: You said how many? Three parcels?

2828
03:38:26,772 --> 03:38:28,450
MATT: Three parcels.

2829
03:38:28,450 --> 03:38:47,211
ASHLEY: When you get to Zadash, maybe send me a
note, or maybe I'll be there. I just have to do a

2830
03:38:47,211 --> 03:38:48,695
couple things.

2831
03:38:48,695 --> 03:38:53,080
LAURA: We'll send you a note on the way to Zadash.
Then maybe you can meet us there.

2832
03:38:53,080 --> 03:38:55,466
ASHLEY: Okay. That sounds like a plan.

2833
03:38:55,466 --> 03:39:02,492
TRAVIS: Do we have our fucking wagon ready?

2834
03:39:02,492 --> 03:39:11,572
TALIESIN: Wagon's ready. I've even attempted to hide
some of the contraband and otherwise. I packed well.

2835
03:39:11,572 --> 03:39:17,689
LIAM: While everyone is getting ready, I wait for
a moment when Fjord is on his own and everyone is

2836
03:39:17,689 --> 03:39:34,256
busy, walk over. This group seems rough around the
edges, but you seem clever. Hopefully we can make

2837
03:39:34,256 --> 03:39:36,048
this work.

2838
03:39:36,048 --> 03:39:42,041
TRAVIS: I think we should be able to, yeah. I
mean, a little guidance goes a long way. You seem

2839
03:39:42,041 --> 03:39:44,137
to be good at looking out for Nott.

2840
03:39:44,137 --> 03:39:50,727
LIAM: I mean, full disclosure, I'm a little rough
around the edges, but you catch my drift.

2841
03:39:50,727 --> 03:39:57,396
TRAVIS: I do. You can trust us. You're safe here.
I'm concerned with what happens with Jester and

2842
03:39:57,396 --> 03:40:02,130
Beau. I think, amongst all of us, we should be
fine.

2843
03:40:02,130 --> 03:40:06,210
LIAM: Let's make it work.

2844
03:40:06,210 --> 03:40:10,037
TRAVIS: We'll make it work.

2845
03:40:10,037 --> 03:40:20,895
SAM: Fjord, something in me says that, for some
reason, you should be the one who tells the horses

2846
03:40:20,895 --> 03:40:22,427
and wagon to go.

2847
03:40:22,427 --> 03:40:26,699
(laughter)

2848
03:40:26,699 --> 03:40:30,686
SAM: It just seems-- you're the biggest, maybe?

2849
03:40:30,686 --> 03:40:39,612
TRAVIS: That is mighty considerate of you, Nott.
Are you sure you don't want to take a crack at it?

2850
03:40:39,612 --> 03:40:46,767
SAM: I could take a crack at it. The wagons be
hitched, hee-haw.

2851
03:40:46,767 --> 03:40:52,951
TRAVIS: Use your diaphragm. Really get a yee-haw,
get in there.

2852
03:40:52,951 --> 03:40:59,354
SAM: Saddle up your doggies, hee-haw.

2853
03:40:59,354 --> 03:41:05,018
TRAVIS: One more time, on the count of three. One,
two, three. On three, I push his chest in.

2854
03:41:05,018 --> 03:41:06,609
SAM: Yee-haw!

2855
03:41:06,609 --> 03:41:19,232
MATT: All right. With that, her vocal expulsion is
majestic and sudden. Make an animal handling check

2856
03:41:19,232 --> 03:41:20,738
with advantage, please.

2857
03:41:20,738 --> 03:41:30,599
SAM: With advantage? Six. I'm still a scary
goblin.

2858
03:41:30,599 --> 03:41:38,242
MATT: The sound that comes out is less of a
"Yee-haw," and more of a screech sound. The horse

2859
03:41:38,242 --> 03:41:44,647
immediately rises up and goes into a very heavy
gallop, and the cart takes off ahead of you, and

2860
03:41:44,647 --> 03:41:52,712
you all struggle to catch up for a bit. With that,
you guys quickly try and saunter up, heading

2861
03:41:52,712 --> 03:42:00,621
northward along the road towards the direction of
Alfield, and eventually Zadash, as you head

2862
03:42:00,621 --> 03:42:05,159
further into the Dwendalian Empire, and whatever
fate has in store for you the next leg of your

2863
03:42:05,159 --> 03:42:10,123
journey. We'll stop tonight's session there.

2864
03:42:10,123 --> 03:42:13,099
SAM: Ashley Johnson, ladies and gentlemen.

2865
03:42:13,099 --> 03:42:14,147
LIAM: Yee-haw.

2866
03:42:14,147 --> 03:42:15,780
ALL: Yee-haw.

2867
03:42:15,780 --> 03:42:22,478
TRAVIS: Well, we committed felonies and mail
fraud. That's good.

2868
03:42:22,478 --> 03:42:24,522
TALIESIN: Quite a few. Got into a bar fight.

2869
03:42:24,522 --> 03:42:27,578
LAURA: We skipped town without paying our inn
fees.

2870
03:42:27,578 --> 03:42:29,209
SAM: We bought drugs.

2871
03:42:29,209 --> 03:42:33,740
TRAVIS: We bought a little bit of mold.

2872
03:42:33,740 --> 03:42:38,047
MATT: You paid your inn fee.

2873
03:42:38,047 --> 03:42:47,410
LAURA: We did pay on the way in. I did pay for a
few days when we got in. I guess that is probably enough.

2874
03:42:47,410 --> 03:42:51,552
LIAM: Oh my gosh, and Sneaky McSneakerson over
here. Oh boy.

2875
03:42:51,552 --> 03:42:55,235
SAM: Oh, yeah. Who knows what Marisha did while we
were out there?

2876
03:42:55,235 --> 03:42:57,855
TRAVIS: Yeah, we got to go back and not watch that
later.

2877
03:42:57,855 --> 03:43:01,198
MARISHA: Like the three rules of Fight Club.

2878
03:43:01,198 --> 03:43:04,115
MATT: You guys are all level three when you come
back next week.

2879
03:43:04,115 --> 03:43:06,666
(cheering)

2880
03:43:06,666 --> 03:43:10,327
TRAVIS: Oh god, we got to shop. We got to book
shop.

2881
03:43:10,327 --> 03:43:12,236
LAURA: Oh man, this is fun.

2882
03:43:12,236 --> 03:43:19,833
MATT: Yeah, thank you guys for sticking around for
a less intense, more character-driven episode,

2883
03:43:19,833 --> 03:43:26,178
these early days of figuring each other out and
forming a fellowship. This is fun, I love it.

2884
03:43:26,178 --> 03:43:27,528
LIAM: Bunch of assholes.

2885
03:43:27,528 --> 03:43:28,520
MATT: I know.

2886
03:43:28,520 --> 03:43:29,900
TALIESIN: Bunch of assholes!

2887
03:43:29,900 --> 03:43:31,230
LIAM: That's the name.

2888
03:43:31,230 --> 03:43:35,581
MATT: Thank you guys for watching. Thank you
again, Deven, for being an incredible artist, and

2889
03:43:35,581 --> 03:43:40,183
an incredible mapmaker for working with me on
that. Her Twitter-- I should've had this prepared

2890
03:43:40,183 --> 03:43:51,952
in advance! You can follow Deven on Twitter
@devenrue, Mistress of Maps. Her work is

2891
03:43:51,952 --> 03:43:58,347
incredible. She has a Patreon, which I'm a patron
for, you should be too. It's her birthday, so say

2892
03:43:58,347 --> 03:43:59,481
happy birthday to her.

2893
03:43:59,481 --> 03:44:00,917

2894
03:44:00,917 --> 03:44:07,078

Ashley, come back.

2895
03:44:07,078 --> 03:44:10,720
ASHLEY: Hopefully soon, I never know. I'll try.

2896
03:44:10,720 --> 03:44:12,296
LAURA: So glad you were here.

2897
03:44:12,296 --> 03:44:18,414
MATT: If anybody from Blindspot is watching right
now, kill off her character. I mean, don't do

2898
03:44:18,414 --> 03:44:20,120
that, but we want her back.

2899
03:44:20,120 --> 03:44:23,852
ASHLEY: I don't think any of them are watching.

2900
03:44:23,852 --> 03:44:29,885
MATT: It's fine. We just miss her a lot. We'll see
you guys back next week. Much love to you, much

2901
03:44:29,885 --> 03:44:32,695
love to you, and is it Thursday yet?
