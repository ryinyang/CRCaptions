1
00:00:00,409 --> 00:00:03,036
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:06,332
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons & Dragons.

3
00:00:06,332 --> 00:00:07,681
LAURA: Oh God!

4
00:00:07,681 --> 00:00:10,012
TRAVIS: We're all a bunch of assholes!

5
00:00:10,012 --> 00:00:11,879
LAURA: That might be the worst one!

6
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:12,862
TALIESIN: Oh man.

7
00:00:12,862 --> 00:00:19,744
MATT: So welcome, Travis and all of you guys.
Before we jump into tonight's game, let's get

8
00:00:19,744 --> 00:00:23,691
through some announcements real fast, so hang
tight with us for a moment. First and foremost

9
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:28,497
tonight, our fantastic returning sponsor for this
campaign beginning and the foreseeable future,

10
00:00:28,497 --> 00:00:31,574
until they decide to vanish in a puff of smoke: It
is D&D Beyond!

11
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:33,069
(cheering)

12
00:00:33,069 --> 00:00:35,136
MATT: Happy to have you guys! Sam, do you have a
few words one that?

13
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:39,071
SAM: D&D Beyond has a mobile app, guys, and it is
out on beta! You can download it now at the App

14
00:00:39,071 --> 00:00:43,486
Store and the Google Play Store-- The Apple App
Store and the Google Play Store. And because

15
00:00:43,486 --> 00:00:50,770
most-- well not most, but a lot of our audience is
located in the United Kingdom, I tailored

16
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:54,478
tonight's D&D Beyond pitch to the British
audience.

17
00:00:54,478 --> 00:00:57,433
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry.

18
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:03,311
SAM: Oi, mates! Have a butcher's and be gobbed by
this brand new D&D Beyond mobile app for your dog

19
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:04,176
'n' bone!

20
00:01:04,322 --> 00:01:05,967
LIAM: Sorry, Kit.

21
00:01:05,967 --> 00:01:11,898
SAM: I know my onions on this and I ain't all
mouth and no trousers! It's a real corker of an

22
00:01:11,898 --> 00:01:18,255
app, and you can nick yours on the Apple App Store
and blimey, the bloody Google Play Store, too! Are

23
00:01:18,255 --> 00:01:24,204
you skint? Tosh! It's free, and that's the dog's
bollocks! You don't got to be minted to get

24
00:01:24,204 --> 00:01:29,727
sorted. There's nothing bent as a nine bob note
about it. You get an ereader with the beta, and

25
00:01:29,727 --> 00:01:33,000
character sheets will be added in the future
tickety-boo!

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,119
LAURA: Wow!

27
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:36,482
SAM: That's a real phrase that I looked up.

28
00:01:36,482 --> 00:01:38,039
MATT: Of course it is.

29
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:44,060
SAM: So don't faff a dozy fortnight. You'll be
right gutted if you do! Oh, sweet fanny adams;

30
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:51,443
don't wag off! Search D&D Beyond at your app store
and you'll be jolly good chuffed about it! Oh now

31
00:01:51,443 --> 00:01:55,748
I'm knackered and cream crackered so I'm off to
Bedfordshire! Pip pip!

32
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:56,877
TRAVIS: Yes!

33
00:01:56,877 --> 00:01:58,901
MATT: Oh wow!

34
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:01,976
TRAVIS: I feel like that was Masterpiece Theatre
all at once.

35
00:02:01,976 --> 00:02:04,513
LIAM: I refuse to applaud that. I refuse.

36
00:02:04,513 --> 00:02:07,417
LAURA: I feel like that would be real hard to do
quickly, so I'm impressed!

37
00:02:07,417 --> 00:02:15,067
MATT: Thank you, Sam, and we're sorry. Also, as a
quick note for you guys, they've begun posting

38
00:02:15,067 --> 00:02:20,721
article content on DnDBeyond.com, which has been
awesome. We've done video content before. Now

39
00:02:20,721 --> 00:02:25,076
they're doing article content as well, editorial,
which our very own James Haeck, who you may know

40
00:02:25,076 --> 00:02:29,253
helped me with the Tal'Dorei campaign guide, a
fantastic writer and a good friend of the show, is

41
00:02:29,253 --> 00:02:33,930
doing stuff there now. He's officially on board
with D&D Beyond, and he's doing the campaign two

42
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,510
summaries right now for the Critical Role
campaign. Those episode recaps will be posted

43
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:42,365
every Friday! Check them out! So awesome
congratulations to you, James, and if you haven't

48

Machina hosted by Brian W Foster, whom I'm tempted
to mess up his name every week because apparently

49
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:22,146
I really-- Anyways, he hosts our fantastic Talks
Machina wrap-up show about today's episode next

00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:40,581
something and something. You got it. Daylight
Savings Time hits the US on Sunday.

53
00:03:40,581 --> 00:03:41,937
TALIESIN: That's not true, is it?

54
00:03:41,937 --> 00:03:42,933
SAM: I didn't know that!

55
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:43,826
TALIESIN: Why would they do that?

56
00:03:43,826 --> 00:03:45,352
MATT: Well, it's on the list if it's not. I don't
know anymore.

57
00:03:45,352 --> 00:03:46,890
TRAVIS: We spring forward.

58
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,620
LAURA: So we lose an hour.

59
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,259
MARISHA: So we lose an hour of sleep.

60
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:56,085
MATT: So check out WhenIsCriticalRole.com for an
update on when Talks Machina and Critical Role

61
00:03:56,085 --> 00:04:00,784
will be live in your timezone if you aren't lucky
enough to be living in the Dark Ages like America

62
00:04:00,784 --> 00:04:03,320
is when it comes to keeping track of your time.

63
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,144
LIAM: Also, if you're watching this episode in
July of 2019, you're welcome.

64
00:04:10,111 --> 00:04:13,963
MATT: The podcast episode of last week's episode
of Critical Role is available now for all your

65
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:20,566
fine downloadable podcast purposes. And there's no
giveaways tonight from Wyrmwood, but

66
00:04:20,566 --> 00:04:24,470
congratulations to our friends at Wyrmwood on the
success of their Adventurer's Arsenal Kickstarter

67
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,305
and to all of the guys who supported it. It looks
really awesome and to all the critters who

68
00:04:28,305 --> 00:04:33,613
supported it, thank you so much and we'll
hopefully be back to giving something next week.

69
00:04:33,613 --> 00:04:39,950
We have a couple other cool announcements. One,
issue five of Vox Machina: Origins is out if you

70
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,312
haven't seen it yet.

71
00:04:41,312 --> 00:04:42,642
MARISHA: Oh man!

72
00:04:42,642 --> 00:04:44,931
TRAVIS: Beat to shit Vax on the front! It's
fucking awesome!

73
00:04:44,931 --> 00:04:46,489
MATT: It's pretty great!

74
00:04:46,489 --> 00:04:48,492
SAM: I still haven't read it! I need to!

75
00:04:48,492 --> 00:04:53,666
MATT: Sam! It's really good. We've already gotten
back a good portion of the art for issue six, the

76
00:04:53,854 --> 00:04:57,156
end of this arc, and it looks really good. If you
haven't had a chance, you can check it out. You

77
00:04:57,156 --> 00:05:02,114
can download it on ComiXology, on the Dark Horse
Comics app, and many other places where fine comic

78
00:05:02,114 --> 00:05:04,412
books are sold digitally.

79
00:05:04,412 --> 00:05:05,436
LIAM: Laserdisc.

80
00:05:05,436 --> 00:05:07,672
MATT: Yes, that too. Let's see.

81
00:05:07,672 --> 00:05:09,706
LAURA: I have an announcement.

82
00:05:09,706 --> 00:05:10,592
MATT: Yes, you do.

83
00:05:10,592 --> 00:05:11,423
LAURA: Is it on the list?

84
00:05:11,423 --> 00:05:12,441
MATT: I think it might be.

85
00:05:12,441 --> 00:05:13,735
LAURA: Okay.

86
00:05:13,735 --> 00:05:20,686
MATT: I will be leaving late tonight,
post-midnight, to fly out to Lexington, Kentucky.

87
00:05:20,686 --> 00:05:22,383
TRAVIS: Oh, gross, really?

88
00:05:22,383 --> 00:05:26,074
MATT: Yeah, but it'll be great. I'll be at the
Lexington Toy and Comic Convention to hang out

89
00:05:26,074 --> 00:05:29,924
with a bunch of you guys out there in Kentucky! If
you haven't already decided to go, and you're in

90
00:05:29,924 --> 00:05:33,288
the vicinity, please come! We'll have panels and
signings and be around. We can hang out, swap

91
00:05:33,288 --> 00:05:34,988
stories, and be general nerds.

92
00:05:34,988 --> 00:05:36,773
LAURA: Are you leaving from here to there?

93
00:05:36,773 --> 00:05:39,621
MATT: I'm leaving from here to home, to pack, and
then leaving.

94
00:05:39,621 --> 00:05:41,229
LAURA: You haven't packed!

95
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:42,877
MATT: I had to finish campaign prep.

96
00:05:42,877 --> 00:05:44,774
LAURA: Oh no, Matthew.

97
00:05:44,774 --> 00:05:52,029
MATT: It's a sprint every day! It'll be fine.
Laura, you had an announcement.

98
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:59,245
LAURA: Yes, I do! Oh my gosh, you guys,
merchandise! Number one, the tarot cards, which a

99
00:05:59,245 --> 00:06:04,700
lot of people have been asking about, are back in
stock right now in the Geek & Sundry store. Number

100
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:11,561
two and three, check out these fabulous, fabulous
T-shirts!

101
00:06:11,561 --> 00:06:13,229
SAM: These are new T-shirts!

102
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:19,554
LAURA: Look at this, our throwback shirt! And we
redid our logo shirt in new sophisticated--

103
00:06:19,554 --> 00:06:23,105
TALIESIN: Darkest timeline Critical Role. Critical
Role darkest timeline.

104
00:06:23,105 --> 00:06:25,345
LAURA: If you're looking for them, they're not in
the store now. We wanted to announce them--

105
00:06:25,345 --> 00:06:26,591
SAM: Wait, they're not?

106
00:06:26,591 --> 00:06:30,609
LAURA: I know. They're going to be available next
Thursday. We're announcing them right now so that

107
00:06:30,609 --> 00:06:32,289
those of you that don't see this live--

108
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:34,078
MARISHA: People on YouTube always get mad at us.

109
00:06:34,078 --> 00:06:37,121
TALIESIN: This is a little love to YouTube. Now
you've got four days to figure your stuff out.

110
00:06:37,121 --> 00:06:40,631
TRAVIS: Think about the Europes and the other
places that are asleeps.

111
00:06:40,631 --> 00:06:43,172
MARISHA: Those people you just addressed.

112
00:06:43,172 --> 00:06:45,395
LAURA: They're going to be there on Thursday next
week.

113
00:06:45,395 --> 00:06:47,995
MATT: Awesome. Thank you, Laura.

114
00:06:47,995 --> 00:06:50,977
LAURA: Thanks, everybody, for talking over my
fucking announcement.

115
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,078
TRAVIS: Hey, it's okay, baby. It's okay.

116
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:56,700
MATT: You got this, Travis. This is all you.

117
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,117
TRAVIS: I know.

118
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,657
MARISHA: Pregnant rage.

119
00:06:59,657 --> 00:07:03,522
LIAM: You son of a bitch!

120
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:08,153
TRAVIS: (pretend cries) You want some pickle
juice?

121
00:07:08,153 --> 00:07:15,477
MATT: Last but not least, we have a cool
announcement for an upcoming event. For those of

122
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:24,192
you who are in, around, or planning to visit
Chicago in April for C2E2, I think pretty much the

123
00:07:24,192 --> 00:07:30,633
whole cast, aside from Ashley who will be filming,
will all be there for Critical Role panels,

124
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:37,506
signing events, all that fun stuff. In Chicago,
April 7th on Saturday and April 8th on Sunday,

125
00:07:37,506 --> 00:07:39,678
we'll be there to party in Chicago.

126
00:07:39,678 --> 00:07:43,809
TRAVIS: Panels and autographs. We loved the
critters that came out to Seattle. Chicago, it's

127
00:07:43,809 --> 00:07:46,018
time to represent.

128
00:07:46,018 --> 00:07:47,689
SAM: I want to taste some bratwurst.

129
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:49,140
MATT: That can be done.

130
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:53,103
SAM: Some beers. I want some Chicago-style pizza.

131
00:07:53,103 --> 00:07:57,261
MATT: Bring all those for Sam at the signing.

132
00:07:57,261 --> 00:08:03,955
LAURA: By the way, this isn't an announcement, but
I think it's important, that I only chose from

133
00:08:03,955 --> 00:08:10,308
dice that were given to me in Seattle for my dice
that I was rolling tonight.

134
00:08:10,308 --> 00:08:16,701
TALIESIN: I may have picked from the remains,
carrion-like, as well.

135
00:08:17,214 --> 00:08:20,784
LIAM: I would like to announce a small amount of
progress for Laura Bailey, who resisted the urge

136
00:08:20,784 --> 00:08:25,349
to keep a super cool d20 for herself, which she
wanted to do. She gave it to me.

137
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:27,034
LAURA: I was ordered to, so yes.

138
00:08:27,034 --> 00:08:28,764
LIAM: Hopefully it stays in my bag.

139
00:08:28,764 --> 00:08:30,108
LAURA: Maybe.

140
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:31,987
MARISHA: I have one final announcement.

141
00:08:31,987 --> 00:08:32,868
MATT: Okay.

142
00:08:32,868 --> 00:08:40,605
MARISHA: Key Question just came out on Tuesday!
It's a show that Key and I created. We talk about

143
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:47,877
Deadpool-- Matt Key! Watch Alpha! For those who
want to watch it and don't want to pay for Alpha,

144
00:08:47,877 --> 00:08:54,099
you can get a free 60 days with the promo code
"question." There were a ton of people who

145
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:59,481
responded to my tweet with the promo code in it
saying, "Yeah, but I don't want to have to pay for

146
00:08:59,481 --> 00:09:09,418
Alpha." You need to read further down the tweet.
I'm telling you now! Promo code Alpha-- no. Promo

147
00:09:09,418 --> 00:09:15,276
code for Alpha: Question. 60 days. Go watch shit.

148
00:09:15,276 --> 00:09:18,372
TRAVIS: Roll a d20 real quick, just for that.

149
00:09:19,114 --> 00:09:21,319
MARISHA: Not bad, I did okay.

150
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:26,207
MATT: The full schedule will be announced for us
at C2E2 early next week. You can buy tickets at

151
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:31,902
c2e2.com, and tomorrow is the deadline to order
badges to receive them by mail, so any badge

152
00:09:31,902 --> 00:09:36,477
orders after that will have to be held at will
call. Just a heads up! I think that's the last of

153
00:09:36,477 --> 00:09:43,279
our announcements. With that, let's jump in to
tonight's episode of Critical Role!

154
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:48,758
[click, TV static]

155
00:09:48,787 --> 00:09:55,716
[groovy Critical Role theme]

156
00:11:06,462 --> 00:11:08,138
MATT: Welcome back.

157
00:11:08,138 --> 00:11:10,390
(laughing)

158
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:24,138
MATT: Welcome back. Last we left off, the newly
decided-upon title for this adventuring group was

159
00:11:24,138 --> 00:11:31,897
announced to Bryce, and as such you are now
referred to as the Mighty Nein.

160
00:11:32,032 --> 00:11:34,085
ALL: Nein!

161
00:11:34,085 --> 00:11:36,564
MATT: The Mighty No, in Zemnian.

162
00:11:36,564 --> 00:11:38,858
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Big nope.

163
00:11:38,858 --> 00:11:47,555
MATT: Upon finishing your business in Alfield, you
acquired your new cart, new horses, and found your

164
00:11:47,555 --> 00:11:53,433
way on the Amber Road northward for a number of
days, making your way toward Zadash. Along the

165
00:11:53,433 --> 00:12:01,818
way, you had some curious naps, you found some
cool little landmarks from a war long past, you

166
00:12:01,818 --> 00:12:12,629
were nearly robbed and instead shooed them off
with cries of extreme syphilis, and then entered

167
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:18,105
the gates of Zadash yourselves. Upon which, you
briefly met a character named Ulysses, who

168
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:24,731
offered, at a bit of cost, to show you around town
for the remainder of the day. Unfortunately, the

169
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:29,976
sun set within the next couple of hours, but you
were led toward the Pentamarket, where you did a

170
00:12:29,976 --> 00:12:34,508
little bit of shopping, offloaded some things
you'd acquired in your previous venture in the

171
00:12:34,508 --> 00:12:40,073
mines where you battled the gnolls, encountered a
purveyor of various magical artifacts named

172
00:12:40,073 --> 00:12:49,345
Enchanter Pumat Sol, acquired some baked goods
from the market, and then finished up by making

173
00:12:49,345 --> 00:12:57,285
your way to The Leaky Tap, where you had just
begun to cross the threshold when we left off last

174
00:12:57,285 --> 00:13:11,282
week. With that, coming in out of the now-cold
night air, mouths filled with various crumbs and

175
00:13:11,282 --> 00:13:18,214
residue of sweets having been consumed on the
walk, you enter the darkened interior of The Leaky

176
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:26,104
Tap. Now, The Leaky Tap itself is a simple, but
very large tavern. You can see there's space here

177
00:13:26,104 --> 00:13:33,162
for at least a dozen tables, and chairs and stools
crowded around. While it lacks decor, it seems to

178
00:13:33,162 --> 00:13:40,657
have charm, with a rather ratty-looking band in
the corner that's playing mostly on-key. It

179
00:13:40,657 --> 00:13:47,351
appears that a number of people who have found
their way-- this is the Eastern Outersteads, I

180
00:13:47,351 --> 00:13:52,784
believe-- have wandered in to spend whatever
coppers they want to throw towards a drink to send

181
00:13:52,784 --> 00:13:58,246
their cares away for the evening, and/or argue
with each other about how better to make the day

182
00:13:58,246 --> 00:14:03,055
before them. Upon stepping into the chamber, you
can see there's already about 25 patrons scattered

183
00:14:03,055 --> 00:14:08,668
amongst the tables, and the evening appears to be
slowly crawling to more of a roar. There's chatter

184
00:14:08,668 --> 00:14:13,001
and whispers, there's laughter and the clanks of
metal and glass. You can see already there's one

185
00:14:13,001 --> 00:14:21,540
long bar on the far end of the room that is broken
in the center for a number of entryway hatches,

186
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:27,972
and two busied bartenders rushing back and forth.
What do you guys want to do?

187
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:39,224
SAM: I, Sam Riegel, want to go back and see Pumat
Sol again. But that would not make narrative

188
00:14:39,224 --> 00:14:40,698
sense.

189
00:14:40,698 --> 00:14:42,777
MATT: There's always tomorrow.

190
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:51,410
MARISHA: Can I do a quick case of the room? See if
I see anybody suspicious?

191
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:54,832
TRAVIS: Give them the old evil eye?

192
00:14:54,832 --> 00:14:57,166
MATT: Make a perception check.

193
00:14:57,943 --> 00:15:00,114
TRAVIS: Come on, first roll of the night.

194
00:15:00,114 --> 00:15:06,611
MARISHA: Perception check. Okay, that's not too
bad. 15.

195
00:15:06,611 --> 00:15:16,298
MATT: 15, okay. Glancing about, most of the
patrons in here range from somewhat dusty,

196
00:15:16,298 --> 00:15:22,671
destitute clothing that looks to be torn and
ragged at the edges. Some can be farm hands, but

197
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:27,774
most of the farm work you've seen is done on the
outskirts of the outer walls of Zadash, but you've

198
00:15:27,774 --> 00:15:31,638
also walked through folks in the street that sit
on the side peddling handcrafted wares and

199
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:38,946
whatever they can muster to try and make ends meet
on the outskirts of the city proper. You notice

200
00:15:38,946 --> 00:15:45,889
two fairly dressed individuals compared to the
rest that are in the process of doing a quick game

201
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:50,816
of cards. You can see a large group of people that
are just beginning to gather and keeping an eye

202
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:54,829
out towards the door if anybody else they
recognize is going to come in. Looks to be about

203
00:15:54,829 --> 00:16:03,804
eight or so strong, with younger half-elf woman or
so who, as you guys enter, sees you, glances over,

204
00:16:03,995 --> 00:16:07,266
then shakes her head and goes back to
conversation.

205
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,505
SAM: Bachelorette party.

206
00:16:08,505 --> 00:16:11,838
MATT: Oh, straight up. You can see the whole
banner on the--

207
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:13,879
MARISHA: Penis necklaces.

208
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:16,725
TRAVIS: Dick whistle. Yeah.

209
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,171
LIAM: Except this is D&D so they're real penises.

210
00:16:19,171 --> 00:16:21,398
MARISHA: Gnoll penises, yeah.

211
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:25,106
MATT: Cast Identify on that.

212
00:16:25,106 --> 00:16:27,744
LIAM: Ten gold a head.

213
00:16:27,744 --> 00:16:32,171
MATT: The attunement process is a little weird.
Anyway.

214
00:16:34,777 --> 00:16:38,200
LIAM: I'm at a bar, that's the way it goes.

215
00:16:39,597 --> 00:16:46,586
MATT: You do see one of the barkeeps leaves behind
and gives a finger off to the other one to pick up

216
00:16:46,586 --> 00:16:54,875
the slack. The one leaving looks to be an elven
woman, what would look to be the equivalent of a

217
00:16:54,875 --> 00:17:01,300
human 40s or so, so who knows how long her actual
elven age is. Looks graceful, looking a bit

218
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:10,362
disheveled, hair pulled back and tied into a small
haphazard bun, simple apron, washing up her hands

219
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:18,916
and toweling them off as she passes off the full
bar to a male dragonborn. White-scaled, plump

220
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:26,213
physique, he himself is wearing a similar apron
with a big smile on his face. He seems jolly,

221
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:30,494
rushing back and forth taking orders, filling
drinks, and looks like even though he's a bit

222
00:17:30,494 --> 00:17:36,148
stressed at the moment, having to take the slack,
is handling it with a smile and is used to the

223
00:17:36,148 --> 00:17:39,053
usual evening ruckus.

224
00:17:39,053 --> 00:17:44,125
MARISHA: And so the two, the dragonborn and the
female elven lady seem to be running the joint.

225
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,489
MATT: They seem to be, yeah.

226
00:17:45,489 --> 00:17:46,555
MARISHA: Copy that.

227
00:17:46,555 --> 00:17:48,189
TRAVIS: I figure we want some drinks and food,
yeah?

228
00:17:48,404 --> 00:17:51,660
LAURA: And also we should rent some rooms.

229
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,179
MARISHA: Hey, Jester, it looks like there's a game
of cards going on over there.

230
00:17:55,179 --> 00:17:58,276
LAURA: Oh, okay, I will--

231
00:17:58,276 --> 00:18:00,248
MARISHA: Just tossing it out there.

232
00:18:00,248 --> 00:18:01,554
LAURA: I will do that.

233
00:18:01,554 --> 00:18:03,500
MARISHA: You don't have to take my--

234
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,143
TRAVIS: Or you could eat first; we've been
traveling--

235
00:18:05,143 --> 00:18:06,337
LAURA: I'm gone.

236
00:18:07,427 --> 00:18:11,453
LIAM: I saw that you were eyeballing the room.
Alles gut?

237
00:18:11,566 --> 00:18:13,080
MARISHA: What?

238
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,462
LIAM: Everything is good?

239
00:18:14,462 --> 00:18:21,820
MARISHA: Yeah, it's fine. Yeah. Seems like a room.
People in it.

240
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,865
LIAM: That is accurate.

241
00:18:22,865 --> 00:18:23,772
MARISHA: Yeah.

242
00:18:23,772 --> 00:18:25,635
TRAVIS: Sir, can I bother you for a second?

243
00:18:25,635 --> 00:18:30,436
MATT: At that point, and hand comes up and he
goes, "Excuse me, just a moment." Fills up two

244
00:18:30,436 --> 00:18:35,878
tankards on the side, slides them down a bit,
grabs a couple silver, pockets it, comes back.

245
00:18:35,878 --> 00:18:37,252
TRAVIS: He's busy.

246
00:18:37,252 --> 00:18:44,138
MATT: Turns back to you, and maybe a good solid
inch or two taller than you, a burly-looking

247
00:18:44,138 --> 00:18:45,112
dragonborn--

248
00:18:45,112 --> 00:18:46,161
TRAVIS: (whistles)

249
00:18:46,161 --> 00:18:47,982
LAURA: He's not that tall. You're not Grog
anymore.

250
00:18:47,982 --> 00:18:50,206
TRAVIS: Who's that?

251
00:18:50,206 --> 00:18:57,061
MATT: With a dangerous-looking front of the snout,
that as soon as it spins to you and he looks at

252
00:18:57,061 --> 00:19:01,273
you with this big, toothy grin, you can see scars
in areas where it's been split in the past. This

253
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:08,307
guy's seen some rough action in his past. But as
soon as the large dragon mouth curls up into this

254
00:19:08,307 --> 00:19:14,022
smile, the golden yellow eyes peeking from behind
these stark white scales, themselves look a bit

255
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:15,288
dusty--

256
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:16,298
LIAM: White scales?

257
00:19:16,298 --> 00:19:19,140
MATT: Yes. "Right, so what can I do for you?"

258
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:23,849
TRAVIS: Yeah, can we just grab any booth or table
that's available? We're looking for some food and

259
00:19:23,849 --> 00:19:24,967
drink this evening.

260
00:19:24,967 --> 00:19:28,753
MATT: "Oh food and drink, I can go ahead and get
started, at least get the order in the kitchen.

261
00:19:28,753 --> 00:19:35,055
Pick a table, sit a spell, rack up. You paying up
front, or you like a tab?"

262
00:19:35,055 --> 00:19:37,767
TRAVIS: I think a tab. Yeah?

263
00:19:37,767 --> 00:19:41,493
TALIESIN: A tab with a conversation of possible
rooms for rent later.

264
00:19:41,493 --> 00:19:46,461
MATT: "Oh. How many rooms you looking? (louder)
I'll be right with you, hold your shit! Yes?"

265
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:48,350
MARISHA: How many rooms you got?

266
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:54,083
MATT: Looks under the counter real fast. Pulls out
a small board.

267
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:57,232
TRAVIS: Three rooms.

268
00:19:57,232 --> 00:20:01,287
MATT: "Oh, we got plenty, we've got like seven of
them open. Three rooms, and a tab under the

269
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:02,645
name--"

270
00:20:04,315 --> 00:20:05,733
SAM and TALIESIN: Nein.

271
00:20:07,877 --> 00:20:09,002
TALIESIN: Nein.

272
00:20:09,002 --> 00:20:09,833
SAM: Just Nein.

273
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,043
TALIESIN: Nein will do.

274
00:20:11,148 --> 00:20:12,841
MATT: "There's six of you."

275
00:20:12,841 --> 00:20:15,414
TALIESIN: N-I-E-N, Nein.

276
00:20:15,513 --> 00:20:21,911
MATT: "Oh, Zemnian. Fucking weird. All right."

277
00:20:21,911 --> 00:20:24,540
LIAM: It is one of the languages of the country.

278
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,510
SAM: It's a lovely language.

279
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,433
MARISHA: What was your name?

280
00:20:29,433 --> 00:20:32,287
MATT: "Me? I'm Wessek the Trim."

281
00:20:32,287 --> 00:20:34,451
MARISHA: Wessek the Trim.

282
00:20:34,451 --> 00:20:36,135
LIAM: Good name.

283
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:37,842
SAM: We have the same middle name!

284
00:20:37,842 --> 00:20:39,740
MATT: "Purveyor of the bar here--"

285
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,779
TALIESIN: Is he, in fact, trim?

286
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:43,827
MATT: No, he is a plump dragonborn.

287
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:45,740
TALIESIN: Just checking if it was an ironic
nickname or not.

288
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:51,611
MATT: He has lived a happy midlife. "I'm purveyor
of drinks and keeper of food here at the Leaky

289
00:20:51,611 --> 00:20:58,372
Tap. Happy to get your food orders in, get some
drinks to your table. Sit back, relax. There's

290
00:20:58,372 --> 00:21:02,761
usually a show at some point in the night."

291
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:06,062
LAURA: I'm hopping over to the card game.

292
00:21:06,062 --> 00:21:13,769
SAM: I'm going to tag along beside her. Hey, do I
see any other goblins in this bar?

293
00:21:13,769 --> 00:21:15,683
MATT: Make a perception check.

294
00:21:16,336 --> 00:21:18,239
SAM: Two.

295
00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:23,297
MATT: No. In fact, from your height, just a lot of
bums.

296
00:21:23,297 --> 00:21:24,659
LAURA: A lot of butts.

297
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:26,502
MATT: A whole lot of butts in there.

298
00:21:26,502 --> 00:21:28,844
SAM: I'm going to assume that I'm okay then.

299
00:21:28,844 --> 00:21:31,441
TRAVIS: Any other half-orcs in this bar?

300
00:21:31,441 --> 00:21:39,052
MATT: You do not see any half-orcs in this bar. As
you go over to the table, the two gentlemen who

301
00:21:39,052 --> 00:21:45,998
are playing cards, you sit down and glance. One of
them looks to be an older man in his 50s or so,

302
00:21:45,998 --> 00:21:54,962
his pattern baldness curling back, but has this
curled mush of brown, now graying, hair on the

303
00:21:54,962 --> 00:22:01,324
outskirts of it. He's wearing a billowing shirt of
a nicer silk. That's why it caught your eye. These

304
00:22:01,324 --> 00:22:04,841
two seem, not extremely well-off by any means, but
at least better than a lot of the other riff-raff

305
00:22:04,841 --> 00:22:07,940
that are finding their way in, including you
guys.

306
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,334
LAURA: My dress is nice, I don't know what you're
talking about.

307
00:22:10,334 --> 00:22:14,042
MATT: Your dress is pretty nice, you're right.
That's true. The other one is in the process of

308
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:21,162
heavily concentrating on his hand. This one looks
a lot younger. He has this scraggly mustache. It

309
00:22:21,162 --> 00:22:27,330
looks like he's probably been growing it since
childhood, and has let it go in its glory. He has

310
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:34,006
a button-up high collar bit and a cravat that has
loosened and fallen. Both of these gentlemen, upon

311
00:22:34,006 --> 00:22:39,322
a closer look, look like they're dressing up
beyond their station, and at the end of the night

312
00:22:39,322 --> 00:22:44,690
have come to alleviate their stresses with drink
and yelling at each other over cards.

313
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:47,442
LAURA: Hop, hop. I sit down.

314
00:22:47,442 --> 00:22:48,668
MATT: "Yes?"

315
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:53,802
LAURA: What are we playing? Are we playing Go
Fish, or War, or--

316
00:22:53,802 --> 00:23:01,235
MATT: They both stop mid-conversation and glance
over. "We're playing whatever suits us at the

317
00:23:01,235 --> 00:23:02,874
moment. We're in the midst-- "

318
00:23:02,874 --> 00:23:05,142
LAURA: What is suiting you right now?

319
00:23:05,142 --> 00:23:11,027
MATT: "Well, we are in the moment finishing a
quick game of poker. If you would be so kind as to

320
00:23:11,027 --> 00:23:15,251
leave us to our game in peace, that would be
appreciated."

321
00:23:15,251 --> 00:23:19,573
LAURA: I will play with you! I'm not very good, so
you can take so much money from me.

322
00:23:19,712 --> 00:23:23,274
MARISHA: Yes! Grift it, girl!

323
00:23:23,274 --> 00:23:25,362
MATT: Make a deception check.

324
00:23:25,492 --> 00:23:31,976
TALIESIN: I am watching this from the table. This
is the show.

325
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:33,809
LAURA: 17.

326
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:40,628
MATT: 17. The younger one, who was talking to you,
glances over to the older gentleman, who's in the

327
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:45,850
process of glancing back, and they take a moment
and they both look back to you together. "I

328
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:49,769
suppose, if you want to buy in, then that is your
choice."

329
00:23:50,379 --> 00:23:53,465
LAURA: You can finish your game though, I'll just
watch.

330
00:23:53,786 --> 00:24:00,325
MATT: They wordlessly continue the game. They
begin arguing over the process of rising prices

331
00:24:00,325 --> 00:24:07,180
between irons coming down from the Druvenlode
city, which is one of the larger mining cities in

332
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:12,895
the empire. They begin to also discuss the quality
of alcohol, seems to be diminishing the more they

333
00:24:12,895 --> 00:24:18,792
drink. Eventually, with one final hand, the
younger one slaps down his cards, and the older

334
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:24,281
one in frustration goes, "Fine! You win."

335
00:24:24,281 --> 00:24:28,303
LAURA: I applaud the younger guy. What do you want
to play, Nott? Do you want to play?

336
00:24:28,303 --> 00:24:31,562
SAM: I'll just watch for now. Do you want me go
get you a drink and bring it back, or are you

337
00:24:31,562 --> 00:24:32,309
okay?

338
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:34,559
LAURA: No, unless you want to get some milk.

339
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,189
SAM: I'll just watch for now.

340
00:24:36,189 --> 00:24:38,320
LAURA: Okay. What is the buy-in?

341
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,490
MATT: "What do you wish to play?"

342
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:43,072
LAURA: What do you wish to play?

343
00:24:45,532 --> 00:24:53,396
MATT: For the sake of ease of the sudden card
game, he looks around at the other guy. "Do you

344
00:24:53,396 --> 00:24:55,156
know the Crick-Queen's Call?"

345
00:24:55,156 --> 00:24:58,767
LAURA: I do! I love it, this is the one I was
telling you about!

346
00:24:58,767 --> 00:24:59,638
SAM: You were?

347
00:24:59,638 --> 00:25:01,347
LAURA: Yeah, remember, with the three cards?

348
00:25:01,347 --> 00:25:02,647
SAM: Oh, yes, I remember.

349
00:25:02,647 --> 00:25:05,341
LAURA: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

350
00:25:05,341 --> 00:25:13,387
MATT: "Very well, then." He goes to shuffle the
cards rather rapidly before he begins dealing out

351
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:15,067
the early sets.

352
00:25:15,067 --> 00:25:16,856
TALIESIN: Is it a clean shuffle?

353
00:25:16,856 --> 00:25:18,386
MATT: You may make a perception check.

354
00:25:18,386 --> 00:25:20,967
LAURA: I would watch that, too. Are you watching
this?

355
00:25:22,307 --> 00:25:24,097
TALIESIN: Nope, I don't see shit.

356
00:25:24,332 --> 00:25:26,448
LAURA: I would be watching this, too, because I'm
kind of a--

357
00:25:26,448 --> 00:25:28,084
MATT: Make a perception check.

358
00:25:28,084 --> 00:25:34,636
LIAM: A question. Is there any rafters, or any
high place in the room behind these gentlemen?

359
00:25:34,636 --> 00:25:41,636
MATT: There are rafters, yeah. It's not a very
high peaked ceiling. The actual roofing element of

360
00:25:41,636 --> 00:25:47,170
this, at least, begins about twelve feet up, and
there's a small space before the beams meet the

361
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,934
top.

362
00:25:48,934 --> 00:25:54,396
LIAM: For the moment I scootch Frumpkin down to the
floor and send him off towards behind these

363
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:57,710
gentlemen to hang around under that spot, for the
moment.

364
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:59,496
MATT: All right.

365
00:25:59,496 --> 00:26:01,788
LAURA: 22 perception.

366
00:26:01,788 --> 00:26:06,008
MATT: It seems to be a clean shuffle, and a clean
deal.

367
00:26:06,008 --> 00:26:11,497
LAURA: Do we put two gold in, or some silver?

368
00:26:11,497 --> 00:26:14,808
MATT: Both the guys look at each other again,
their eyes a little wide. "Two gold would suffice,

369
00:26:14,808 --> 00:26:17,067
yes. Of course."

370
00:26:17,067 --> 00:26:18,758
LAURA: Okay.

371
00:26:18,758 --> 00:26:22,500
MATT: He strokes his way-too-soft mustache.

372
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,735
TRAVIS: Not-all-there mustache.

373
00:26:25,735 --> 00:26:29,632
LIAM: Nott, I think you're too young to be
watching this. You should come sit with me over

374
00:26:29,632 --> 00:26:30,714
here.

375
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,348
SAM: It's very fascinating, though.

376
00:26:32,348 --> 00:26:34,830
LIAM: No, it's a bad idea. You're too little for
gambling.

377
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,879
LAURA: You're not too little, Nott, you're not.

378
00:26:36,879 --> 00:26:43,166
SAM: She doesn't think I am, but if Caleb says so,
then I should go with Caleb. Good luck!

379
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:45,259
LIAM: Use your skill.

380
00:26:45,259 --> 00:26:47,017
LAURA: Okay!

381
00:26:47,017 --> 00:26:51,272
MARISHA: I'm confused. Is she actually that young,
or is that part of the game?

382
00:26:51,272 --> 00:26:53,387
LIAM: Come, let us go sit over here.

383
00:26:53,387 --> 00:26:55,067
MARISHA: Is that part of the scam?

384
00:26:55,067 --> 00:26:56,468
LIAM: I walked away from this one.

385
00:26:56,468 --> 00:27:00,319
MATT: Two gold on the table from each of you, so
that's six gold in the full pot. Go ahead and make

386
00:27:00,463 --> 00:27:02,283
your roll, 3d6.

387
00:27:02,283 --> 00:27:05,836
SAM: Ooh. What do you do, take the best two? What
do you do?

388
00:27:05,836 --> 00:27:07,137
LAURA: No, no, no.

389
00:27:07,137 --> 00:27:09,676
MATT: Everyone rolls, and then you can raise your
ante.

390
00:27:09,676 --> 00:27:15,011
LAURA: Wait. I'm going to try to use one of my own
cards and try to replace one of the cards.

391
00:27:15,011 --> 00:27:16,635
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.

392
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:20,415
LIAM: Frumpkin climbs up into the rafters with a
view of the gentleman's cards.

393
00:27:20,415 --> 00:27:21,364
LAURA: 19.

394
00:27:21,364 --> 00:27:23,587
MATT: 19? Okay.

395
00:27:23,587 --> 00:27:26,672
TALIESIN: Can I try to perceive this too?

396
00:27:26,672 --> 00:27:29,743
MATT: Sure, make a perception check.

397
00:27:33,098 --> 00:27:34,083
TALIESIN: 18.

398
00:27:34,088 --> 00:27:41,834
MATT: No, you do not. They all look at their
hands. The younger one with the mustache keeps

399
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:50,694
stroking the front of his face and goes, "I'll
raise four." You don't roll yet. You have to raise

400
00:27:50,694 --> 00:27:51,553
first.

401
00:27:51,553 --> 00:27:54,409
LAURA: I thought I was trying to cheat and replace
one of my things.

402
00:27:54,409 --> 00:27:55,903
MATT: Oh, you were. Yes, you're right.

403
00:27:55,903 --> 00:27:57,862
LAURA: Do I get to choose what it is, or do I roll
again?

404
00:27:57,862 --> 00:27:59,198
MATT: You just roll again.

405
00:27:59,198 --> 00:28:02,837
LAURA: Okay. I rolled it. It was shit. Okay.

406
00:28:02,837 --> 00:28:08,739
MATT: He goes, "Raising an additional two gold
pieces."

407
00:28:08,739 --> 00:28:13,268
LIAM: I would like to start looking at their cards
through Frumpkin's eyes.

408
00:28:14,948 --> 00:28:20,379
LAURA: I'm definitely raising two. From your two,
I'm going to add in another three. So five extra

409
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,342
on the table.

410
00:28:23,292 --> 00:28:25,603
LIAM: (quietly) Get ready to use your wire.

411
00:28:25,626 --> 00:28:31,802
SAM: Okay. I'm pulling out my thin bit of wire and
I'm getting ready to cast Message.

412
00:28:31,802 --> 00:28:36,157
TRAVIS: We just can't have a fucking peaceful
drink, can we? Just got to get right into shit.

413
00:28:36,157 --> 00:28:37,366
Okay.

414
00:28:37,366 --> 00:28:46,251
MATT: I know. All right. They meet your raise.
That's now 21 gold, I believe, on the table, so

415
00:28:46,251 --> 00:28:49,444
you all get to draw another card. So reroll one more.

416
00:28:54,178 --> 00:28:56,147
The older one--

417
00:28:58,749 --> 00:28:59,778
SAM: Folds?

418
00:28:59,778 --> 00:29:01,478
MATT: No, he stays.

419
00:29:01,478 --> 00:29:03,817
LAURA: Okay. The younger one?

420
00:29:03,817 --> 00:29:06,069
MATT: Perception check.

421
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,982
LIAM: Yeah. That's a 21.

422
00:29:11,982 --> 00:29:14,303
MATT: 21. Yeah, you can see.

423
00:29:14,303 --> 00:29:16,300
LAURA: I'll cover my ears so I don't know.

424
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,160
SAM: You're about to know when I whisper it to
you.

425
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,678
LAURA: Oh, okay. Never mind.

426
00:29:20,678 --> 00:29:25,091
MATT: The younger one has a crap hand. He's trying
to bluff and he's already sweating a bit. The

427
00:29:25,091 --> 00:29:27,984
older one is looking really good.

428
00:29:27,984 --> 00:29:36,112
LIAM: Okay. Tell our friend that Mr. Mustache is
sitting pretty and the young boy has Scheiße.

429
00:29:36,347 --> 00:29:38,403
MATT: Well, the mustache is the younger one. The
older one is--

430
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:43,834
LIAM: Reverse that order please. Also, I would
like the curly fries.

431
00:29:44,425 --> 00:29:49,388
SAM: I point to her and whisper in my bit of
copper wire and do a little hand gesture, and say

432
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:55,864
all of that to her. The young one's bluffing! The
old one's got a sick hand! He's going to burn you!

433
00:29:55,864 --> 00:29:57,657
Burn you good!

434
00:29:57,657 --> 00:30:03,248
LAURA: Hmm. I'm going to sleight of hand and try
and replace one of my cards.

435
00:30:03,248 --> 00:30:05,833
TRAVIS: Jesus! In one game?

436
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:12,362
MATT: All right, so go attempt it again. Go and
roll a deception-- or sorry sleight of hand.

437
00:30:12,362 --> 00:30:14,277
LAURA: Oh god.

438
00:30:14,277 --> 00:30:16,350
MATT: You guys are so honed in on this!

439
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,906
LAURA: Oh, 16?

440
00:30:21,756 --> 00:30:22,917
TRAVIS: Oh no.

441
00:30:23,466 --> 00:30:30,206
MATT: The young guy is sweating a bit and he gets
more nervous. He just continues to stroke his

442
00:30:30,206 --> 00:30:37,390
little caterpillar mustache, quicker and smaller
bits. The older guy who seems to be playing rather

443
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:51,640
spacey the whole time suddenly zooms in on your
hands and goes, "I do say, I think we're being

444
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,967
had."

445
00:30:52,967 --> 00:30:55,069
LAURA: What, by who?

446
00:30:55,069 --> 00:31:02,594
MATT: He leans forward and pulls one of the cards
that you had slipped into your sleeve, out onto

447
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:05,108
the table.

448
00:31:05,108 --> 00:31:11,728
LAURA: Oh, that's weird where did that come from?
I shouldn't wear such loose sleeves, you guys.

449
00:31:11,728 --> 00:31:13,967
That was really obvious.

450
00:31:13,967 --> 00:31:20,723
MATT: The old guy stands up and leans forward. You
can see he has this bloodshot corners, a little

451
00:31:20,723 --> 00:31:27,478
bit where the white show for deep brown irises.
The smell of alcohol and dirt wafts off of him as

452
00:31:27,478 --> 00:31:36,221
he leans forward. "I will not report you for
cheating, but we will taking the rest of the pot."

453
00:31:36,464 --> 00:31:39,877
LAURA: Wait, cheating? What are you talking
about?

454
00:31:39,877 --> 00:31:41,950
MATT: He just takes the coins and scoops them up.

455
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:44,832
LAURA: Wait, I thought that was part of the game.
Is it not?

456
00:31:44,832 --> 00:31:46,412
MATT: They get up and leave.

457
00:31:46,412 --> 00:31:49,030
LAURA: Motherfuckers, they took my money.

458
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,895
SAM: Did you win?

459
00:31:51,007 --> 00:31:53,321
LAURA: Yes Nott, I won real good.

460
00:31:53,321 --> 00:31:55,305
SAM: I knew you would.

461
00:31:55,305 --> 00:31:59,254
LAURA: I only lost seven gold. That was a lot of
fun, you guys. That was a good trick with the

462
00:31:59,254 --> 00:32:00,567
messages!

463
00:32:00,567 --> 00:32:03,368
SAM: It didn't seem to help very much, though.

464
00:32:03,368 --> 00:32:08,161
LAURA: No, but it would have if I had succeeded in
these-- gosh I really need to get tighter sleeves,

465
00:32:08,161 --> 00:32:09,220
though.

466
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,986
LIAM: Yeah, but that one had potential.

467
00:32:11,986 --> 00:32:14,393
LAURA: Molly, you have to teach me how to do that
better, okay?

468
00:32:14,393 --> 00:32:16,770
TRAVIS: She wants to play again, right now.

469
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,049
LAURA: What?

470
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:21,202
TRAVIS: What? I said you want to play again, don't
you?

471
00:32:21,202 --> 00:32:22,750
LAURA: (laughing) So bad.

472
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:25,072
TRAVIS: Yeah Laura's dying on the inside.

473
00:32:25,072 --> 00:32:26,716
LAURA: (yells)

474
00:32:26,812 --> 00:32:28,993
SAM: Should we follow them outside and kill them?

475
00:32:28,993 --> 00:32:30,795
LAURA: Ooh. No, probably not.

476
00:32:30,795 --> 00:32:31,970
TALIESIN: That doesn't seem very nice.

477
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:34,111
LIAM: Why don't instead we have something to drink
and eat.

478
00:32:34,111 --> 00:32:36,276
TRAVIS: I agree with you 100%.

479
00:32:36,276 --> 00:32:37,718
LAURA: You know what else we should do?

480
00:32:37,718 --> 00:32:39,309
TALIESIN: Follow them outside and rob them?

481
00:32:39,309 --> 00:32:40,633
TRAVIS: Molly, come on now.

482
00:32:40,633 --> 00:32:41,503
TALIESIN: Sorry.

483
00:32:41,503 --> 00:32:42,419
LAURA: Did we get rooms?

484
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:43,286
TALIESIN: We did get rooms.

485
00:32:43,286 --> 00:32:44,345
LAURA: Yay. Are we roommates?

486
00:32:44,345 --> 00:32:45,501
MARISHA: Roomies!

487
00:32:45,501 --> 00:32:49,426
MATT: Dinner arrives, drinks have been provided.
You guys are able to use your meal and figure out

488
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:52,174
who you want to talk to, what you want to do, your
business.

489
00:32:52,174 --> 00:32:53,986
LAURA: We should look for Claudia.

490
00:32:53,986 --> 00:32:57,264
SAM: We were told that there was Claudia Sheet
here.

491
00:32:57,264 --> 00:32:58,110
LAURA: Sheed.

492
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,479
SAM: Sheed. Sheedy. Ally Sheedy is here.

493
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,296
MARISHA: Oh I love her.

494
00:33:02,296 --> 00:33:04,104
TRAVIS: Sheed or Sheen?

495
00:33:04,104 --> 00:33:05,026
MATT: Sheed.

496
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:06,348
SAM: Charlie Sheen.

497
00:33:06,348 --> 00:33:11,127
LIAM: Only I get to say Schiet, you have to say
Sheed.

498
00:33:11,127 --> 00:33:16,993
SAM: She's probably the elven woman working at the
bar since we were told she works here, right?

499
00:33:16,993 --> 00:33:18,120
TALIESIN: Claudia Sheed?

500
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,044
LAURA: Yeah.

501
00:33:19,044 --> 00:33:19,847
TALIESIN: Claudia Sheed.

502
00:33:19,847 --> 00:33:20,584
LAURA: Let's ask about--

503
00:33:20,584 --> 00:33:21,805
TALIESIN: (yelling) Claudia Sheed!

504
00:33:21,805 --> 00:33:24,057
TRAVIS: Yeah, go get her, Molly.

505
00:33:24,057 --> 00:33:30,493
MATT: As you're shouting this out, some people
start looking over, curious as this very

506
00:33:30,493 --> 00:33:36,950
ostentatiously dressed tiefling starts shouting
essentially the owner of the tavern out in the

507
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:45,671
center of the tavern. No one seems to make any
physical action towards it. However, Wessek points

508
00:33:45,671 --> 00:33:49,998
over towards you. "Oh, she took some time off.
She's up in her office, sorry."

509
00:33:49,998 --> 00:33:51,760
TALIESIN: Brilliant, thank you.

510
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,178
TRAVIS: That was very effective.

511
00:33:54,178 --> 00:33:59,836
TALIESIN: I normally find shouting people's names
really loudly tends to bring them to your table.

512
00:33:59,836 --> 00:34:04,890
TRAVIS: Right. I wonder where her office is.

513
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:06,185
LAURA: We could ask.

514
00:34:06,185 --> 00:34:09,829
TALIESIN: We could look. Have we had food and
drink yet?

515
00:34:09,829 --> 00:34:14,828
MATT: Yeah, you guys have eaten. And now you're in
the process-- you don't have to roleplay every meal.

516
00:34:14,828 --> 00:34:17,131
(various eating noises)

517
00:34:17,131 --> 00:34:20,061
TRAVIS: Nott has to roleplay every meal.

518
00:34:20,061 --> 00:34:24,142
LIAM: What time of the evening do I know it to
be?

519
00:34:24,142 --> 00:34:28,712
MATT: At this point, it's probably pushing close
to ten o'clock.

520
00:34:28,712 --> 00:34:31,054
LIAM: Ja, okay.

521
00:34:31,054 --> 00:34:33,005
MATT: The sun's been set for a couple hours.

522
00:34:33,005 --> 00:34:34,511
LIAM: Yeah, that's late. It's not that late.

523
00:34:34,511 --> 00:34:37,681
TRAVIS: Anybody feel like going up and giving ole
Claudia a door rap, at her office?

524
00:34:37,681 --> 00:34:40,075
LIAM: I thought you were going somewhere else, for
a second.

525
00:34:40,075 --> 00:34:41,194
TRAVIS: No.

526
00:34:41,194 --> 00:34:45,906
TALIESIN: I'm interested either way. So I'm going
to stand up and start heading upstairs.

527
00:34:45,906 --> 00:34:48,502
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm bored. Let's go.

528
00:34:48,502 --> 00:34:51,140
TALIESIN: Come, Unpleasant One, let's go.

529
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:58,099
MARISHA: All right. Obnoxious One, I'm with you.

530
00:34:58,099 --> 00:35:03,353
MATT: There's a brief spiral staircase towards the
far back that leads to a landing and then the

531
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:07,814
second floor. From the outside, you could see 
there were three floors to it. So this probably

532
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:11,680
progresses-- there's another staircase further
down the hallway. From the landing up there,

533
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,317
there's a single doorway that is currently closed.
It has no name on it, but it stands alone from the

534
00:35:16,317 --> 00:35:19,386
rest of it, and it seems to be in the direction as
to where Wessek was pointing.

535
00:35:19,386 --> 00:35:27,168
TALIESIN: I'm going to look for what looks like an 
office. For whatever door seems most inconvenient.

536
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:29,906
MATT: At a quick glance, the one on the landing.

537
00:35:29,906 --> 00:35:31,454
TALIESIN: The one on the landing it is.

538
00:35:31,454 --> 00:35:33,799
TALIESIN and MARISHA: (click and knock the same
pattern)

539
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:35,171
SAM: What the fuck was that?

540
00:35:35,171 --> 00:35:36,847
TRAVIS: Wow, y'all.

541
00:35:36,847 --> 00:35:45,242
MATT: We've been hanging out far too long. This is
a problem. There's a moment. "Yes, who is it?"

542
00:35:45,242 --> 00:35:47,998
TALIESIN: Friends from out of town.

543
00:35:47,998 --> 00:35:52,468
MATT: "More information, please."

544
00:35:52,468 --> 00:35:55,316
TALIESIN: Bryce sent us.

545
00:35:55,316 --> 00:35:57,856
MATT: "Bryce who?"

546
00:35:57,856 --> 00:36:00,842
LAURA: Bryce from Alfield.

547
00:36:00,842 --> 00:36:01,953
SAM: You're not there.

548
00:36:01,953 --> 00:36:03,710
LAURA: Yes, I am. We went up there, I thought.

549
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,245
MARISHA: Crownsguard Bryce.

550
00:36:05,245 --> 00:36:06,812
TALIESIN: From Alfield.

551
00:36:06,812 --> 00:36:17,828
MATT: "All right, just a moment, please." About 30
or so seconds pass and the door opens, and the same

552
00:36:17,828 --> 00:36:23,441
elven woman you saw leave from behind the bar
earlier. However, the disheveled appearance you saw

553
00:36:23,441 --> 00:36:30,611
earlier is gone, is pristine, clean and the hair
is immaculately combed and pulled up into a high

554
00:36:30,611 --> 00:36:38,797
bun, wearing a deep maroon, almost a silk robe
that is pulled over, arms across.

555
00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:44,250
LAURA: I was desanitizing him.

556
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:48,413
MATT: Oh, fair enough. "So you are friends of
Bryce."

557
00:36:48,413 --> 00:36:52,228
TALIESIN: We have come from very far to take a look--

558
00:36:52,228 --> 00:36:53,262
MARISHA: Converse.

559
00:36:53,262 --> 00:36:54,168
TALIESIN: Converse.

560
00:36:54,168 --> 00:36:55,273
MARISHA: Right?

561
00:36:55,273 --> 00:36:58,901
MATT: "Well, they are a very good friend. And if
you are friends of them, then you are friends of

562
00:36:58,901 --> 00:37:06,506
"mine. I ask you to enter for the time being and
perhaps we can get to know each other, I suppose,

563
00:37:06,506 --> 00:37:13,012
"if you have business. Enter, please." She turns and
whips around and heads back inside. This office is

564
00:37:13,012 --> 00:37:19,317
a simple office. When you consider most of the
offices you've encountered have been in some level of

565
00:37:19,317 --> 00:37:28,191
empire clerical work, and/or in various
institutions, this is mainly just a desk with a

566
00:37:28,191 --> 00:37:33,452
chair, some books and ledger information, some
scattered papers, ink and quill, a few books on

567
00:37:33,452 --> 00:37:38,933
the side. Other than that, it's pretty barren and
simple. There is a window in the back that has a

568
00:37:38,933 --> 00:37:46,418
crossbeam bisecting it into four squares. It is just
pitch black outside 'cause the rest of it is just

569
00:37:46,418 --> 00:37:51,498
an alley below. Anyway, she turns around and sits
in the chair and comes back, and crosses her hands

570
00:37:51,498 --> 00:37:57,382
in front of her with her elbows on the edge of the
table. "All right, you have my attention. What can

571
00:37:57,382 --> 00:37:58,959
"I do for you?"

572
00:37:58,959 --> 00:38:08,845
TALIESIN: Well, to wrap it up a bit, we've just
recently got into town. We're looking for

573
00:38:08,845 --> 00:38:15,670
employment, odd jobs. We were recommended to you
to be the person to talk to about what actually is

574
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:21,078
going on in this city. We're new to this city, we
don't necessarily have our thumb on the pulse of

575
00:38:21,078 --> 00:38:22,324
what's going on.

576
00:38:22,324 --> 00:38:31,261
MATT: "You are here looking for work? Well, for
one, if you are in need of paying work, I always

577
00:38:31,261 --> 00:38:41,013
"have dishes to wash. But at a quick glance at how
you are presented as a little more capable

578
00:38:41,013 --> 00:38:46,741
"individuals at first glance, I would say that
perhaps you have other skills. So I would--"

579
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:53,300
MARISHA: I do the dude at a bar thing and push up
my biceps.

580
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:57,054
TRAVIS: It works.

581
00:38:57,054 --> 00:39:02,961
MATT: "If you are better with a blade or
information, then checking at the King's Hall Board

582
00:39:02,961 --> 00:39:04,763
"might be a solid bet for you."

583
00:39:04,763 --> 00:39:09,789
TALIESIN: We just figured we would make sure that
you were aware we were here. We don't want to

584
00:39:09,789 --> 00:39:14,134
ruffle any feathers and we don't necessarily know
who are the right people, the wrong people to work for.

585
00:39:14,134 --> 00:39:18,596
MATT: "Every person you meet is the right and the
wrong person, depending on where you are coming from."

586
00:39:18,596 --> 00:39:19,998
TALIESIN: That's very fair.

587
00:39:19,998 --> 00:39:22,592
MATT: "I guess I would ask what for you is the
wrong type of people?"

588
00:39:22,592 --> 00:39:25,339
LAURA: Shitty people.

589
00:39:25,339 --> 00:39:31,167
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'd like to avoid entanglements
with the law, being so new and all.

590
00:39:31,167 --> 00:39:36,222
MATT: "Right, then perhaps do not punch any
crownsguard and I think you'll be okay."

591
00:39:36,222 --> 00:39:39,389
TALIESIN: Sounds easy, except it's really not.

592
00:39:39,389 --> 00:39:43,441
MARISHA: It does seem like crownsguard tend to be
assholes.

593
00:39:43,441 --> 00:39:45,194
TALISIN: Deeply punchable.

594
00:39:45,194 --> 00:39:49,358
MARISHA: Have you ever had any issues with the
Crownsguard? We've heard rumors.

595
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:55,192
MATT: "I mean, individuals, yes." There's a brief
moment where she looks wistfully into the

596
00:39:55,192 --> 00:40:06,705
distance. "I've had my encounters, not so much
with Crownsguard, but with other figures."

597
00:40:06,705 --> 00:40:09,690
MARISHA: Do we need to kick someone's ass for
you?

598
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:13,078
MATT: "Oh, I've already made sure their ass has
been thoroughly kicked."

599
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:17,415
TRAVIS: Maybe it might be wise to ask
any particular groups to avoid while we're here.

600
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:31,437
MATT: She crosses her arms for a second.
"Interesting point. Where are you from? Have you

601
00:40:31,437 --> 00:40:33,647
"always lived in the empire?"

602
00:40:33,647 --> 00:40:38,860
LAURA: No, I'm from-- you're from Port Damali.
I'm from Nicodranas.

603
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:48,473
MATT: "From the Menagerie Coast. You are in for a
treat of comparably colorful times. But a probably

604
00:40:48,473 --> 00:41:02,129
"less jovial atmosphere in places. You know about
the religious control, correct?"

605
00:41:02,129 --> 00:41:04,632
TRAVIS: We're slightly aware.

606
00:41:04,632 --> 00:41:05,988
LAURA: Wait, what?

607
00:41:05,988 --> 00:41:07,497
TRAVIS: Well, they frown--

608
00:41:07,497 --> 00:41:09,384
TALIESIN: Grace of the Platinum Dragon.

609
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:21,084
MATT: "There are-- for well over a century now, the
worship of various deities in the empire has been

610
00:41:21,084 --> 00:41:30,422
"controlled. There are shrines throughout the city.
Most cities contain a shrine of some kind to the

611
00:41:30,422 --> 00:41:36,598
"approved worships. I just want to ensure that, if
you do not fall into this realm, you do not go

"flashing it about, because that will get you very
easily put into the Umber Dungeon and that is not

613
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,101
"a place you want to be."

614
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:45,350
LAURA: Where are these shrines that you are
talking about?

615
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:52,226
MATT: "They are scattered about. For instance,
there is the Allhammer. Their shrine is-- let me

616
00:41:52,226 --> 00:41:54,971
"think for a second," as I consult my notes.

617
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:57,698
TRAVIS: Yeah, getting the good shit right now.

618
00:41:57,698 --> 00:41:59,950
MARISHA: The Umber Dungeon?

619
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:06,698
MATT: The Umber Dungeon. "There is the Hearth of
the Allhammer that is existing in the Pentamarket."

620
00:42:06,698 --> 00:42:09,358
LAURA: Ooh, we were just there!

621
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:17,991
MATT: "Look for the domed iron structure. It may
be a bit rusty, not in the best upkeep. It's hard

622
00:42:17,991 --> 00:42:23,472
"to miss the interior with the very heavy,
beautiful anvil, for both craftwork of those that

623
00:42:23,472 --> 00:42:30,955
"maintain a position. What else do you want
to know about it? There is the Raven's Den, which

624
00:42:31,123 --> 00:42:32,940
is in the center of the graveyard."

625
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,438
LAURA: That sounds good, too.

626
00:42:34,438 --> 00:42:43,824
MATT: "The Ossuary Gates is the multilayered
catacomb graveyard. The Raven's Den exists in the

627
00:42:43,824 --> 00:42:45,540
"center area of that field."

628
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:51,190
LAURA: Do the shrines usually have a lot of people
in them?

629
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:54,926
MATT: "Midday, and depending on which places of
worship they are, yes. But there are Heralds that

630
00:42:54,926 --> 00:43:03,958
"run each shrine; they work for the empire. They
hold all sermons. They give council to anybody who

631
00:43:03,958 --> 00:43:09,385
"requires it. It's all pretty much within the
government structure, yes."

632
00:43:09,385 --> 00:43:15,440
TRAVIS: Are there any particular groups of people
that are responsible for unsavory business in the

633
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,416
city? Any identifying clothing or memorabilia they
might have on them?

634
00:43:20,416 --> 00:43:24,710
MATT: "Not visibly, no. There are many people that
work underneath the law here, but they are careful

635
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:30,413
"enough, if they wish to continue business, to not
show it. I mean, what, are you looking for that

636
00:43:30,413 --> 00:43:31,536
"kind of work?'

637
00:43:31,536 --> 00:43:35,963
TRAVIS: No, just perhaps to keep an eye out for in
case we sought employment from the wrong type.

638
00:43:35,963 --> 00:43:40,407
MARISHA: You know, tourists. We have that tourist
look.

639
00:43:40,407 --> 00:43:46,425
TALIESIN: Speaking of tourist looks, how much of a
problem would this be in general?

640
00:43:46,425 --> 00:43:51,435
MATT: "You should be fine. It's-- you should be
fine."

641
00:43:51,435 --> 00:43:53,132
TALIESIN: Excellent.

642
00:43:53,132 --> 00:44:02,774
MATT: "For the most part, those of various unique
heritages have harder times at the farther

643
00:44:02,774 --> 00:44:12,034
"eastern areas, around the garrisons. Those that
have to keep the creatures of Xhorhas at bay, and

644
00:44:12,034 --> 00:44:18,193
"possibly historians that believe that this is the
Curse of Ghor Dranas, but you know. For the most

645
00:44:18,193 --> 00:44:24,155
"part, most nobody studies history and just consider
you either unique-looking or will avoid you regardless."

646
00:44:24,155 --> 00:44:31,380
MARISHA: Wait, no one studies history, really? Do
you not have a good public school system or

647
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,248
something? I was just curious.

648
00:44:33,248 --> 00:44:41,085
MAT: "Well, if you want to go study history--" that
would be over here. "In the Interstead Sprawl, we

649
00:44:41,085 --> 00:44:49,343
"do have the Apple Tree Tutor Village. That is
three long buildings owned and provided by the

650
00:44:49,343 --> 00:44:56,831
"Soltryce Academy for basic learning to children
and adults of the less affluent lifestyle for a

651
00:44:56,831 --> 00:44:58,467
"moderate price."

652
00:44:58,467 --> 00:45:02,768
MARISHA: Like private school?

653
00:45:02,768 --> 00:45:10,136
MATT: If you're looking for a comparison here, it
would be upper-end public school, if anything.

654
00:45:10,136 --> 00:45:12,939
LIAM: Charter school?

655
00:45:12,939 --> 00:45:14,441
MARISHA: Magnet programs?

656
00:45:14,441 --> 00:45:15,848
MATT: Sure, we'll put it at a charter school.

657
00:45:15,848 --> 00:45:17,662
LIAM: Lotteries are a bitch!

658
00:45:17,662 --> 00:45:20,018
MATT: But controlled by the Soltryce Academy.

659
00:45:20,018 --> 00:45:22,118
MARISHA: All controlled by the Soltryce.

660
00:45:22,118 --> 00:45:29,765
MATT: Yes. "The head tutor there is an overworked
and relatively stressed-out individual."

661
00:45:29,765 --> 00:45:31,418
TRAVIS: Head tutor, you said?

662
00:45:31,418 --> 00:45:41,872
MATT: "Yes. Mikael Drom. Very nice fellow. Eager
to help, but the system has been difficult for him."

663
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:44,796
TALIESIN: Is there a shrine to the Dragon, as
well?

664
00:45:44,796 --> 00:45:58,191
MATT: "There is. There is a Platinum House. That
would also be in the Interstead Sprawl. Look for

665
00:45:58,191 --> 00:46:01,082
"the beautiful white building with deep blue
tapestries on the outside. They're reflective,

666
00:46:01,082 --> 00:46:06,611
"mirror-like, during the day. It's almost a beacon
for having to shield your eyes. Meditation,

667
00:46:06,611 --> 00:46:11,919
"worship, is all available within there. Sermon's
usually around noon."

668
00:46:11,919 --> 00:46:18,727
MARISHA: You mentioned all the sanctioned shrines.
Are there any unsanctioned shrines?

669
00:46:18,727 --> 00:46:26,821
MATT: "Anything that isn't the Platinum Dragon,
the Raven Queen, Allhammer, Dawnfather, Lawbearer,

670
00:46:26,821 --> 00:46:28,770
"and the Knowing Mistress."

671
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:30,203
MARISHA: So six, that's it?

672
00:46:30,203 --> 00:46:31,575
MATT: "There are six."

673
00:46:31,575 --> 00:46:36,270
MARISHA: Six approved gods.

674
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:41,228
LAURA: All of those guys. Of course we knew about
those guys.

675
00:46:41,228 --> 00:46:45,184
TRAVIS: Jester, now, that doesn't seem to cover
who you're looking for, though.

676
00:46:45,184 --> 00:46:48,130
LAURA: Oh, well, you know--

677
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:53,871
MATT: "I don't judge. If you worship what you want,
you can, just be careful about it."

678
00:46:53,871 --> 00:46:55,151
LAURA: Okay.

679
00:46:55,151 --> 00:46:56,756
MATT: "Don't tell anyone."

680
00:46:56,756 --> 00:46:58,584
TALIESIN: Ixnay on the angers-stray.

681
00:46:58,584 --> 00:47:01,505
LAURA: Okay! I won't tell anyone.

682
00:47:01,505 --> 00:47:02,753
MATT: "Very well."

683
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:05,921
SAM: She's going to tell everyone.

684
00:47:05,921 --> 00:47:13,184
MATT: "That's going to help you. Anything else you
want to know? I've been living here most of my life."

685
00:47:13,184 --> 00:47:16,158
TRAVIS: Job postings. Anywhere we might go to--

686
00:47:16,158 --> 00:47:22,934
LAURA: Well, we have the King's Hall board, yo.
That's where the job postings are.

687
00:47:22,934 --> 00:47:30,041
MATT: "King's Hall is a good resource. If you're
really hit up hard and you want to try the route

688
00:47:30,041 --> 00:47:33,959
"that Bryce did, you can always sign up to become a
member of the military."

689
00:47:33,959 --> 00:47:35,013
TALIESIN: Eh.

690
00:47:35,013 --> 00:47:37,211
LAURA: Go fuck yourself! No!

691
00:47:37,211 --> 00:47:45,198
MATT: "It works well for some people. It pays, you
are trained. The Righteous Brand is very helpful

692
00:47:45,198 --> 00:47:49,689
"and helps keep the Empire safe from the terrors
that wander in and beyond the borders."

693
00:47:49,689 --> 00:47:55,567
TALIESIN: We're also always big fans of
underbellies, especially if there's an underbelly

694
00:47:55,567 --> 00:47:57,680
with a heart of gold.

695
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,192
LAURA: Especially one if it's furry and you can
pet it.

696
00:48:00,192 --> 00:48:06,465
MATT: "There are plenty of underbellies, but they
are localized, scattered, and very protective.

697
00:48:06,465 --> 00:48:09,891
"Keep your ears open, ask the right questions."

698
00:48:09,891 --> 00:48:13,815
TALIESIN: Are there names that, if we hear, we
should trust?

699
00:48:13,815 --> 00:48:18,393
MATT: "I don't trust anybody. That's how I'm still
alive and that's how I came to own this tavern."

700
00:48:18,393 --> 00:48:22,856
MARISHA: Great corner office, by the way. You have
a window!

701
00:48:22,856 --> 00:48:23,928
MATT: "Thank you."

702
00:48:23,928 --> 00:48:25,330
MARISHA: That's great.

703
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:33,988
MATT: "I had to change it a bit. The man I took it
all from, I wanted him to leave nothing behind."

704
00:48:33,988 --> 00:48:37,655
LAURA: Was he perchance named The Gentleman?

705
00:48:37,823 --> 00:48:43,393
MATT: There's a quick glance in your direction.
Her expression darkens and she goes, "No, but I

706
00:48:43,393 --> 00:48:45,484
"would be very careful how you use that name."

707
00:48:45,484 --> 00:48:46,850
LAURA: Oh, shit.

708
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:48,362
MARISHA: Really, now?

709
00:48:48,362 --> 00:48:50,257
LAURA: Do you know him?

710
00:48:50,257 --> 00:48:58,343
MATT: "I do not know him, but I know of him. That
thing I said about trying not to get in trouble

711
00:48:58,343 --> 00:49:05,081
"with the darker elements of the city that might be
in over your head? That is very specifically one

712
00:49:05,081 --> 00:49:07,040
"who wallows in that mire."

713
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,349
LAURA: Okay.

714
00:49:08,349 --> 00:49:14,862
MARISHA: He wallows in the underbelly shit? That's
what you said? That's me asking the DM.

715
00:49:14,862 --> 00:49:19,482
MATT: Yes, basically, wallows in the mire of the
underbelly shit. Sounds like a fun lyric.

716
00:49:19,482 --> 00:49:21,503
(singing) Wallows in the mire of the underbelly
shit!

717
00:49:21,503 --> 00:49:24,204
LAURA: That's the second verse.

718
00:49:24,204 --> 00:49:34,500
TRAVIS: Well, thank you for your time. I think
we'll find our way back down to the belly of this tavern.

719
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,213
MATT: "Very well. I will walk you down."

720
00:49:37,213 --> 00:49:40,129
LIAM: Sorry.

721
00:49:40,129 --> 00:49:41,042
MATT: "Yes."

722
00:49:41,042 --> 00:49:44,560
LIAM: I want to touch on something happening--
I'm not there. We're not there.

723
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,687
MATT: Oh, right.

724
00:49:45,687 --> 00:49:47,441
LIAM: So I want to touch on something that's
happening at the same time, but I will wait until

725
00:49:47,441 --> 00:49:48,876
you think it's a good moment.

726
00:49:48,876 --> 00:49:51,279
MATT: Sure. You can do it now while they're
exiting the office. While they've been in there--

727
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:57,248
LIAM: Yeah. Nott and Caleb didn't go up. They're
busy. Would you like to learn something interesting?

728
00:49:57,248 --> 00:49:58,929
SAM: A magic trick?

729
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:00,191
LIAM: Sort of.

730
00:50:00,191 --> 00:50:01,270
SAM: Yes!

731
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:08,492
LIAM: It's a little homework and a little bit
magic trick. This is where I keep my spells. This

732
00:50:08,492 --> 00:50:20,555
is my book. And this is the piece of luck that you
helped me achieve in Trostenwald. Over the months

733
00:50:20,555 --> 00:50:28,940
and years, I gather the amount of magic tricks that
I can do. So in this book, for instance, there is

734
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:37,538
a new spell that I do not even know how to use
myself where I can make an invisible helper. What

735
00:50:37,538 --> 00:50:43,055
is going to happen now, I bought supplies for it--
I find a booth for us in the corner-- is I am

736
00:50:43,055 --> 00:50:47,278
going to move it from here into here and I thought
you could help me. Would you like to do that?

737
00:50:47,278 --> 00:50:48,441
SAM: Yes!

738
00:50:48,441 --> 00:50:51,021
LIAM: Okay. So you can see--

739
00:50:51,021 --> 00:50:52,617
SAM: Photocopying!

740
00:50:52,617 --> 00:50:54,930
TRAVIS: Xerox!

741
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:59,885
LIAM: I don't know what that means, but this will
take a little while. Here, hold this. I hand a

742
00:50:59,885 --> 00:51:07,966
quill to her. Hold that. You can see the markings
on this page. It's intricate, but you can do the

743
00:51:07,966 --> 00:51:14,933
first few strokes. It needs to look like that, it
needs to go here. I guide her hand a little bit to

744
00:51:14,933 --> 00:51:19,238
make sure that it doesn't smudge too much. It's
still workable. Good. Now I will fill in the

745
00:51:19,238 --> 00:51:26,548
details. I spend the next-- they are probably gone
for 15 minutes-- putting down the glyphs and

746
00:51:26,548 --> 00:51:27,684
the markings.

747
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:28,900
SAM: It's delightful!

748
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:34,636
LIAM: And begin the first 30 minutes of the two
hours I need to spend copying this.

749
00:51:34,636 --> 00:51:40,573
SAM: Too much. I'll need to be plied with many
drinks.

750
00:51:40,573 --> 00:51:45,709
LIAM: Oh, yeah. Sliding them over.

751
00:51:45,709 --> 00:51:47,427
SAM: How's my penmanship?

752
00:51:47,427 --> 00:51:54,827
MATT: So far, so good. We'll see how it
progresses. As you guys exit the office, at the

753
00:51:54,827 --> 00:51:59,482
bottom of the stair, you can see that group that
was gathering earlier, with the young girl that was

754
00:51:59,482 --> 00:52:04,075
looking out towards the entryway, is there waiting
at the base of the stair.

755
00:52:04,075 --> 00:52:05,685
MARISHA: The bachelorette party?

756
00:52:05,685 --> 00:52:07,682
MATT: Yeah, the bachelorette party, if
you will.

757
00:52:07,739 --> 00:52:16,976
Though it was a mixed group. As soon as
you exit with Claudia, they notice her, notice

758
00:52:16,976 --> 00:52:23,366
you, and all step back for a moment and wait. As
you step down the stairs, a young half-elf girl,

759
00:52:23,366 --> 00:52:34,030
freckled, auburn hair, a smudged face of a hard
day's work, leans forward and goes, "Terribly

760
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:41,780
"sorry, Claudia. Are we good to use the cellar for
the meeting?" "Yes, of course. It is available to

761
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:46,283
"you right now. Not a problem." She goes, "All
right, thank you very much." She turns around and

762
00:52:46,283 --> 00:52:50,187
begins gathering up the crew. You can see a few
people at the bar, she's slowly gathering the folk

763
00:52:50,187 --> 00:52:54,575
until there's a cluster of about 20 or so. They
all begin making their way towards where the

764
00:52:54,575 --> 00:52:56,688
kitchen is into a pantry area.

765
00:52:56,688 --> 00:52:58,671
LAURA: Are they going to have an orgy?

766
00:52:58,671 --> 00:53:01,350
MATT: You're going to have to follow to find out.

767
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:02,968
LAURA: I'm asking that of Claudia.

768
00:53:02,968 --> 00:53:03,910
MATT: Oh.

769
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:05,564
SAM: Out loud.

770
00:53:05,564 --> 00:53:14,032
MATT: She goes, "No, not so much. They are
passionate political debaters."

771
00:53:14,032 --> 00:53:15,792
LAURA: Oh.

772
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:20,623
MARISHA: Are you helping run some underground
clubs?

773
00:53:20,623 --> 00:53:22,514
TRAVIS: Just right out in the open, huh?

774
00:53:22,514 --> 00:53:23,866
MARISHA: In your cellar?

775
00:53:23,866 --> 00:53:29,973
MATT: "No, I am merely providing a space for
people that are wanting to work through some

776
00:53:29,973 --> 00:53:33,134
"difficulties they have with their lifestyle. That
is all."

777
00:53:33,134 --> 00:53:35,273
LAURA: I'm running to find Caleb.

778
00:53:35,273 --> 00:53:41,551
LIAM: It's like latticework, you have to do the
smaller circle inside the larger.

779
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:43,491
SAM: You have to do this with every spell?

780
00:53:43,491 --> 00:53:45,016
LIAM: Each one's a little bit different.

781
00:53:45,016 --> 00:53:46,182
TALIESIN: (whispering) Caleb!

782
00:53:46,182 --> 00:53:47,780
SAM: We're busy here!

783
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:49,613
LIAM: We're really right in the middle of
something.

784
00:53:49,613 --> 00:53:51,283
TALIESIN: That's all right, we just need your
cat.

785
00:53:51,283 --> 00:53:53,853
MARISHA: I trail with Fjord! I want to know.

786
00:53:53,853 --> 00:53:56,378
TRAVIS: As we're heading down, I lean over to
Beau.

787
00:53:56,378 --> 00:53:58,166
LIAM: Frumpkin climbs up Molly's back.

788
00:53:58,166 --> 00:54:01,176
TALIESIN: I'm tossing Frumpkin in the direction of
that.

789
00:54:01,176 --> 00:54:03,713
LIAM: What are you doing with my cat?

790
00:54:03,713 --> 00:54:05,118
TALIESIN: In the basement!

791
00:54:05,118 --> 00:54:07,313
LAURA: Oh, you have to look through his eyes.

792
00:54:07,313 --> 00:54:08,981
SAM: You won't be able to see anything!

793
00:54:08,981 --> 00:54:11,115
TRAVIS: The two of us are going.

794
00:54:11,115 --> 00:54:15,361
LIAM: Go to the base-- look, the circle goes
inside the larger circle.

795
00:54:15,361 --> 00:54:18,211
SAM: What is the "a e" that's one letter?

796
00:54:18,211 --> 00:54:19,823
TRAVIS: I lean over to Beau and I say: I don't
know if you're aware of it, but when you

797
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:24,903
compliment people it sounds like a fucking insult.
Is that intentional?

798
00:54:24,903 --> 00:54:27,819
MARISHA: What?

799
00:54:27,819 --> 00:54:32,687
TRAVIS: It was just an observation. Like
commenting on the office window? You've gotta put

800
00:54:32,687 --> 00:54:33,796
more smile--

801
00:54:33,796 --> 00:54:37,808
MARISHA: Oh, but that was badass! She had a cool
fucking office, I guess.

802
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,421
TRAVIS: It didn't quite sound that way.

803
00:54:39,421 --> 00:54:40,401
MARISHA: Oh, no?

804
00:54:40,401 --> 00:54:42,641
TRAVIS: Yeah. Just something to put in your hat.

805
00:54:42,641 --> 00:54:44,518
LIAM: You know, maybe we pick this up later.

806
00:54:44,518 --> 00:54:45,647
MARISHA: Can I try it with you?

807
00:54:45,647 --> 00:54:46,612
TRAVIS: Yeah, go for it.

808
00:54:46,612 --> 00:54:49,275
SAM: I've just mastered the 'f' that looks like an
's'!

809
00:54:49,275 --> 00:54:51,063
MARISHA: You're really attractive.

810
00:54:51,063 --> 00:54:58,130
TRAVIS: Yeah, so let's start with maybe a little
smile on the face. That's always a good starting

811
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:00,221
point. Try again.

812
00:55:00,221 --> 00:55:02,151
MARISHA: You're really attractive.

813
00:55:02,151 --> 00:55:03,606
TRAVIS: Oh man, you look constipated.

814
00:55:03,606 --> 00:55:05,305
MARISHA: Is that worse somehow?

815
00:55:05,305 --> 00:55:07,850
TRAVIS: You ever winked at anybody?

816
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:12,237
MARISHA: You're really attractive.

817
00:55:12,237 --> 00:55:14,973
TRAVIS: We'll keep workshopping it.

818
00:55:14,973 --> 00:55:23,607
MARISHA: No? That still wasn't it? Fuck. Thank
you. At least thanks for telling me. Most people

819
00:55:23,607 --> 00:55:26,708
would just be like, "You're a bitch," and then
would leave.

820
00:55:26,708 --> 00:55:30,807
TRAVIS: I've been around you long enough that I
can tell you were actually trying to be nice.

821
00:55:30,807 --> 00:55:41,183
MARISHA: Thanks, man. I think you're real nice,
too. Genuine! I was being genuine!

822
00:55:41,183 --> 00:55:47,127
MATT: The two of you have wrapped up for the time
being.

823
00:55:47,127 --> 00:55:53,343
LAURA: I just wanted to borrow some parchment. Do
you have any extra pieces of paper, though?

824
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:55,887
LIAM: How much do you need? For what?

825
00:55:55,887 --> 00:55:58,016
LAURA: I don't know. Like 20 pieces.

826
00:55:58,016 --> 00:56:00,004
SAM: Do you need to write a long letter?

827
00:56:00,004 --> 00:56:01,436
LAURA: A really long one.

828
00:56:01,436 --> 00:56:02,912
LIAM: I'll give you two.

829
00:56:02,912 --> 00:56:05,525
LAURA: I can make do with that, yes. Thank you.

830
00:56:05,525 --> 00:56:06,978
LIAM: I hand them over.

831
00:56:06,978 --> 00:56:10,294
TALIESIN: I need to know what your cat's
seeing. What's the cat seeing?

832
00:56:10,294 --> 00:56:11,997
LIAM: Hold on.

833
00:56:11,997 --> 00:56:13,280
SAM: Okay. I've got you.

834
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,708
LAURA: I've got you, too.

835
00:56:14,708 --> 00:56:18,426
MATT: The cat, who's been following Fjord and
Beauregard, you guys have been having this

836
00:56:18,426 --> 00:56:23,999
conversation as you follow down to the cellar. As
you descend down the cellar stairs, you can hear

837
00:56:23,999 --> 00:56:31,769
conversation and a few voices passing. They all
get quiet. As you step and descend past where the

838
00:56:31,769 --> 00:56:38,225
ceiling of the basement reveals you, the group of
20 folks are all gathered around with a central

839
00:56:38,225 --> 00:56:48,292
podium on an elevated step or a box. They're all
looking at you, quiet. The one who's standing on

840
00:56:48,292 --> 00:56:57,627
the box is a human man probably in his early 60s
or so. Shorter hair, graying but a little unkempt

841
00:56:57,627 --> 00:57:04,937
in the face. He's got smaller spectacles at the
edge of his nose and unshaved stubble against his

842
00:57:04,937 --> 00:57:11,508
chin, but he's dressed in a nice, white shirt,
tucked in well, and looks thin and well-mannered.

843
00:57:11,508 --> 00:57:16,989
He puts his hand up and goes, "Hey there. Can we
help you?"

844
00:57:17,037 --> 00:57:20,799
LIAM: There's a bunch of people staring at Fjord
and Beauregard. Why are we doing this?

845
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:22,244
TALIESIN: Oh, for fuck's sake.

846
00:57:22,244 --> 00:57:26,613
TRAVIS: Apologies. We don't mean to intrude. We're
new to this city. We just heard that some higher

847
00:57:26,613 --> 00:57:31,338
thinkers were going to be meeting down here. We
hoped we might be able to join you.

848
00:57:31,338 --> 00:57:34,050
MARISHA: Just looking for good conversation.

849
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:35,951
TALIESIN: They're making asses of themselves,
aren't they?

850
00:57:35,951 --> 00:57:41,988
MATT: Everyone looks at each other. There's an
ornery dwarf fella who looks over to the guy in

851
00:57:41,988 --> 00:57:49,889
the top and shakes his head. The half-elven girl
who was gathering the group gives a nudge toward

852
00:57:49,889 --> 00:57:59,998
you with a smile and says, "We can at least ask."
He goes, "All right, well, step on up." The crowd

853
00:57:59,998 --> 00:58:15,320
separates a little bit as you guys approach. "I'm
curious. Share with me briefly the joys the Empire

854
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,976
"has brought to your life."

855
00:58:17,016 --> 00:58:19,272
LIAM: I think it's like Alcoholics Anonymous
or something.

856
00:58:19,272 --> 00:58:23,611
MATT: "Be honest."

857
00:58:23,655 --> 00:58:28,462
TRAVIS: I'm afraid my list is not that long,
unfortunately.

858
00:58:28,462 --> 00:58:41,820
MARISHA: We're a bit skeptical. We're looking for
support, just like any other wayward souls in this

859
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,442
crazy town.

860
00:58:43,442 --> 00:58:45,012
TRAVIS: We seek knowledge.

861
00:58:45,012 --> 00:58:53,958
MARISHA: We want to be able to trust our Empire,
but maybe we need some reassurance in one way or another.

862
00:58:53,958 --> 00:58:57,373
MATT: Make a persuasion check with advantage with
his help.

863
00:58:57,373 --> 00:59:09,873
MARISHA: Persuasion with advantage? That's good! I
got a natural 18 with a plus one, so 19. Just

864
00:59:09,873 --> 00:59:12,087
being real vague.

865
00:59:12,087 --> 00:59:22,899
MATT: "You seem to be on the level. We are a group
called the Knights of Requital, and we are

866
00:59:22,899 --> 00:59:35,676
"discussing methods of changing the current
political unhappiness in the city of Zadash and beyond."

867
00:59:35,676 --> 00:59:45,661
MARISHA: See, we're not the only ones. We felt
like something's been missing.

868
00:59:45,661 --> 00:59:50,313
TRAVIS: Tearing at our heart. It's an ache.

869
00:59:50,313 --> 00:59:55,313
MATT: "Very well. I will continue with my talk, if
you don't mind."

870
00:59:55,313 --> 00:59:56,790
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Please, yes.

871
00:59:56,790 --> 00:59:58,159
TRAVIS: Preach on.

872
00:59:58,159 --> 00:59:59,974
LIAM: Does that name mean anything to Caleb?

873
00:59:59,974 --> 01:00:07,785
MATT: No. Looking around the room, most of the
folks in here look to be salt-of-the-earth folk of

874
01:00:07,944 --> 01:00:14,904
the city. A few folks look to be a little more
wealthy, lower-to-middle class if you were to give

875
01:00:14,904 --> 01:00:24,765
any sort of comparison there, and they all look
like they're a bit riled up. The dwarf, who had

876
01:00:24,765 --> 01:00:32,700
eyed you up previously, his eyes have these heavy
bags under them, he's got this scraggly unkempt

877
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:39,713
brown beard, and very short, almost buzz-cut hair
on top. He's glaring at the two of you. He steps

878
01:00:39,713 --> 01:00:48,322
away from the crowd and keeps a very close eye.
The gentleman at the top, "First off, to our new

879
01:00:48,322 --> 01:01:00,562
"conversationalists, I am Dolan Thrym. As many of
you know her, I once ran a very successful physician

880
01:01:00,562 --> 01:01:13,671
"practice here in the Interstead Sprawl, one that
my partner was the head physician. Well, he was

881
01:01:13,671 --> 01:01:23,401
"unfortunately brought to an unearned level of
shame, and his practice ruined, as well as our

882
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:33,646
"industry, by the house of Sutan naught but a year ago.
We went from a comfortable living helping people

883
01:01:33,646 --> 01:01:45,353
"to a life of squalor and shame. I know we're not
the only one, as now the son of the house of

884
01:01:45,353 --> 01:01:51,674
"Sutan, Ren, sits at the top of that practice. Took
all of our clients and squeezes them for all of

885
01:01:51,674 --> 01:01:56,831
"their worth. And I, for one, am sick of it".
Everybody else in the group goes (grunt).

886
01:01:56,831 --> 01:01:58,256
MARISHA: (grunts)

887
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:09,112
MATT: "I'm sick of it and we can't sit back and
let nothing be done about it. Now, would you like

888
01:02:09,556 --> 01:02:14,098
"to take the floor, Ulog?" The dwarf who was
watching you guys takes his-- doesn't leave you

889
01:02:14,098 --> 01:02:20,327
for a moment before he steps over and the crowd
separates and he steps up onto the small block

890
01:02:20,327 --> 01:02:31,224
which at his height puts him about head level with
most of the crowd. "As many of you know, I was a

891
01:02:31,224 --> 01:02:39,498
woodworker for many years, carving wood, did good
carpentry. My wife, Illiana, is a good wife.

892
01:02:43,253 --> 01:02:50,677
About six months ago, she was up late at night
picking up food for the night for the two of

893
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:57,977
us in the Pentamarket. She was in the wrong place
at the wrong time. There were some street bandits

894
01:02:57,977 --> 01:03:07,087
outside the Tri-Spires. They stabbed someone who
had run in, ran clean into my wife, just as the

895
01:03:07,087 --> 01:03:17,939
Crownsguard descended. She got looped in with
them, thrown in jail. I went and fought. There

896
01:03:17,939 --> 01:03:23,724
wasn't even a bit of a trial. The High-Rictor sent
her straight to the Umber Dungeon, sentenced her

897
01:03:23,724 --> 01:03:35,987
20 years for this business. It's been six months
now, I can't even see her. I'm sick of it, and I

898
01:03:35,987 --> 01:03:38,442
think it's time we did something." Everyone in the
crowd goes (grunts).

899
01:03:40,222 --> 01:03:43,126
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (grunt)

900
01:03:43,134 --> 01:03:47,911
MATT: This continues one after another,
individuals start coming up and talking about

901
01:03:48,323 --> 01:03:55,388
resharing stories for the newcomers. Things that
have come up recently that frustrate them. They

902
01:03:55,388 --> 01:04:04,445
begin throwing things around like instability
within the Starosta's capable hands to maintain a

903
01:04:04,445 --> 01:04:09,434
political structure in a city this large. They
begin to talk on anger and frustration with the

904
01:04:09,434 --> 01:04:15,957
lack of proper education for the masses, keeping
them unable to climb status and eke out of living

905
01:04:15,957 --> 01:04:19,737
and thus are forced into the military to die out
on the fields of Xhorhas. There have been

906
01:04:19,737 --> 01:04:26,468
discussions about frustration dealing with the
ever creeping power scale of what's called the

907
01:04:26,468 --> 01:04:33,129
Cerberus Assembly and influence that stretches
from Rexxentrum into the city itself. Eventually,

908
01:04:33,129 --> 01:04:40,118
it begins to rise into many voices clamoring out
in frustration and once again, Dolan, the softer

909
01:04:40,118 --> 01:04:44,118
gentleman at the beginning puts his hands up and
steps back and goes: "I know, I know. I know.

910
01:04:50,218 --> 01:04:56,952
But we're going to find a way. I have friends that
I've made, people that we're talking to and we

911
01:04:57,768 --> 01:05:06,693
have, hopefully, a new beginning soon, an
opportunity where I think we can have a voice in

912
01:05:06,693 --> 01:05:17,879
the politics here. I hope to have more for you
soon, in the meantime, try and keep your chin up.

913
01:05:18,699 --> 01:05:25,855
I know it's hard now, but I believe we'll have an
opportunity soon. Thank you. Thank you to Kara,

914
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:30,486
who has been helping set these meetings up."
Points over to the younger half-elf earlier and she nods

915
01:05:30,486 --> 01:05:37,250
and a few hands clap. "And to our new members--
I'm sorry, I didn't get your names."

916
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:39,430
MARISHA: Beau.

917
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:40,104
TRAVIS: Fjord.

918
01:05:40,104 --> 01:05:44,574
MATT: "Beau and Fjord, thank you for joining us
tonight. It goes without saying, please, if you

919
01:05:44,574 --> 01:05:51,104
don't mind, we prefer to keep these conversations
personal. For obvious reasons."

920
01:05:51,807 --> 01:05:53,443
MARISHA: Absolutely.

921
01:05:53,443 --> 01:05:58,108
MATT: "If even the most misunderstood discontent
leads to unfortunate circumstances."

922
01:05:58,108 --> 01:06:00,726
TRAVIS: We understand. Thank you for sharing with
us.

923
01:06:00,726 --> 01:06:07,877
MARISHA: I know I, for one, have had my discontent
with the Empire, so it's good to hear we're not alone.

924
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:15,374
MATT: "Of course. That's requital. I appreciate
your time. Rest well, we'll meet soon. Dismissed!"

925
01:06:15,374 --> 01:06:18,780
Everyone begins to scatter and make their way back
up to the tavern.

926
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:21,172
TRAVIS: We stay down.

927
01:06:21,172 --> 01:06:24,235
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm going to wait behind. Wait to
talk to Dolan?

928
01:06:24,235 --> 01:06:29,780
TRAVIS: Yeah. Really appreciate what you said.

929
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:32,170
MARISHA: Yeah, thank you. So much.

930
01:06:32,170 --> 01:06:36,574
MATT: "Yeah, of course. I understand that you
aren't from around here, so don't feel that you

931
01:06:36,574 --> 01:06:46,993
have to take too much of this to heart. Best we
can do to try and keep spirits up. I believe that

932
01:06:46,993 --> 01:06:51,491
we can find a way to exact some change real
soon."

933
01:06:51,491 --> 01:06:57,730
TRAVIS: It struck a chord. It mirrors a lot of
what we've seen since we've been here. Do you meet

934
01:06:57,730 --> 01:06:59,798
very often? I'd love to come back.

935
01:07:00,658 --> 01:07:05,685
MATT: "Well, we're scheduled to meet here in the
next two days or so. We're gearing up for a couple

936
01:07:05,685 --> 01:07:06,977
of important events."

937
01:07:06,977 --> 01:07:13,355
MARISHA: How often are the meetings that heated?
That seemed pretty intense.

938
01:07:13,355 --> 01:07:14,500
TRAVIS: Yeah, personal. Emotional.

939
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:20,062
MATT: "It can vary. Anyway, I'm sorry. I really
should be going."

940
01:07:20,062 --> 01:07:22,950
MARISHA: Where abouts in town do you live?

941
01:07:22,950 --> 01:07:25,543
MATT: "Oh, I live outside of the Apple Tree
Tutors."

942
01:07:28,463 --> 01:07:32,092
MARISHA: We'll probably be staying here the next
few days.

943
01:07:34,482 --> 01:07:37,817
TRAVIS: Yeah. We'll check in with-- what was her
name?

944
01:07:37,817 --> 01:07:40,914
MARISHA: It's Claudia.

945
01:07:40,914 --> 01:07:45,011
TRAVIS: Yeah. We'll check in with Claudia if
there's any other meetings. Again, appreciate you

946
01:07:45,011 --> 01:07:46,563
being so open.

947
01:07:47,443 --> 01:07:56,602
MATT: "Appreciate you being respectful and close
to your chest. Anyway." He steps past the two of

948
01:07:56,602 --> 01:08:01,539
you, puts the rest of his jacket on, and exits.
Now it's just the two of you there in the cellar below.

949
01:08:01,539 --> 01:08:02,580
TRAVIS: What's in the cellar?

950
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:09,165
SAM: You going to rob the place there?

951
01:08:09,165 --> 01:08:12,269
TRAVIS: I just want to know. Is it munitions? Is
it meat? Is it booze?

952
01:08:12,269 --> 01:08:12,769
MARISHA: Wine? Is there good wine?

953
01:08:12,769 --> 01:08:21,821
MATT: There are large casks, large wooden barrels
and casks. This is where major ale storage is set,

954
01:08:21,821 --> 01:08:26,625
but none of them are tapped. It looks to be full
of crates that are still sealed; unopened.

955
01:08:26,625 --> 01:08:29,819
MARISHA: Any good wines? That I would recognize?

956
01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:31,446
MATT: None of the wines are kept in this cellar.

957
01:08:31,446 --> 01:08:32,581
MARISHA: Okay.

958
01:08:32,581 --> 01:08:36,810
MATT: By the size of the place, you get the sense
there's probably more than one storage place here.

959
01:08:36,810 --> 01:08:40,226
LIAM: When you scroll your cursor over it, though,
the descriptions are all in red.

960
01:08:40,226 --> 01:08:42,003
MARISHA: Sure. Can't access that.

961
01:08:42,003 --> 01:08:45,745
TRAVIS: Talk about an underbelly. That was more
than I was expecting.

962
01:08:45,745 --> 01:08:50,737
MARISHA: Yeah, and I totally called Claudia on it
too, and she didn't even come forward. I'm like,

963
01:08:50,737 --> 01:08:53,132
you're running some shit! She's running some
shit.

964
01:08:53,132 --> 01:08:53,876
TRAVIS: Right upfront.

965
01:08:53,876 --> 01:09:01,030
MARISHA: Did you notice he said thanks for keeping
things close to your chest? Are we that transparent?

966
01:09:01,038 --> 01:09:06,609
TRAVIS: No. I mean, I would say the same thing if
I was taking such a chance with people I didn't

967
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:10,103
know, right? I think he's just trying to invest in
us a little.

968
01:09:10,103 --> 01:09:10,744
MARISHA: Right.

969
01:09:10,744 --> 01:09:11,338
TRAVIS: Seemed nice.

970
01:09:11,338 --> 01:09:14,738
LIAM: I tell Frumpkin to yowl between their legs.

971
01:09:14,738 --> 01:09:15,728
MATT: (meowing)

972
01:09:15,728 --> 01:09:17,380
MARISHA: (yells)

973
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:19,503
TRAVIS: (suppressing a sneeze)

974
01:09:19,503 --> 01:09:22,493
MARISHA: I give Frumpkin the finger, hoping Caleb
will see.

975
01:09:22,493 --> 01:09:25,268
LIAM: I don't see it. I'm not looking through it.

976
01:09:25,268 --> 01:09:27,176
MARISHA: Now I'm just flicking off a cat.

977
01:09:27,176 --> 01:09:29,127
TALIESIN: You gave us the basics, though?

978
01:09:29,127 --> 01:09:29,627
LIAM: Yeah.

979
01:09:29,627 --> 01:09:31,922
TRAVIS: Let's go back up. Fuck it.

980
01:09:31,922 --> 01:09:37,377
LAURA: I was spending my time cutting the
parchment up into even, little rectangles so I

981
01:09:37,377 --> 01:09:40,277
could make them into multiple pieces of paper.

982
01:09:40,287 --> 01:09:42,325
MATT: Easy enough to do.

983
01:09:43,405 --> 01:09:44,613
MARISHA: We go back.

984
01:09:45,513 --> 01:09:48,913
MATT: As you guys head up into the tavern to meet
up with the rest of your troop, you see they're all

985
01:09:48,913 --> 01:09:51,577
sitting around, handling their other business.
What are you guys up to?

986
01:09:52,647 --> 01:09:56,670
TALIESIN: We were listening to the description of
this insanity.

987
01:09:56,670 --> 01:10:00,876
LIAM: I bamfed out of that probably two minutes
before it finished, so I didn't get the tail end,

988
01:10:00,876 --> 01:10:02,577
but I got the meat.

989
01:10:02,577 --> 01:10:05,508
MATT: You got the meat of it. You watched the
people that were in the meeting leave in small

990
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:08,258
groups. They're pacing their exits.

991
01:10:08,258 --> 01:10:11,448
TRAVIS: Jester, don't believe what you hear. It
was a huge orgy. Just naked parts everywhere.

992
01:10:11,448 --> 01:10:15,228
LAURA: I figured it was and Caleb was lying to us
the whole time.

993
01:10:15,228 --> 01:10:21,224
TRAVIS: I know. Maple syrup. They had little Tic
Tacs and all sorts of chocolate chips. Lollipops galore.

994
01:10:21,224 --> 01:10:27,665
LAURA: Usually, in orgies like that, they don't
let you stay unless (tongue clicking). You're part of it.

995
01:10:27,665 --> 01:10:30,199
LIAM: He's not sticky with maple syrup. He's
lying.

996
01:10:31,479 --> 01:10:32,501
TRAVIS: Tongue bath.

997
01:10:33,341 --> 01:10:35,221
LAURA: Eww. Nice.

998
01:10:38,491 --> 01:10:43,829
SAM: I think what we should do is take the names
and descriptions of all of those people and turn

999
01:10:43,829 --> 01:10:50,998
them in to the authorities for 50 gold a person.
We could make so much money and be heroes in this

1000
01:10:50,998 --> 01:10:53,843
town as well! Just like we were in the last!

1001
01:10:54,451 --> 01:10:59,478
LIAM: Maybe not that, but quite frankly, those
people are reckless, telling you what they told you.

1002
01:10:59,478 --> 01:11:03,192
TRAVIS: Yeah, it is. The only problem with that
would be we were in that meeting at well.

1003
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:04,276
SAM: As spies!

1004
01:11:04,676 --> 01:11:08,776
TALIESIN: Except that they told them their real
names. And where they're staying.

1005
01:11:09,276 --> 01:11:15,003
LIAM: The authorities don't delineate between the
real McCoy and the passersby. Just like that man's

1006
01:11:15,003 --> 01:11:16,257
story. The dwarf.

1007
01:11:16,257 --> 01:11:20,593
TALIESIN: Groups of people are always idiots.
Never trust a group of people. I specifically used

1008
01:11:21,257 --> 01:11:24,300
to gather people into groups to make them into
idiots. It's just what you do. You don't--

1009
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:25,719
LAURA: So you did that to us!

1010
01:11:25,719 --> 01:11:28,668
TALIESIN: That is exactly what I did! It's how I
met you. It's why I keep you around.

1011
01:11:28,668 --> 01:11:30,596
MARISHA: You also traveled with a group of
people.

1012
01:11:32,226 --> 01:11:34,798
TALIESIN: Yes, but we weren't a group of people.
We all hated each other.

1013
01:11:34,798 --> 01:11:35,974
TRAVIS: It's a smaller group.

1014
01:11:35,974 --> 01:11:37,805
LAURA: It's a pretty big group. There's nine of
us.

1015
01:11:37,805 --> 01:11:39,380
MARISHA: Do you notice how often his logic falls
apart?

1016
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:42,265
TALIESIN: You just told them your real name!

1017
01:11:42,755 --> 01:11:45,030
MARISHA: No. I told them I'm Beau.

1018
01:11:46,752 --> 01:11:52,237
SAM: You left out the -regard part! And you
mispronounced your name "Ford" when we all know

1019
01:11:52,237 --> 01:11:53,492
it's Fjord!

1020
01:11:53,492 --> 01:11:54,357
TRAVIS: That's right. Yeah.

1021
01:11:55,217 --> 01:11:56,054
SAM: Clever!

1022
01:11:56,054 --> 01:11:59,198
MARISHA: Yeah. there's a lot of people named Beau.
Right?

1023
01:11:59,198 --> 01:12:03,622
LAURA: Are there? I've only met one other person named
Beau.

1024
01:12:04,385 --> 01:12:05,401
TALIESIN: I've literally only met one other person
named Beau.

1025
01:12:05,401 --> 01:12:08,672
TRAVIS: It's a good nickname. Beau. Beauregard.

1026
01:12:08,672 --> 01:12:11,360
LAURA: I think his name was not the same Beau as
your Beau.

1027
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,399
TALIESIN: It was a different Beau.

1028
01:12:12,399 --> 01:12:17,522
LAURA: It was a different Beau. I'm going to start
folding my little pieces of paper into little trifolds.

1029
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:21,188
MATT: All righty. What else are you guys doing?

1030
01:12:23,208 --> 01:12:24,973
TRAVIS: I think we're probably good to retire.

1031
01:12:25,473 --> 01:12:29,122
LIAM: I'm going to turn in. I have a little bit
more homework to do before the end of the night.

1032
01:12:29,122 --> 01:12:30,267
Good night. Thank you. Good night.

1033
01:12:30,267 --> 01:12:34,745
TALIESIN: I'm eventually falling asleep, but
before that, I'm going to go take a fucking bath.

1034
01:12:34,745 --> 01:12:40,722
There is a bathhouse. I'm going there. Anyone who
wants to come with me is welcome to do so.

1035
01:12:40,722 --> 01:12:43,626
LAURA: Aww, I want a bath so bad, but it's so
late, Molly!

1036
01:12:43,626 --> 01:12:44,698
TALIESIN: It's just a walk!

1037
01:12:44,698 --> 01:12:47,198
LAURA: Is it even going to be open at night?

1038
01:12:47,198 --> 01:12:48,766
TALIESIN: Is it going to be open at night?

1039
01:12:48,766 --> 01:12:50,311
MATT: You can go and try and find out.

1040
01:12:50,311 --> 01:12:52,441
TALIESIN: I'm going to go and try and find out. 
I'm going to and try and find out!

1041
01:12:52,441 --> 01:12:55,476
LAURA: Okay. I have important work to do.

1042
01:12:55,476 --> 01:12:57,467
SAM: I'll accompany you, just to make sure you
don't get killed.

1043
01:12:57,980 --> 01:13:00,698
LAURA: I'll come with you too because I really
want a bath.

1044
01:13:00,698 --> 01:13:06,671
MARISHA: I guess I stay behind with Fjord. We talk
about the crazy shit we just heard.

1045
01:13:06,671 --> 01:13:08,128
TRAVIS: Yeah, because we're fucking spies!

1046
01:13:08,128 --> 01:13:12,523
MARISHA: Fuck yeah, man! We'll break the system!
Put it in the ground!

1047
01:13:12,523 --> 01:13:13,850
LAURA: It's folded like this.

1048
01:13:13,850 --> 01:13:16,484
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Fuck the man!

1049
01:13:16,484 --> 01:13:17,388
MATT: All righty.

1050
01:13:17,388 --> 01:13:19,676
TALIESIN: I'm just happy with my company.

1051
01:13:19,676 --> 01:13:21,798
MATT: Right. Now, the two of you make an
investigation check.

1052
01:13:21,798 --> 01:13:22,764
TALIESIN: Three.

1053
01:13:22,764 --> 01:13:24,105
MATT: That's right. She's coming as well.

1054
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,606
LAURA: Oh, that's really bad. It's because I'm
folding paper.

1055
01:13:28,606 --> 01:13:31,556
SAM: 17. I'm specifically looking for stores.

1056
01:13:31,556 --> 01:13:32,814
TALIESIN: 15.

1057
01:13:32,814 --> 01:13:33,704
LAURA: Four!

1058
01:13:37,147 --> 01:13:43,572
MATT: You do manage to discover the location of
The Steam's Respite, but it is closed for the

1059
01:13:43,572 --> 01:13:46,053
night. It is too late for its functionality.

1060
01:13:46,053 --> 01:13:46,910
LAURA: Damn it!

1061
01:13:46,910 --> 01:13:54,223
SAM: On the way, do we pass Packwearer's
Provisions or any of the other fine establishments

1062
01:13:54,223 --> 01:13:55,514
you've told us about?

1063
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:59,570
MATT: If you wander through the Pentamarket, which
you can go roundabout to do that.

1064
01:13:59,570 --> 01:14:01,000
TALIESIN: That's not on the way, then.

1065
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:01,780
SAM: No. Just on the way.

1066
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:08,289
MATT: On the way from where you are exiting there,
none of those, no. The Pentamarket is pretty much

1067
01:14:08,289 --> 01:14:09,818
this cluster at the center of--

1068
01:14:09,818 --> 01:14:12,008
SAM: Any shops at all, or is it just--?

1069
01:14:12,008 --> 01:14:22,962
MATT: You would've come across more small food
establishments like small dumpling establishments.

1070
01:14:22,962 --> 01:14:28,849
Nothing too crazy. It looks like most of the
stores that are on the outskirts would be simple

1071
01:14:28,849 --> 01:14:39,678
glassware, the occasional basic blacksmiths for
putting horseshoes on and the construction of

1072
01:14:39,678 --> 01:14:42,963
that, simple armor repairs for whoever needs it.

1073
01:14:43,223 --> 01:14:44,332
SAM: Nothing fun.

1074
01:14:44,332 --> 01:14:48,469
MATT: Nothing crazy. Most of the good stuff is in
the vicinity you've already been.

1075
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:54,606
TALIESIN: You know, Nott, I notice. I notice the
way that you eye things, on occasion.

1076
01:14:55,736 --> 01:14:58,312
SAM: I'm not stealing anything right now!

1077
01:14:58,312 --> 01:15:03,858
TALIESIN: Not right now and that's fine. And I
would hate to get in the way of any of your

1078
01:15:03,858 --> 01:15:09,629
business. Your business is your business and I'm
perfectly fine with that. But it's good to

1079
01:15:09,629 --> 01:15:14,971
remember that there are people who need what they
have. There are people who need every bit of what

1080
01:15:14,971 --> 01:15:19,058
they have. And there are people who would be much
happier if they had a little less.

1081
01:15:19,738 --> 01:15:21,404
SAM: How do I know which is which?

1082
01:15:21,404 --> 01:15:27,745
TALIESIN: Well that's a skill worth developing.
That's a skill very much worth developing.

1083
01:15:27,745 --> 01:15:31,744
LAURA: If the people look like you and Caleb, they
probably need it.

1084
01:15:32,744 --> 01:15:40,401
TALIESIN: If they seem grumpy, or angry, and seem
overly concerned with an enormous amount of money

1085
01:15:40,401 --> 01:15:45,556
that they happen to have, or using it to just be
mean or cruel to somebody, that's probably a sign

1086
01:15:45,556 --> 01:15:49,908
that they'd just be much happier if they just knew
exactly who liked them and the only way you could

1087
01:15:49,908 --> 01:15:54,660
ever really know if someone likes you is if you
don't have anything over them. And the easiest way

1088
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:57,061
to get to that honesty is if you don't have
anything.

1089
01:15:57,711 --> 01:16:00,016
SAM: So you're saying steal from grumpy people?

1090
01:16:00,016 --> 01:16:00,715
TALIESIN: Oh yes.

1091
01:16:00,715 --> 01:16:02,305
LAURA: Shitty people specifically.

1092
01:16:02,305 --> 01:16:05,664
TALIESIN: Unless they're grumpy because they don't
have enough. Because if you're hungry, you get

1093
01:16:05,664 --> 01:16:06,288
very angry.

1094
01:16:06,288 --> 01:16:07,646
LAURA: I do, I do get really mad.

1095
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:09,237
TALIESIN: You get so angry when you're hungry!

1096
01:16:09,237 --> 01:16:09,802
LAURA: I know.

1097
01:16:10,492 --> 01:16:12,414
SAM: Which kind of grumpy is Beau?

1098
01:16:13,704 --> 01:16:18,346
TALIESIN: Beau has way too much. So you should
probably take some stuff from Beau. That's fair.

1099
01:16:18,346 --> 01:16:21,346
(laughter)

1100
01:16:22,446 --> 01:16:25,820
Beau really needs to know who likes her.

1101
01:16:26,490 --> 01:16:28,284
TRAVIS: Beau knows grumpy.

1102
01:16:28,284 --> 01:16:31,225
(laughter)

1103
01:16:31,225 --> 01:16:35,584
LAURA: Oh no! It makes sense when you're in that
shirt.

1104
01:16:36,734 --> 01:16:38,758
MATT: It makes sense when you're over 30.

1105
01:16:38,758 --> 01:16:42,357
(laughter)

1106
01:16:43,727 --> 01:16:45,326
TRAVIS: Passive sports marketing campaign: check!

1107
01:16:48,516 --> 01:16:52,993
MATT: All right. So you guys find your way back.
What about the rest of you guys, anything?

1108
01:16:52,993 --> 01:16:57,271
LIAM: I am just finishing up the spell Unseen
Servant before I go to bed so that I will know it

1109
01:16:57,271 --> 01:16:58,312
in the morning.

1110
01:16:58,312 --> 01:16:59,532
MATT: Easily enough. You have it copied over
without issue.

1111
01:16:59,532 --> 01:17:00,757
LIAM: Yes. Yes!

1112
01:17:00,757 --> 01:17:02,003
TALIESIN: I'm so excited about a long rest.

1113
01:17:02,003 --> 01:17:08,511
LAURA: Before I go to sleep, I'm going to use my
little folded papers and make little pamphlets to

1114
01:17:08,511 --> 01:17:13,699
the Traveler. So it's going to be like, "Have you
heard of our lord and savior, the Traveler?"

1115
01:17:13,699 --> 01:17:16,504
TALIESIN: You're going to get us killed!

1116
01:17:17,114 --> 01:17:22,238
LAURA: He sure is the coolest, everyone should
worship him, he's the best guy around.

1117
01:17:22,238 --> 01:17:30,323
TALIESIN: You're making Tijuana bibles. You're
making Tijuana bibles for your religion. Is there

1118
01:17:30,968 --> 01:17:34,888
going to be nudity and sex in these? Because then
it's basically a Tijuana bible. Don't Google

1119
01:17:34,888 --> 01:17:35,916
Tijuana bible.

1120
01:17:35,916 --> 01:17:41,929
LAURA: They're like this little, because I had to
make them out of only two sheets of--

1121
01:17:41,929 --> 01:17:42,815
MATT: How many did you make?

1122
01:17:42,815 --> 01:17:47,869
LAURA: Well, however many I could make out of two
sheets of parchment, so probably like eight or

1123
01:17:47,869 --> 01:17:49,718
maybe ten.

1124
01:17:49,718 --> 01:17:54,916
MATT: We'll say ten and a few that didn't quite--
you got halfway through and like (frustrated

1125
01:17:54,916 --> 01:17:59,814
noise) tore it up. Okay cool. So the rest of you
guys, are you all resting for the evening?

1126
01:17:59,814 --> 01:18:00,553
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

1127
01:18:00,553 --> 01:18:06,518
MATT: All right. Night rest comes without issue.
You awake in the morning to the sound of an

1128
01:18:06,518 --> 01:18:14,207
already muttering tavern floor below you. The
smell of food and whatever dried ale has been

1129
01:18:14,207 --> 01:18:18,524
spilled into the room that you're currently
sleeping in. But the day is yours, the morning has

1130
01:18:18,524 --> 01:18:20,420
arrived, you are welcome to do what you wish.

1131
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:25,699
TRAVIS: Molly, do you need to pray over your
swords? I don't know how often--

1132
01:18:26,315 --> 01:18:27,557
TALIESIN: Oh, I did it before you woke up.

1133
01:18:27,557 --> 01:18:31,959
TRAVIS: Oh. Well next time, could you include me
in it? I don't know if maybe it would help me with

1134
01:18:31,959 --> 01:18:32,810
my skills.

1135
01:18:32,810 --> 01:18:35,144
TALIESIN: Sure. Happily.

1136
01:18:35,144 --> 01:18:36,025
TRAVIS: I appreciate that.

1137
01:18:36,025 --> 01:18:37,534
TALIESIN: That would be no problem.

1138
01:18:37,534 --> 01:18:38,710
MARISHA: Morning, Jester.

1139
01:18:38,710 --> 01:18:41,113
LAURA: Beau! You know what we need to do today?

1140
01:18:41,113 --> 01:18:41,701
MARISHA: What?

1141
01:18:41,701 --> 01:18:46,915
LAURA: We need to go to the pillow place and go
get some money from my mom!

1142
01:18:46,915 --> 01:18:49,328
MARISHA: Your-- okay, yeah.

1143
01:18:49,328 --> 01:18:50,895
LIAM: How do you get money from your mom?

1144
01:18:50,895 --> 01:18:52,508
LAURA: You're not with us in our room right now!

1145
01:18:52,508 --> 01:18:54,084
LIAM: Oh, you didn't come downstairs? Okay.

1146
01:18:54,084 --> 01:18:54,914
MARISHA: Are you--

1147
01:18:54,914 --> 01:18:56,031
TRAVIS: Peeping tom!

1148
01:18:56,031 --> 01:18:58,383
LAURA: How does he do that?

1149
01:18:58,383 --> 01:19:01,291
MARISHA: How do you know? How do you know that
it's going to be there?

1150
01:19:01,291 --> 01:19:03,314
LAURA: Because I asked her for it.

1151
01:19:03,314 --> 01:19:08,512
MARISHA: Okay, but asking isn't the same as
confirmation of receiving.

1152
01:19:08,512 --> 01:19:13,594
LAURA: Yes, but it's my mom and of course she's
going to send me money! You're crazy.

1153
01:19:13,594 --> 01:19:17,387
MARISHA: Yeah. Totally. Let's go. I'll go with
you.

1154
01:19:17,387 --> 01:19:23,658
LAURA: It's called the Pillow Trove. We need to go
there. But we need to look very pretty, so before

1155
01:19:23,658 --> 01:19:26,313
that, I'm going to see if Molly wants to go get a
bath.

1156
01:19:26,313 --> 01:19:29,692
MARISHA: Okay. We have to look pretty?

1157
01:19:29,692 --> 01:19:32,539
LAURA: Yes, we have to be fancy for that place.

1158
01:19:32,539 --> 01:19:36,992
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah.

1159
01:19:36,992 --> 01:19:42,020
LAURA: We also need to go to the blacksmith, you
guys! As I'm coming down the stairs. We have so

1160
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:43,079
many things to sell.

1161
01:19:43,079 --> 01:19:43,680
MARISHA: We do.

1162
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:45,326
TALIESIN: Blacksmith's is filthy; we'll go there
first.

1163
01:19:45,326 --> 01:19:46,919
LAURA: Good call.

1164
01:19:46,919 --> 01:19:48,703
SAM: All right.

1165
01:19:48,703 --> 01:19:50,489
MARISHA: We stumble downstairs.

1166
01:19:50,489 --> 01:19:58,382
MATT: You get your food, your breakfast set. Let's
see here. We'll say for the two meals and the

1167
01:19:58,382 --> 01:20:04,909
drinks, and the three rooms overnight. If you want
to keep track of the tab. Though you haven't paid

1168
01:20:04,909 --> 01:20:07,173
it yet, necessarily, if you're staying for a
while.

1169
01:20:07,173 --> 01:20:08,214
MARISHA: Under the Nein?

1170
01:20:08,214 --> 01:20:14,749
MATT: Put you at--

1171
01:20:14,749 --> 01:20:16,630
LAURA: Plus, we're good friends of Claudia's!

1172
01:20:16,630 --> 01:20:18,580
TRAVIS: He's the DM.

1173
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:26,145
MATT: I'll put you at, at the three rooms, food
and drink, at about six gold so far.

1174
01:20:26,145 --> 01:20:28,067
TRAVIS: Okay, gotcha. Six gold.

1175
01:20:28,067 --> 01:20:29,904
MATT: This isn't the nicer part of town.

1176
01:20:29,904 --> 01:20:34,260
TRAVIS: So far. One gold each.

1177
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:35,651
MATT: All right. So.

1178
01:20:35,651 --> 01:20:39,554
LIAM: Is Claudia down in this room at the moment?

1179
01:20:39,554 --> 01:20:47,414
MATT: At the moment, no. Looks like it is your
dragonborn friend and there's maybe six people in

1180
01:20:47,414 --> 01:20:48,153
the room.

1181
01:20:48,153 --> 01:20:50,465
TRAVIS: How did your homework go last night?

1182
01:20:50,465 --> 01:20:54,304
LIAM: Very well. I am a step ahead of where I was
yesterday.

1183
01:20:54,304 --> 01:20:56,239
TRAVIS: Hey, that's great! Nicely done.

1184
01:20:56,239 --> 01:21:02,793
LIAM: (lip smacking) I walk over to this
dragonborn. Good morning to you.

1185
01:21:02,793 --> 01:21:03,918
MATT: "Right, good morning."

1186
01:21:03,918 --> 01:21:06,790
LIAM: Sorry, I know you are busy preparing for the
day.

1187
01:21:06,790 --> 01:21:07,864
MATT: "That's all right."

1188
01:21:07,864 --> 01:21:13,276
LIAM: I hear there is a rather large library here
in this city. This is correct, ja?

1189
01:21:13,276 --> 01:21:20,035
MATT: "There's probably a few places with
libraries. There's the Archive--"

1190
01:21:20,035 --> 01:21:22,735
LIAM: That's the biggest one. The main one.

1191
01:21:22,735 --> 01:21:26,631
MATT: "Yeah. There's also the Hall of Erudition.
I'm pretty sure they got libraries as well."

1192
01:21:26,631 --> 01:21:28,154
LIAM: The Hall of Erudition?

1193
01:21:28,154 --> 01:21:33,943
MATT: "Yeah, it's where the Soltryce
Academy's...academy...is here."

1194
01:21:33,943 --> 01:21:42,740
LIAM: Oh good. Okay. The first place, though,
could you point me in the direction of it from here?

1195
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:56,328
MATT: "Right, that would be, let's see, right
around-- Hmm." (singsong) Let me make sure I get

1196
01:21:56,328 --> 01:22:07,135
this correct for internal consistency. Ah, that
would be in the Interstead Sprawl. If you consider

1197
01:22:07,135 --> 01:22:13,727
the city's triangular shape, there's the pentagram
market off-center and a little bit to the west of

1198
01:22:13,727 --> 01:22:18,703
it, and then there's the East and West
Outersteads, which are the outside cusp and the

1199
01:22:18,703 --> 01:22:23,005
slums and the outside of the main wall; there's
the Tri-Spire, which is up north; then there's a

1200
01:22:23,005 --> 01:22:28,684
section, a quadrant over here, it's a military
section in this weird ring that surrounds and

1201
01:22:28,684 --> 01:22:31,741
bisects them all around the Pentamarket. That's
the Interstead Sprawl.

1202
01:22:31,741 --> 01:22:32,947
TRAVIS: That's the garrison area?

1203
01:22:32,947 --> 01:22:38,196
MATT: Yeah. Well, no, that's the more
middle-class, central connecting part that holds

1204
01:22:38,196 --> 01:22:39,788
the rest of the city together.

1205
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:41,299
TRAVIS: Gotcha. Garrison's more east, you said.

1206
01:22:41,299 --> 01:22:42,145
LIAM: Library is there?

1207
01:22:42,145 --> 01:22:43,306
MATT: The library is there.

1208
01:22:43,306 --> 01:22:44,688
LIAM: And it's to the east, you were saying?

1209
01:22:44,688 --> 01:22:49,028
MATT: From where you are now, you guys are in the
Eastern Outersteads, it would be west. And he

1210
01:22:49,028 --> 01:22:55,794
goes, "Actually (ugh), hold on just a second, I'll
get to your meal. Follow me." He comes out from

1211
01:22:55,794 --> 01:23:01,071
behind the bar and slaps it up, and puts an arm
around your shoulder and leads you right

1212
01:23:01,071 --> 01:23:04,168
immediately outside to the front of the tavern,
pushing you along.

1213
01:23:04,168 --> 01:23:05,457
LIAM: Ja, okay, I shrink inward.

1214
01:23:06,487 --> 01:23:14,429
MATT: He goes, "You look over that rooftop there,
and you can see that-- " and you see this slowly

1215
01:23:14,429 --> 01:23:26,715
tapering tower that then curves off at the very
top to be a very dome-like pinnacle. The stonework

1216
01:23:26,715 --> 01:23:32,712
itself appears to be like a smooth concrete
looking texture just from this distance, and the

1217
01:23:32,712 --> 01:23:39,991
way the morning sun is hitting it, half of it is
just bright and reflective and really intricate

1218
01:23:39,991 --> 01:23:45,509
carving and various tiers along the towers. He
goes, "That there's the Archive. That's what

1219
01:23:45,509 --> 01:23:47,990
you're looking for. So just look at that tower and
keep going."

1220
01:23:47,990 --> 01:23:48,859
LIAM: Thank you.

1221
01:23:48,859 --> 01:23:49,773
MATT: "No worries."

1222
01:23:49,773 --> 01:23:57,624
LIAM: Also, asking the DM, not this dragonborn,
but you had mentioned the Chastity's Nook. Caleb

1223
01:23:57,624 --> 01:23:59,425
would remember if you said what area it's in?

1224
01:23:59,425 --> 01:24:00,073
MATT: Tri-Spires.

1225
01:24:00,073 --> 01:24:01,428
LIAM: Tri-Spires. Thank you. Got it.

1226
01:24:01,428 --> 01:24:04,091
MARISHA: Get that smut, boy, get that smut.

1227
01:24:04,091 --> 01:24:04,912
LIAM: Sure, sure.

1228
01:24:05,472 --> 01:24:06,871
TRAVIS: Did you say, "Get that smut?"

1229
01:24:06,871 --> 01:24:07,735
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

1230
01:24:07,735 --> 01:24:08,804
LIAM: Was there any question?

1231
01:24:08,804 --> 01:24:09,634
TRAVIS: Just making sure.

1232
01:24:09,634 --> 01:24:14,137
LIAM: Okay. All right. Thank you very much. You're
very helpful.

1233
01:24:14,137 --> 01:24:18,401
MATT: "No worries." He runs back and quickly gets
beneath-- there are now two people waiting for him

1234
01:24:18,401 --> 01:24:21,959
to get back, and he gets back to pouring drinks
and getting food orders situated.

1235
01:24:21,959 --> 01:24:24,784
TRAVIS: So we're going to the blacksmith. Then
we're getting Molly a bath.

1236
01:24:24,784 --> 01:24:26,636
LAURA: And me and me and me.

1237
01:24:26,636 --> 01:24:30,610
TRAVIS: And you. And then are we looking for job
postings? Like, maybe some work?

1238
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:33,989
TALIESIN: You're welcome to take a look at the job
postings if you don't want to take a bath, but I'd

1239
01:24:33,989 --> 01:24:35,778
highly recommend a bath. Baths are great.

1240
01:24:36,478 --> 01:24:37,600
LAURA: They really are.

1241
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:40,537
TRAVIS: Is it like a fancy thing?

1242
01:24:40,537 --> 01:24:42,303
TALIESIN: Yes. Very fancy.

1243
01:24:43,453 --> 01:24:44,601
TRAVIS: Is it expensive?

1244
01:24:45,721 --> 01:24:47,713
TALIESIN: That entirely depends what you think
it's worth.

1245
01:24:47,713 --> 01:24:49,034
TRAVIS: Are you doing this?

1246
01:24:51,724 --> 01:24:53,856
MARISHA: Blacksmith first and we'll see, how about
that?

1247
01:24:53,856 --> 01:24:54,537
TRAVIS: Yeah, fair enough.

1248
01:24:54,537 --> 01:24:57,066
LAURA: Because we might make so much money from
the blacksmith.

1249
01:24:57,066 --> 01:24:58,849
TRAVIS: That is true.

1250
01:24:58,849 --> 01:25:01,246
LIAM: Nott! What do you want to do today?

1251
01:25:01,246 --> 01:25:06,908
SAM: I want to steal something. I have the itch.
It's back.

1252
01:25:06,908 --> 01:25:08,055
TRAVIS: The syphilis itch?

1253
01:25:08,055 --> 01:25:09,247
LIAM: All right.

1254
01:25:09,247 --> 01:25:11,612
SAM: Extreme syphilis!

1255
01:25:12,492 --> 01:25:17,504
MARISHA: We met an ex-physician. Just...never
mind. Never mind.

1256
01:25:17,504 --> 01:25:20,096
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, he could check you out. Give
your crotch the old once over.

1257
01:25:20,096 --> 01:25:21,942
SAM: A former doctor?! Sign me up!

1258
01:25:21,942 --> 01:25:25,271
(laughter)

1259
01:25:26,701 --> 01:25:27,546
TALIESIN: Wow.

1260
01:25:28,756 --> 01:25:35,542
LIAM: You know, I'm sure we can facilitate that.
Let's maybe manage our expectations, not go for

1261
01:25:35,542 --> 01:25:38,542
the plumpest plum on the bush.

1262
01:25:38,542 --> 01:25:41,534
SAM: Don't worry, I'm only going for grumpy people
today.

1263
01:25:41,534 --> 01:25:42,130
LIAM: Okay.

1264
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:43,865
TRAVIS: Amazing!

1265
01:25:44,245 --> 01:25:45,668
TALIESIN: I'm so excited!

1266
01:25:46,498 --> 01:25:48,057
LIAM: This was an idea you had?

1267
01:25:48,057 --> 01:25:52,306
SAM: It was given to me by a wise weirdo.

1268
01:25:54,236 --> 01:25:57,320
LIAM: Right. I'm not going to question it.

1269
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:59,550
TALIESIN: It's not the first time I've been
called-- actually, no, it's not the first time

1270
01:25:59,550 --> 01:26:02,273
I've been called that, that's fair. It's not
Molly, this is me.

1271
01:26:02,744 --> 01:26:04,631
LIAM: Okay, thank you, okay.

1272
01:26:04,631 --> 01:26:09,493
MATT: As you guys are making your way through the
East Outersteads towards the Pentamarket, you said

1273
01:26:09,493 --> 01:26:10,653
you're going to the blacksmith?

1274
01:26:10,653 --> 01:26:16,600
MARISHA: Yeah. To... the... Spark Hammer
Smithing!

1275
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:20,197
(laughter)

1276
01:26:20,197 --> 01:26:23,252
MARISHA: That worked real well!

1277
01:26:23,252 --> 01:26:23,995
MATT: Yeah, it did.

1278
01:26:23,995 --> 01:26:27,934
LIAM: She is the grumpy one! Pencil in the DM's
neck!

1279
01:26:27,934 --> 01:26:33,492
MATT: As you're making your way there, one thing
that you do-- you hear a voice that's loudly

1280
01:26:33,492 --> 01:26:38,174
talking that crosses you guys as you're walking
down the street. You can see a younger man in his

1281
01:26:38,174 --> 01:26:46,185
early 20s or so; he has really thin, blondish
hair, and he's wearing a tabard that is the same

1282
01:26:46,185 --> 01:26:50,037
colors as the Crownsguard, but other than that,
normal clothing.

1283
01:26:50,037 --> 01:26:50,706
LAURA: What's a tabard?

1284
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:54,559
MATT: A tabard is a piece of cloth that goes over
the front and back--

1285
01:26:54,559 --> 01:26:55,135
LAURA: Okay.

1286
01:26:55,135 --> 01:26:56,767
MARISHA: Like when you see like knights--

1287
01:26:56,767 --> 01:26:58,073
LIAM: It's like Medieval Times.

1288
01:26:58,073 --> 01:27:01,591
MARISHA: Yeah. "I'm going for the green knight!"
That.

1289
01:27:01,591 --> 01:27:07,703
MATT: He's shouting out-- you get very quick
instance: he's a town crier. As you come into

1290
01:27:07,703 --> 01:27:10,723
Zadash, you can see this is probably how a lot of
news is disseminated amongst the populace here.

1291
01:27:10,723 --> 01:27:12,001
MARISHA: Ooh, what's he saying?

1292
01:27:12,001 --> 01:27:19,369
MATT: What you hear approaching is, (shouting) "--
a crownsguard and the King's grace! Attack on

1293
01:27:19,369 --> 01:27:26,482
Alfield is ended! Terrible fiends responsible put
to the sword by a crownsguard and the King's grace!"

1294
01:27:26,482 --> 01:27:28,670
SAM: Hey! We did that! That was us!

1295
01:27:28,670 --> 01:27:32,857
MATT: "The attack on Alf--" He repeats it as he
continues down the street.

1296
01:27:32,857 --> 01:27:33,758
LAURA: Aw, man!

1297
01:27:33,758 --> 01:27:35,384
SAM: They stole our thunder!

1298
01:27:36,454 --> 01:27:37,794
TALIESIN: But not our gold.

1299
01:27:37,794 --> 01:27:39,477
SAM and LAURA: That's true.

1300
01:27:39,477 --> 01:27:40,368
TALIESIN: Thank you.

1301
01:27:40,368 --> 01:27:44,253
TRAVIS: Although, I mean, credit would help our,
you know, reputation.

1302
01:27:44,253 --> 01:27:45,994
LAURA: Yeah! We could be famous!

1303
01:27:45,994 --> 01:27:48,014
TALIESIN: Why would you want to be famous?

1304
01:27:48,014 --> 01:27:50,194
MARISHA: What do you expect from the Crownsguard,
though?

1305
01:27:50,194 --> 01:27:51,433
LAURA: Have you ever been famous?

1306
01:27:51,433 --> 01:27:53,310
TALIESIN: No, I have no interest in becoming it,
thank you very much.

1307
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:56,359
LAURA: You have no idea the kind of stuff that
is given to you when you're famous.

1308
01:27:56,359 --> 01:27:59,020
TALIESIN: I have most everything I need already.
Why would I need more stuff?

1309
01:27:59,020 --> 01:28:03,381
TRAVIS: Jester, any interest in chasing down that
guy and seeing where the news is gathered? Maybe

1310
01:28:03,381 --> 01:28:05,092
they could print a retraction.

1311
01:28:06,432 --> 01:28:08,331
LAURA: Want me to go tell him he's got it wrong?

1312
01:28:09,241 --> 01:28:10,335
TRAVIS: Or where it comes from?

1313
01:28:10,335 --> 01:28:11,598
LAURA: Okay I chase after him.

1314
01:28:11,598 --> 01:28:12,071
TALIESIN: No!

1315
01:28:12,071 --> 01:28:14,216
MARISHA: He's going to think you're crazy!

1316
01:28:14,216 --> 01:28:18,106
LIAM: Also, I'm sorry, some of you wish to be in
the spotlight with the things that we do?

1317
01:28:18,106 --> 01:28:20,000
LAURA: I chased after him already.

1318
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,488
MATT: Okay. He's moved onto-- it looks like he's
cycling through different pieces of news, and as

1319
01:28:24,488 --> 01:28:30,721
you approach, he's shouting, "Families missing in
Nogvurot! Crick kidnappers steal them away in the

1320
01:28:30,926 --> 01:28:37,880
night! Lock and seal your windows and doors while
you slumber! The attack on Alfield has ended!

1321
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:40,803
Terrible--" and you approach him at that point.

1322
01:28:41,703 --> 01:28:43,374
LAURA: Excuse me, town crier man?

1323
01:28:44,484 --> 01:28:45,259
MATT: "Yeah?"

1324
01:28:46,459 --> 01:28:48,377
LAURA: Where does your news come from?

1325
01:28:50,487 --> 01:28:53,549
MATT: "From my boss."

1326
01:28:53,549 --> 01:28:55,845
LAURA: Where is your boss located?

1327
01:28:55,845 --> 01:28:57,699
MATT: "It's the King's Hall."

1328
01:28:57,699 --> 01:29:04,112
LAURA: Because your boss at the King's Hall has
some of his news-- his news is wrong. Did you

1329
01:29:04,112 --> 01:29:10,622
know that the attack on Alfield was defeated by a
group called the Mighty Nein? They're this really

1330
01:29:10,622 --> 01:29:11,464
amazing band of heroes--

1331
01:29:11,464 --> 01:29:12,593
MATT: "I was not aware. I did not know."

1332
01:29:12,593 --> 01:29:13,249
LAURA: Yes--

1333
01:29:13,249 --> 01:29:14,277
MATT: "That's really interesting."

1334
01:29:14,277 --> 01:29:18,021
LAURA: Yes, it is, it's really cool. Because we
were there and we saw it happen and it was really

1335
01:29:18,021 --> 01:29:20,287
cool and you should probably get your news
right--

1336
01:29:20,287 --> 01:29:24,808
MATT: "That sounds amazing. You should go tell
that to the Herald of the Hall. He's probably the

1337
01:29:24,808 --> 01:29:26,185
one who would care the most."

1338
01:29:26,185 --> 01:29:30,614
LAURA: Okay, because by the time, though, that we
get there, and then it gets back to you, you've

1339
01:29:30,614 --> 01:29:36,503
probably been around town so much, and then you'll
have to retract your article, and that would be

1340
01:29:36,503 --> 01:29:37,236
really weird.

1341
01:29:37,236 --> 01:29:42,183
MATT: (shouting) "The attack on Alfield--" and he
quickly gets away from you, repeating the process

1342
01:29:42,183 --> 01:29:42,896
over and over again.

1343
01:29:42,896 --> 01:29:48,546
LIAM: Also, Fjord walks right up behind Jester and
says: (deeper voice) Come on, we need to get back

1344
01:29:48,546 --> 01:29:53,964
with the others. Okay? This is not a good idea to
put yourself out in the open, let's go.

1345
01:29:53,964 --> 01:29:54,519
LAURA: Fjord?

1346
01:29:54,519 --> 01:29:56,560
LIAM: (deeper voice) Yes, it's me, I'm Fjord. Come
on.

1347
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:59,760
LAURA: What is this? Is this a new accent you're
trying out?

1348
01:30:01,230 --> 01:30:03,455
LIAM: There was a cough drop stuck in the side of
my mouth.

1349
01:30:03,455 --> 01:30:04,769
MARISHA: Like Arnold Schwarzenegger.

1350
01:30:05,689 --> 01:30:07,893
LAURA: Fjord, you almost sound like Caleb.

1351
01:30:07,893 --> 01:30:09,467
LIAM: This is deep Texan, I don't know--

1352
01:30:09,467 --> 01:30:13,225
LAURA: Are you planning on sounding like Caleb
now?

1353
01:30:13,225 --> 01:30:16,316
LIAM: Listen, accents are not my strong suit.
Would you please just stop talking to the town

1354
01:30:16,316 --> 01:30:19,731
crier? Thank you. I'm trying to drag her back.

1355
01:30:19,731 --> 01:30:24,420
LAURA: What are you talking about? Accents are
your strong suit. You're really good at it, Fjord!

1356
01:30:24,421 --> 01:30:25,621
TRAVIS: You look like me?

1357
01:30:25,621 --> 01:30:27,286
MATT: You trying to drag her along?

1358
01:30:27,286 --> 01:30:28,637
LIAM: Yeah, back towards the group.

1359
01:30:28,637 --> 01:30:29,794
MATT: Do you let him drag you?

1360
01:30:31,244 --> 01:30:34,393
LAURA: Yeah. Wait, can I tell it's not actually
him?

1361
01:30:34,393 --> 01:30:35,387
LIAM: Probably.

1362
01:30:35,387 --> 01:30:37,011
LAURA: Can I tell it's not Fjord?

1363
01:30:38,471 --> 01:30:43,010
LIAM: It sounds about as good as I just did.
Caleb's not good at accents.

1364
01:30:43,010 --> 01:30:44,057
TRAVIS: But Fjord does accents.

1365
01:30:44,057 --> 01:30:53,554
LAURA: That's the thing. Can I tell from the
physicality? Because you do accents.

1366
01:30:53,554 --> 01:30:54,889
MATT: That's interesting.

1367
01:30:56,499 --> 01:30:58,079
LIAM: I am Fjord Tough, let's go.

1368
01:31:00,439 --> 01:31:05,683
LAURA: Fjord, you seem even weaker than you were
before, pulling me along. This is weird.

1369
01:31:08,263 --> 01:31:11,538
LIAM: But I don't smell bad. Now come on, let's go
to the rest of the group.

1370
01:31:11,538 --> 01:31:16,271
LAURA: (gasps) Caleb? Is it really you?

1371
01:31:16,271 --> 01:31:19,236
LIAM: I pull her by the earlobe. Can we please go
back to the rest?

1372
01:31:19,236 --> 01:31:23,033
LAURA: Okay, just let go of my ear now, okay.

1373
01:31:25,473 --> 01:31:32,440
LIAM: I'm sorry. Is this what we are going to be
about? Huge credit, and get ourselves to be part

1374
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:33,300
of the news?

1375
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:37,164
LAURA: Hey man, I was just doing what Fjord told
me to, okay? So don't you give me shit!

1376
01:31:37,164 --> 01:31:42,249
LIAM: I am not giving you shit, I am putting a
subject on the table for the group. I need to make

1377
01:31:42,249 --> 01:31:46,864
an informed decision about what Nott and I are
doing.

1378
01:31:48,224 --> 01:31:49,863
TALIESIN: I prefer to keep it on the down-low,
personally.

1379
01:31:49,863 --> 01:31:53,852
TRAVIS: Yeah, of course. Not to alarm you, I only
meant that if we are going to be paid for our

1380
01:31:53,852 --> 01:32:00,342
escapades, a reputation, anonymously, might help,
if we belong to that name.

1381
01:32:00,342 --> 01:32:02,587
MARISHA: You want an anonymous reputation?

1382
01:32:02,587 --> 01:32:08,418
LAURA: Oh my gosh! This is perfect! Because if
we're called the Mighty Nein, people will expect

1383
01:32:08,418 --> 01:32:10,528
it to be a different group of people.

1384
01:32:10,528 --> 01:32:11,773
SAM: Because we're just six?

1385
01:32:11,773 --> 01:32:15,684
LAURA: Yeah. That's actually brilliant.

1386
01:32:17,214 --> 01:32:20,036
SAM: We're disguised! We're hiding in plain
sight!

1387
01:32:23,226 --> 01:32:28,721
MATT: As you say that, across the way, you can see
there's one crotchety-looking dude with one eye

1388
01:32:28,721 --> 01:32:29,257
who's like--

1389
01:32:31,247 --> 01:32:32,748
TALIESIN: I'm going to look right back at him.

1390
01:32:34,208 --> 01:32:35,765
MATT: Averts his gaze and keeps on walking.

1391
01:32:37,225 --> 01:32:38,556
TALIESIN: Do I have something in my teeth?

1392
01:32:40,486 --> 01:32:43,309
MARISHA: Plus, what makes you assume we're about
anything right now? I don't think we've made any

1393
01:32:43,309 --> 01:32:46,890
decisions. I thought we were just having fun,
right? Making good money?

1394
01:32:46,890 --> 01:32:48,287
TALIESIN: I'm here for making money.

1395
01:32:48,287 --> 01:32:49,972
MARISHA: Are we about anything?

1396
01:32:49,972 --> 01:32:50,779
TRAVIS: No.

1397
01:32:52,199 --> 01:32:54,705
MARISHA. Yeah. Do you want to be about something?

1398
01:32:54,705 --> 01:32:58,090
LIAM: I don't want to be about making a stink
everywhere we go.

1399
01:32:58,090 --> 01:33:00,490
TALIESIN: This is what happens after you go to
meetings, is suddenly you want to be about

1400
01:33:00,490 --> 01:33:01,355
something. Be careful.

1401
01:33:01,355 --> 01:33:03,636
TRAVIS: That's not true. Caleb, I'm sorry.

1402
01:33:03,636 --> 01:33:04,975
MARISHA: I didn't say it, he did!

1403
01:33:04,975 --> 01:33:07,486
TRAVIS: If we put you at unease, that was not our
intention.

1404
01:33:07,486 --> 01:33:12,900
LIAM: It's not just me. You are vomiting salt
water, and you are getting into fistfights with

1405
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:15,699
people, I don't know what you're doing. And you--
Look at you.

1406
01:33:15,699 --> 01:33:17,281
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait.

1407
01:33:18,501 --> 01:33:21,906
TRAVIS: "Look at you" is always the worst. Look at
you!

1408
01:33:21,906 --> 01:33:26,916
TALIESIN: I'm well aware. This is entirely for the
sake of my mirror. I'm very well aware.

1409
01:33:28,216 --> 01:33:34,263
MARISHA: We're the ones that you don't know?
What's going on with-- You two take off every day!

1410
01:33:34,263 --> 01:33:41,034
The two of you! Maybe you would know what we're up
to if you went along with the group once!

1411
01:33:42,214 --> 01:33:43,234
LIAM: Go along with the group?

1412
01:33:43,234 --> 01:33:47,445
LAURA: He always knows what we're up to because he
has his cat follow us.

1413
01:33:47,445 --> 01:33:48,088
LIAM: Yeah.

1414
01:33:48,088 --> 01:33:50,743
MARISHA: Yeah, super personable.

1415
01:33:50,743 --> 01:33:56,045
LIAM: I have fought a giant toad creature with
you. I have fought a big lion thing with a woman's face.

1416
01:33:56,056 --> 01:33:57,512
TALIESIN: I propose a plan.

1417
01:33:57,512 --> 01:33:58,528
LAURA: You killed its baby!

1418
01:33:58,528 --> 01:34:01,432
SAM: I did. I feel very bad about that.

1419
01:34:01,432 --> 01:34:06,918
TALIESIN: I have a plan for this. I have a plan,
we're going to take our scrap and we're going to

1420
01:34:06,918 --> 01:34:11,520
sell it, so that we have some money. We're going
to take the good feelings from that money and

1421
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:15,702
we're going to spend it on hot water and
inappropriate, friendly nudity.

1422
01:34:15,702 --> 01:34:16,687
LAURA: Yeah!

1423
01:34:16,687 --> 01:34:23,104
TALIESIN: And we're going to have a discussion
about what we're doing, with heat, steam, water

1424
01:34:23,390 --> 01:34:24,778
and a little bit of cash.

1425
01:34:25,168 --> 01:34:28,267
MARISHA: Okay, you're super insistent about this,
so I'm going to go with it.

1426
01:34:28,267 --> 01:34:29,644
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'm down for it, too.

1427
01:34:29,644 --> 01:34:32,210
MARISHA: Because now I feel like it's real
important to you.

1428
01:34:32,210 --> 01:34:35,212
TALIESIN: I just find it's easier to have this
conversation when everyone is sitting around naked

1429
01:34:35,212 --> 01:34:35,949
in hot water.

1430
01:34:35,949 --> 01:34:39,923
TRAVIS: Molly, I expect you to lead this escapade.
Please, lead on.

1431
01:34:39,923 --> 01:34:42,909
MARISHA: Sherpa us to our first bathhouse
experience.

1432
01:34:42,909 --> 01:34:44,798
TALIESIN: I take five steps and then I go, I don't
know where the blacksmith is.

1433
01:34:44,798 --> 01:34:45,833
LAURA: I'll lead the way!

1434
01:34:45,833 --> 01:34:50,113
TRAVIS: Five steps in a circle.

1435
01:34:50,113 --> 01:34:59,025
LIAM: As everybody walks, to Beau I say: Listen
it's just about logistics. I mean you are very--

1436
01:34:59,025 --> 01:34:59,978
TRAVIS: Do you still look like me?

1437
01:34:59,978 --> 01:35:05,011
LIAM: No, I dropped it. You are in peak physical
condition, your guns are amazing. I can't do

1438
01:35:05,471 --> 01:35:09,760
what you do. I can't run into it, of course. I'm
100 yards back, because I'm thin as a wet toilet paper.

1439
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:11,746
MARISHA: Thanks man, thanks.

1440
01:35:12,332 --> 01:35:13,536
LAURA: Thin as a wet toilet paper?

1441
01:35:13,536 --> 01:35:22,042
MARISHA: I'm sorry, were you trying to tell me
about-- I'm sorry, what? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1442
01:35:22,042 --> 01:35:28,213
LIAM: I've got to stop complimenting you, it does
not lead to good moments. I walk away.

1443
01:35:28,213 --> 01:35:34,858
MARISHA: Okay wait! Damn it! First time Liam's
walked away from me in the campaign!

1444
01:35:34,858 --> 01:35:42,544
MATT: Following Jester, you make your way back to
the Pentamarket, to the outside of the Spark

1445
01:35:42,544 --> 01:35:47,160
Hammer Smithing. What was previously closed the
night before, you can now see the open air smithy

1446
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:55,084
is lively and banging. You can hear the slamming
of hammer on metal and the shower of sparks from

1447
01:35:55,084 --> 01:36:05,962
the exterior anvil setup. Currently out there is a
halfling man with deeply tanned, red skin, short,

1448
01:36:05,962 --> 01:36:15,000
black hair and very muscular arms, who currently
has leather gloves on, leather apron, and is in

1449
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:21,154
the process of forging some kind of long metal
blade, hammering it out over a heavy anvil on the

1450
01:36:21,154 --> 01:36:30,418
outside. There is the trough for the quenching of
the blade and then in the interior you can see, a

1451
01:36:30,418 --> 01:36:37,082
few steps away, the orange glow of the rest of the
blacksmith interior. There looks to be somebody

1452
01:36:37,082 --> 01:36:42,370
else on the inside but you don't get a view of
them right now. You can just barely get rows and

1453
01:36:42,370 --> 01:36:46,208
rows and racks of various pieces of armor and
weapons that are currently hanging on display on

1454
01:36:46,208 --> 01:36:50,007
the inside. There is nobody in the process of
walking through at the moment, just in the process

1455
01:36:50,007 --> 01:36:57,472
of crafting, so you are the only individuals who
are holding the space at the moment. So the (metal

1456
01:36:57,472 --> 01:37:02,133
clanging), turn, (metal clanging).

1457
01:37:02,133 --> 01:37:05,455
LAURA: I take my pink bag and I put it down on the
table in front of him.

1458
01:37:05,455 --> 01:37:10,778
MATT: (Metal clanging "Hello?"

1459
01:37:10,778 --> 01:37:14,274
LAURA: Hi! We have things to buy and sell from
you.

1460
01:37:14,274 --> 01:37:20,469
MATT: "Well, I'm all certainly here for that. What
you got? What you looking to buy?"

1461
01:37:20,469 --> 01:37:26,380
LAURA: I pull out-- Well it depends, do you have a
hand axe that I could buy?

1462
01:37:26,380 --> 01:37:36,902
MATT: He sets the hammer into the water, the steam
rises up, quenches the blade, takes the gloves off

1463
01:37:36,902 --> 01:37:47,298
and wipes heavy sweat from the brow. "You're
looking for a--?"

1464
01:37:47,298 --> 01:37:51,280
LAURA: Hand axe! Something that is very sharp and
can kill people!

1465
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:58,531
MATT: "That I can do." Turns around to the inside
of the building and comes back. He has two hand

1466
01:37:58,531 --> 01:38:02,382
axes, both look pretty well made, one looks a
little more intricate than the other, but both are

1467
01:38:02,382 --> 01:38:07,860
pretty solid. "So we got these two." Throws one
and catches it, throws the other and catches it.

1468
01:38:07,860 --> 01:38:15,948
LAURA: Okay, put those on the table and then we
will look at some other stuff first. Okay! I have

1469
01:38:15,948 --> 01:38:24,234
six short swords, and I put them down on the
table. I've got two daggers here! I've got two

1470
01:38:24,234 --> 01:38:29,219
hand crossbows! Two light crossbows and two heavy
crossbows!

1471
01:38:29,219 --> 01:38:36,986
MATT: You place them all down and looking at the
quality and the shininess and the smooth, fresh

1472
01:38:36,986 --> 01:38:46,933
weaponry that he's placed on the table and the
pockmarked, used, damaged, in some cases gnoll

1473
01:38:46,933 --> 01:38:51,918
mess covered weaponry, you immediately realize--
oh.

1474
01:38:51,918 --> 01:38:54,335
LAURA: Maybe scrap metal is a good thing for this.

1475
01:38:54,335 --> 01:39:02,400
MATT: "I say so, these have all seen some use. Not
all that great. Sorry."

1476
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:05,315
LAURA: But also! Also, we have some other things!

1477
01:39:05,315 --> 01:39:13,649
MARISHA: There were then chains, the manacles.
Cart, we definitely drug here. Definitely around

1478
01:39:13,649 --> 01:39:14,357
Fjord's neck.

1479
01:39:14,357 --> 01:39:15,386
SAM: We're selling these things?

1480
01:39:15,386 --> 01:39:16,589
TRAVIS: Are they in the bag?

1481
01:39:16,589 --> 01:39:17,544
LAURA: I have them!

1482
01:39:17,544 --> 01:39:18,711
MARISHA: Oh, were they in the bag?

1483
01:39:18,711 --> 01:39:20,933
LAURA: We put everything in the bag, then it would
be good.

1484
01:39:20,933 --> 01:39:25,947
MATT: You couldn't fit the manacles in the bag.
The one that was around the neck of the manticore.

1485
01:39:25,973 --> 01:39:27,764
LAURA: Then we fucking had them around our necks.

1486
01:39:28,513 --> 01:39:30,537
MATT: Yeah, you had them in the cart. So you bring
them along with you.

1487
01:39:30,537 --> 01:39:32,170
LAURA: We knew we were going to the blacksmith.

1488
01:39:32,170 --> 01:39:35,711
MATT: "Well these here, these are some nice
metal."

1489
01:39:35,711 --> 01:39:37,592
LAURA: And they were magic!

1490
01:39:37,592 --> 01:39:39,709
MATT: "They were magic."

1491
01:39:39,709 --> 01:39:41,348
MARISHA: I show him the rune.

1492
01:39:41,348 --> 01:39:43,835
LAURA: They had to be real good metal to be magic!

1493
01:39:43,835 --> 01:39:48,407
MATT: "Let me have a look at that." He takes them,
pulls on the chains, drags for a minute and he

1494
01:39:48,407 --> 01:39:52,831
inspects them over. "This some real nice
craftsmanship, you don't see something this well

1495
01:39:52,831 --> 01:39:56,802
made. So where did you get this?"

1496
01:39:56,802 --> 01:40:03,413
LAURA: This giant lion thing with a woman's head
had them around it and then we killed the lion

1497
01:40:03,413 --> 01:40:04,344
thing.

1498
01:40:04,344 --> 01:40:05,924
SAM: We found it.

1499
01:40:05,924 --> 01:40:08,977
MATT: Did you guys bring the cart with you?

1500
01:40:08,977 --> 01:40:13,038
TALIESIN: Well, if we got there then yeah,
probably.

1501
01:40:13,038 --> 01:40:20,647
MATT: He glances past you. Well, the manticore
head is still affixed to the cart, by the way. The

1502
01:40:20,647 --> 01:40:28,374
halfling looks past and he goes, "I'll take it you
mean that thing. It's quite scary, well done. Ah,

1503
01:40:28,374 --> 01:40:36,118
looking at all the weapons. The wood's mostly
rotted, unfortunately. Some of the metal can be

1504
01:40:36,118 --> 01:40:44,264
melted down and reused, have to hammer out all of
the imperfections, smelt it all. The manacles look

1505
01:40:44,264 --> 01:40:52,350
very nice. Tell you what. Give me the lot and the
manacles, I'll give you both these axes and be in

1506
01:40:52,350 --> 01:40:54,873
excess of about 20 gold pieces."

1507
01:40:54,873 --> 01:40:57,886
LAURA: Do we want both of the axes or just the
one?

1508
01:40:57,886 --> 01:40:59,235
SAM: Why do we need any axes?

1509
01:40:59,235 --> 01:41:05,042
LAURA: I need another weapon. Just one of the axes
is all I need. I don't need both.

1510
01:41:05,042 --> 01:41:09,044
MATT: "Put that at about 25 gold then, and the one
axe."

1511
01:41:09,044 --> 01:41:10,435
LAURA: Sound good for you guys?

1512
01:41:10,435 --> 01:41:11,608
TALIESIN: Works for me.

1513
01:41:11,608 --> 01:41:12,473
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1514
01:41:12,473 --> 01:41:16,084
LAURA: I like it. I think that is a very good
deal. What's your name, sir?

1515
01:41:16,084 --> 01:41:19,426
MATT: "Sorry about that. Yannick. Yannick Dumel.

1516
01:41:19,426 --> 01:41:25,320
LAURA: Yannick. I'm Jester. It's nice to meet you.

1517
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:31,717
MATT: "Nice to meet you as well, Jester. Inside
there is Jan. She helps run the place. Fantastic.

1518
01:41:31,717 --> 01:41:33,143
I'll go get your gold for you."

1519
01:41:33,143 --> 01:41:35,458
SAM: Do you sell flasks?

1520
01:41:35,458 --> 01:41:41,250
MATT: "I do not work in smaller bits of metal,
unfortunately. More the hefty kind. My apologies.

1521
01:41:41,250 --> 01:41:45,722
If you're looking for flasks--" Takes a moment and
thinks of something. "There's Wares & Ends.

1522
01:41:45,722 --> 01:41:48,849
They've probably got something there for you.
There's Packwearer's Provisions, they probably got

1523
01:41:48,849 --> 01:41:54,815
flasks around there. Well, they probably have some
at the Lodge of the Eclipse, that's possible."

1524
01:41:54,815 --> 01:41:56,127
TRAVIS: Lodge of the Eclipse?

1525
01:41:56,127 --> 01:42:02,811
MATT: "Right, right. That's the more hoity-toity
night time tavern here in the Pentamarket."

1526
01:42:02,811 --> 01:42:04,896
TALIESIN: Why is it called Lodge of the Eclipse?

1527
01:42:04,896 --> 01:42:07,537
MATT: "Because at nighttime they has the great
shows on stage."

1528
01:42:07,537 --> 01:42:15,826
MARISHA: You know anyone that might want a scary
lion head thing to decorate their walls?

1529
01:42:15,826 --> 01:42:18,622
LAURA: Specifically one that's melting.

1530
01:42:18,622 --> 01:42:21,993
TALIESIN: Is there is a taxidermist, is what I
think she's asking.

1531
01:42:21,993 --> 01:42:26,444
MATT: "I don't know about a taxidermist,
unfortunately. I'm pretty sure if you ask around

1532
01:42:26,444 --> 01:42:33,496
you can find someone willing to pay for that. I
probably ask the Hall of Erudition, they deal in

1533
01:42:33,496 --> 01:42:39,284
weird things and strange beasties. Sorry about
that."

1534
01:42:39,284 --> 01:42:42,352
MARISHA: What did you say the fancy tavern was?

1535
01:42:42,352 --> 01:42:43,460
MATT: "Lodge of the Eclipse."

1536
01:42:43,460 --> 01:42:45,447
MARISHA: Lodge of the Eclipse.

1537
01:42:45,447 --> 01:42:49,316
LIAM: We might be able to take it to a school or a
medical facility to sell. Studies.

1538
01:42:49,316 --> 01:42:53,609
LAURA: Yeah.

1539
01:42:53,609 --> 01:42:55,682
TRAVIS: I'm good.

1540
01:42:55,682 --> 01:42:56,859
SAM: Let's go.

1541
01:42:56,859 --> 01:43:02,134
MATT: All right. You guys head on towards where
now?

1542
01:43:02,134 --> 01:43:02,855
LAURA: The bath!

1543
01:43:02,855 --> 01:43:07,101
LIAM: We're in the pentagram, penta--

1544
01:43:07,101 --> 01:43:07,772
MATT: Pentamarket.

1545
01:43:07,772 --> 01:43:12,246
LIAM: So we're close to the library? I thought it
was in that area.

1546
01:43:12,246 --> 01:43:21,306
MATT: No, the library is-- the Archive you're
talking about. It's in the western side of the Pentamarket.

1547
01:43:21,851 --> 01:43:27,083
LIAM: Okay, so we're closer now then we were. I
don't see the entrance from where we are, or do we?

1548
01:43:27,633 --> 01:43:32,178
MATT: No, it's not one of the tallest towers in
the city. In fact, the Tri-Spires, as it's called,

1549
01:43:32,178 --> 01:43:35,944
has three massive towers of all different designs
that lord over the rest of the city. They're the

1550
01:43:35,944 --> 01:43:41,219
first things you saw when you crested the hill on
the way into the city the night before. This one

1551
01:43:41,219 --> 01:43:45,616
is still visible from your perspective, though.
It's a little more squat and maybe four or five

1552
01:43:45,616 --> 01:43:46,242
stories tall.

1553
01:43:46,242 --> 01:43:48,703
LIAM: The whole kit and caboodle is visible from
here?

1554
01:43:48,703 --> 01:43:52,781
MATT: Well, you can see where the Archive is but
it's maybe another ten minute walk to get there.

1555
01:43:53,304 --> 01:44:00,317
LIAM: Okay. Does anyone mind if we swing by and
just take a look at the Archive? Not go in, you

1556
01:44:00,317 --> 01:44:02,754
know, we have other things we're going to do, but
just to take a look.

1557
01:44:02,754 --> 01:44:04,464
TRAVIS: At the outside?

1558
01:44:04,464 --> 01:44:06,665
MARISHA: It's a bit of a tourist trap, but sure.

1559
01:44:06,665 --> 01:44:08,236
LIAM: You have seen it before?

1560
01:44:08,236 --> 01:44:10,652
MARISHA: Yeah, I lived here for like a short time,
passed through.

1561
01:44:10,652 --> 01:44:13,396
LIAM: Okay, how long did you do that?

1562
01:44:13,396 --> 01:44:13,850
MARISHA: A few months.

1563
01:44:13,850 --> 01:44:16,665
LIAM: Okay. Well, I am a tourist.

1564
01:44:16,665 --> 01:44:18,113
MARISHA: Yeah, it's pretty.

1565
01:44:20,203 --> 01:44:21,386
TRAVIS: If it's on the way sure.

1566
01:44:21,386 --> 01:44:22,300
LIAM: Okay.

1567
01:44:22,300 --> 01:44:25,613
TALIESIN: Is the board between here and there? The
job board.

1568
01:44:26,493 --> 01:44:28,507
TRAVIS: Oh, the postings, yeah. What was it?

1569
01:44:28,507 --> 01:44:29,838
SAM: The King's Hall.

1570
01:44:29,838 --> 01:44:37,167
TRAVIS: The King's Hall. Where the Herald of the
Hall is. Where we can get that retraction.

1571
01:44:37,167 --> 01:44:41,867
MATT: The King's Hall is actually not that far
from the Archive. It would be a brief detour to

1572
01:44:41,867 --> 01:44:42,425
get there.

1573
01:44:42,425 --> 01:44:46,650
TALIESIN: We can do a couple to the Archive,
couple to the King's Hall. Just pick it up.

1574
01:44:46,650 --> 01:44:48,334
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's cool.

1575
01:44:48,334 --> 01:44:51,312
LIAM: Would you like to show me the Archive? Not the
inside, the outside.

1576
01:44:53,682 --> 01:44:55,747
MARISHA: I think it's this direction, if I
remember.

1577
01:44:55,747 --> 01:44:59,888
LIAM: Never mind, I don't want to put you out.
Anyone want to go see the Archive?

1578
01:44:59,888 --> 01:45:01,621
TRAVIS: Enthusiasm, Beau, enthusiasm.

1579
01:45:01,621 --> 01:45:02,673
MARISHA: Aww, fuck.

1580
01:45:02,673 --> 01:45:05,472
TRAVIS: Come on, work on what we did, come on.

1581
01:45:05,472 --> 01:45:06,593
MARISHA: I don't think Caleb likes me.

1582
01:45:06,593 --> 01:45:07,577
TRAVIS: Just try, give it a whirl.

1583
01:45:07,577 --> 01:45:08,101
MARISHA: All right.

1584
01:45:08,101 --> 01:45:10,077
SAM: It would be great if you could both take
me!

1585
01:45:12,217 --> 01:45:14,334
MARISHA: All right. Hey, Caleb!

1586
01:45:14,334 --> 01:45:14,748
LIAM: Yeah?

1587
01:45:16,238 --> 01:45:17,081
MARISHA: Right this way!

1588
01:45:18,691 --> 01:45:19,556
LAURA: She's really scary.

1589
01:45:19,556 --> 01:45:20,406
TRAVIS: (whispering) Yeah!

1590
01:45:20,406 --> 01:45:23,626
MARISHA: Is that-- fuck. Was that all right?
Fuck.

1591
01:45:23,626 --> 01:45:26,536
LIAM: It's just a volume thing sometimes. Okay
let's go look--

1592
01:45:26,536 --> 01:45:27,947
MARISHA: (louder) He said enthusiasm!

1593
01:45:27,947 --> 01:45:28,574
LIAM: Oh jeez!

1594
01:45:28,574 --> 01:45:31,296
MARISHA: Was that not...? Let's go this way.

1595
01:45:31,296 --> 01:45:31,896
TRAVIS: Baby steps.

1596
01:45:31,896 --> 01:45:33,667
MATT: All right, so where are you heading first?

1597
01:45:34,497 --> 01:45:35,141
LIAM: The Archive.

1598
01:45:35,141 --> 01:45:39,369
MATT: The Archive, okay. On the way another town
crier crosses by; another individual, same garb, a

1599
01:45:39,369 --> 01:45:51,108
middle aged woman, hair pulled back into a very
tight bun with the tufts of curled hair around the

1600
01:45:51,108 --> 01:45:58,399
edges. Same tabard in the front and she's shouting
out, "Riot in Rexxentrum squashed for peace!

1601
01:45:58,399 --> 01:46:01,865
Radical groups brought to justice under the
crown!"

1602
01:46:01,865 --> 01:46:03,196
MARISHA: Ooh!

1603
01:46:03,196 --> 01:46:04,167
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

1604
01:46:04,167 --> 01:46:06,893
MARISHA: Ooh, that's some dirty fucking shit.

1605
01:46:06,893 --> 01:46:12,277
LAURA: I follow behind her and yell: Town crier
has toilet paper stuck to her shoe!

1606
01:46:12,277 --> 01:46:15,619
(laughter)

1607
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:19,237
MATT: In the middle of her next line, "Two weeks
to--"

1608
01:46:23,237 --> 01:46:25,203
LIAM: So you do know what toilet paper is.

1609
01:46:28,243 --> 01:46:32,629
MATT: "Two weeks' time to the Harvest Close
Festival! Victory Pit in the Pentamarket, entry

1610
01:46:32,629 --> 01:46:34,561
begins in four days!"

1611
01:46:34,561 --> 01:46:37,030
LAURA: Wait, what did she just say?

1612
01:46:37,030 --> 01:46:37,793
MARISHA: Harvest Festival?

1613
01:46:37,793 --> 01:46:39,806
MATT: Harvest Close Festival.

1614
01:46:39,806 --> 01:46:41,909
MARISHA: Harvest Close.

1615
01:46:41,909 --> 01:46:44,324
MATT: Harvest Close. It's the end of the harvest.

1616
01:46:44,324 --> 01:46:45,592
MARISHA: It's in two weeks?

1617
01:46:45,592 --> 01:46:47,147
MATT: In two weeks.

1618
01:46:47,147 --> 01:46:48,874
MARISHA: In a fortnight.

1619
01:46:48,874 --> 01:46:52,469
MATT: In the Victory Pit in the Pentamarket. Entry
begins in four days.

1620
01:46:52,469 --> 01:46:54,388
MARISHA: Victory Pit!

1621
01:46:54,388 --> 01:46:57,578
LAURA: We need to get a really big piece of
vegetable.

1622
01:46:57,578 --> 01:47:01,552
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah! Big pumpkins.

1623
01:47:04,212 --> 01:47:09,109
MATT: You eventually find your way to the outside
of the Archive. Where you had seen was the

1624
01:47:09,109 --> 01:47:15,497
tapering tower that had the dome, with the
polished sun reflection on one side, the rest of

1625
01:47:15,497 --> 01:47:19,783
it you can see with the intricate carvings that
happen with each bit of the spiral as it continues

1626
01:47:19,783 --> 01:47:26,182
downward. You can see three specific smaller
spires that from this perspective make it look

1627
01:47:26,182 --> 01:47:35,561
like, I would say, almost like a TIE fighter on
its side. It has a series of smaller three spires

1628
01:47:35,561 --> 01:47:40,173
at the base and a central spire that is the
mainstay of the library. You can see there's a

1629
01:47:40,173 --> 01:47:47,710
double door at the base and a number of
individuals dressed in deep grey robes with blue

1630
01:47:47,710 --> 01:48:01,142
sashes, very gray and blue color scheme. As you
approach, the outside of it you can see folks

1631
01:48:01,142 --> 01:48:10,440
entering in and out but as they enter and exit the
facility they usually enter and exit under the

1632
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:12,986
watch and being escorted by one of these
individuals that seem to be members of the Archive.

1633
01:48:12,986 --> 01:48:13,869
LIAM: Okay.

1634
01:48:13,869 --> 01:48:15,223
TRAVIS: Sure is pretty.

1635
01:48:17,723 --> 01:48:20,584
LIAM: I would just like to look around. It's in a
square, you say?

1636
01:48:20,584 --> 01:48:25,742
MATT: It's built off of one of the main roads that
leads in the direction of where the King's Hall

1637
01:48:25,742 --> 01:48:30,222
is. So it's not in a major square area, but it's
off a large road.

1638
01:48:30,222 --> 01:48:35,577
LIAM: Yeah? Well I am no super spy, but I would
like to just look at the area and see what I see

1639
01:48:35,577 --> 01:48:41,581
in the nature of security, other than these
obvious robed figures.

1640
01:48:43,681 --> 01:48:50,348
MATT: All the windows that exist are at least
eight feet off the floor and look to be a very

1641
01:48:50,348 --> 01:48:59,093
thick stained glass. The only entrances you see
are currently guarded by at least two members of

1642
01:48:59,093 --> 01:49:04,974
the Archive and the dress of them actually is very
close to the individual that helped in the trial

1643
01:49:04,974 --> 01:49:12,265
that you had in Trostenwald who introduced himself
as Zeenoth, the one who helped provide information

1644
01:49:12,265 --> 01:49:17,662
that eventually got you off the hook for that
trial. You can now see similarities in the color

1645
01:49:17,662 --> 01:49:22,827
scheme of their attire and the way that it's worn.
It's ceremonial. It looks like it comes with a

1646
01:49:22,827 --> 01:49:34,141
ceremonial robe. They're all uniform to a certain
extent with some being more intricate and longer

1647
01:49:34,141 --> 01:49:37,577
with more jewelry and they seem to have a little
more station.

1648
01:49:37,577 --> 01:49:40,428
LIAM: And you said everyone going in and out was
being escorted by one of these individuals?

1649
01:49:40,428 --> 01:49:41,480
MATT: Escorted by one of these, yes.

1650
01:49:41,480 --> 01:49:44,863
LIAM: If I see one or two people going in or out
what do they look like?

1651
01:49:46,263 --> 01:49:51,594
MATT: One of them you see appears to be a woman,
very well dressed, looks to be a high collar, a

1652
01:49:51,594 --> 01:49:57,076
buttoned up blouse of some kind, a dress that just
barely cuts off right where her ankles hit the

1653
01:49:57,076 --> 01:50:02,589
ground with very nice shoes. Looks to be a very
well off humanoid woman, a human.

1654
01:50:02,589 --> 01:50:04,640
SAM: Does she look grumpy?

1655
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:12,198
MATT: She looks stoic. Leaves with a very--
(laughs)

1656
01:50:12,198 --> 01:50:14,114
SAM: Is she leaving or coming?

1657
01:50:14,114 --> 01:50:14,763
MATT: Leaving.

1658
01:50:14,763 --> 01:50:16,112
SAM: I will follow her.

1659
01:50:16,112 --> 01:50:29,887
MATT: Okay. The other one looks to be a man
probably in his late 30s or so, also human. He has

1660
01:50:29,887 --> 01:50:36,217
a cluster of small pieces of parchment that are
folded and wadded into his arm and he's leaving

1661
01:50:36,217 --> 01:50:40,849
like he just was either taking something out or
just retrieving something.

1662
01:50:40,849 --> 01:50:41,894
LIAM: Same fancy type?

1663
01:50:41,894 --> 01:50:46,254
MATT: Less fancy than her, but still more well off
than most of the other individuals that have

1664
01:50:46,254 --> 01:50:46,740
passed through.

1665
01:50:46,740 --> 01:50:48,235
LIAM: Fancier than me?

1666
01:50:48,235 --> 01:50:49,298
MATT: Oh yeah.

1667
01:50:49,298 --> 01:50:55,174
LIAM: Yeah. Okay. That's a beautiful building.
They're all wearing the same thing.

1668
01:50:55,174 --> 01:50:56,406
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

1669
01:50:56,406 --> 01:50:59,711
LIAM: You've lived here for a few months. What do
you know about this place?

1670
01:51:02,251 --> 01:51:05,800
MARISHA: There's a lot of books in it and fancy
people are super interested in it.

1671
01:51:07,490 --> 01:51:12,961
LIAM: Obviously I am very interested in learning.
Is it easy to gain admittance? Do you know that

1672
01:51:12,961 --> 01:51:13,851
sort of thing?

1673
01:51:13,851 --> 01:51:15,570
MARISHA: I'm not entirely sure.

1674
01:51:15,570 --> 01:51:16,302
LIAM: Oh.

1675
01:51:16,302 --> 01:51:19,135
MARISHA: I know that they're super into their
knowledge.

1676
01:51:19,135 --> 01:51:19,730
LIAM: Yeah.

1677
01:51:19,730 --> 01:51:24,103
MARISHA: They're like "Eh, knowledge, means you're
like powerful or something."

1678
01:51:24,103 --> 01:51:25,378
LIAM: Yeah, that's what it means.

1679
01:51:25,378 --> 01:51:26,158
MARISHA: Yeah.

1680
01:51:26,158 --> 01:51:26,706
LIAM: Yeah.

1681
01:51:26,706 --> 01:51:33,376
MARISHA: Knowing's better, yeah, books.

1682
01:51:33,376 --> 01:51:36,567
LIAM: Well, you've really sold me on it, let's go
find the others.

1683
01:51:36,567 --> 01:51:37,146
MARISHA: Yep.

1684
01:51:39,186 --> 01:51:41,888
MATT: While that's happening, you are following
this woman down.

1685
01:51:41,888 --> 01:51:44,341
SAM: I'll try to stay 25 feet behind her.

1686
01:51:44,341 --> 01:51:45,509
MATT: Make a stealth check.

1687
01:51:45,509 --> 01:51:47,740
SAM and LAURA: Ooh.

1688
01:51:47,740 --> 01:51:51,980
SAM: 13? Oh! 15.

1689
01:51:53,510 --> 01:52:01,358
MATT: Okay. No one immediately seems to pay mind
and she's currently eyes on the prize, heading in

1690
01:52:01,358 --> 01:52:08,363
some direction with earnest intent. The escort, of
course, that had helped her out of the Archive

1691
01:52:08,363 --> 01:52:13,807
stays behind and reenters the building, and she
continues on her own, but stays mainly on the main

1692
01:52:13,807 --> 01:52:17,440
streets; doesn't go and duck into any alleyways
very much for her own personal safety during the

1693
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:19,624
day and staying out in the open.

1694
01:52:19,624 --> 01:52:26,911
SAM: Does she have any bag, purse, visible
necklace, pockets, anything pickable?

1695
01:52:26,911 --> 01:52:32,090
MATT: There do appear to be two small pockets in
the front waist part of the blouse and a small

1696
01:52:32,090 --> 01:52:38,522
satchel that's hanging off the right, over the
left shoulder, off the right side of the body.

1697
01:52:38,522 --> 01:52:43,702
LIAM: Do I have any chance in hell knowing where
she went? Because I start looking around immediately.

1698
01:52:43,702 --> 01:52:45,785
MATT: Make a perception check.

1699
01:52:45,785 --> 01:52:48,282
LIAM: Okay, no. That's a one.

1700
01:52:48,282 --> 01:52:51,013
MATT: You have no idea. You come back and Nott's
gone.

1701
01:52:51,013 --> 01:52:53,471
LIAM: (panicked mumbling)

1702
01:52:53,471 --> 01:52:58,233
MARISHA: She's an adult goblin woman girl, she's
fine.

1703
01:52:59,703 --> 01:53:03,193
LIAM: You're not helping me. Like at all.

1704
01:53:05,463 --> 01:53:09,430
MARISHA: Okay, I look around. Do I see Nott? Kind
of haphazardly.

1705
01:53:09,430 --> 01:53:12,939
MATT: No. Not at this point.

1706
01:53:14,209 --> 01:53:16,402
LIAM: We are going to look around now is what
we're doing.

1707
01:53:16,402 --> 01:53:21,009
MATT: While the rest of you are regathering
yourselves together to continue onto the next

1708
01:53:21,009 --> 01:53:22,759
length of your journey, Nott--

1709
01:53:22,759 --> 01:53:28,731
SAM: I'm going to cast Mage Hand and try to pick--
well, let's see, can I unbuckle the satchel thing

1710
01:53:28,731 --> 01:53:31,508
or would it be easier to just get in a pocket?

1711
01:53:32,468 --> 01:53:33,418
MATT: It's up to you.

1712
01:53:33,418 --> 01:53:35,159
SAM: I'll go in a pocket, I guess.

1713
01:53:35,159 --> 01:53:36,125
MATT: The front pocket?

1714
01:53:37,485 --> 01:53:39,449
SAM: You said she had two side pockets, I think?

1715
01:53:39,449 --> 01:53:41,311
MATT: Yeah, the front of the blouse.

1716
01:53:42,681 --> 01:53:44,157
LAURA: Front of the blouse.

1717
01:53:44,157 --> 01:53:48,119
SAM: Front of the blouse or a satchel on her side?

1718
01:53:48,119 --> 01:53:48,876
MATT: Yeah.

1719
01:53:48,876 --> 01:53:50,303
SAM: I'll do the side satchel.

1720
01:53:50,303 --> 01:53:53,067
MATT: Go ahead and roll sleight of hand, please.

1721
01:53:53,067 --> 01:53:53,912
SAM: Okay.

1722
01:53:55,472 --> 01:53:57,161
TRAVIS: (laughing) What is it?

1723
01:53:57,161 --> 01:53:57,587
SAM: 11.

1724
01:53:57,587 --> 01:53:58,670
MATT: Okay.

1725
01:54:00,470 --> 01:54:02,083
TALIESIN: Higher than ten.

1726
01:54:02,083 --> 01:54:03,908
TRAVIS: Is she still with one of the--?

1727
01:54:03,908 --> 01:54:05,560
LAURA: No, she's alone.

1728
01:54:08,240 --> 01:54:15,993
MATT: As you're walking and you're concentrating,
you watch as the satchel itself lifts and tugs and

1729
01:54:15,993 --> 01:54:22,437
just tugs. Her head spins around and looks behind
her, looks back.

1730
01:54:25,237 --> 01:54:26,787
SAM: I press up against the wall.

1731
01:54:28,477 --> 01:54:35,391
MATT: Glances around confused, eyes one of the
small pauper children that's off to the side,

1732
01:54:35,391 --> 01:54:37,812
begging on the side of the road--

1733
01:54:37,812 --> 01:54:39,628
ALL: Oh no.

1734
01:54:39,628 --> 01:54:40,445
SAM: It was that one.

1735
01:54:40,445 --> 01:54:44,313
MATT: Scoffs and holds her chin up and then
continues walking with a brisker pace.

1736
01:54:44,313 --> 01:54:45,985
SAM: I follow at a brisker pace.

1737
01:54:45,985 --> 01:54:47,728
MATT: Make another stealth check, please.

1738
01:54:49,828 --> 01:54:51,560
SAM: Stealth? 22.

1739
01:54:51,560 --> 01:54:52,664
LAURA: Ooh, that's good.

1740
01:54:52,664 --> 01:54:54,611
TRAVIS: Yeah, killed the baby and false
imprisonment for the kids.

1741
01:54:54,611 --> 01:54:57,338
LIAM: That's how the empire works.

1742
01:54:57,338 --> 01:55:00,860
MATT: Okay, brisker pace, but does not seemed to
take notice of your tracking.

1743
01:55:00,860 --> 01:55:04,551
SAM: I'll get a little closer this time and try
for one of the pockets this time.

1744
01:55:04,551 --> 01:55:05,342
MATT: Okay.

1745
01:55:05,342 --> 01:55:06,319
LAURA: Oh my god.

1746
01:55:09,479 --> 01:55:12,243
SAM: Ooh. 12.

1747
01:55:12,243 --> 01:55:13,446
LIAM: That's better.

1748
01:55:18,226 --> 01:55:24,302
MATT: There's a brief moment where you've watched
the flap of the blouse open up and expand a bit as

1749
01:55:24,302 --> 01:55:29,430
the Mage Hand begins to reach in for what is
within and then with a slight tug you watch as two

1750
01:55:29,430 --> 01:55:36,409
of the blouse buttons bounce off and just a bit of
the brassiere shows and she closes her shirt real

1751
01:55:36,409 --> 01:55:40,530
fast and looks about again and turns and what you
can see is a man there who's selling apples on a

1752
01:55:40,530 --> 01:55:45,766
small cart on the side, is maybe two feet from her
and goes "Miss?" With the apple and she smacks him

1753
01:55:45,766 --> 01:55:51,461
right in the face and he, "What was-- what?!" "How
dare you."

1754
01:55:51,461 --> 01:55:53,131
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

1755
01:55:53,131 --> 01:55:58,084
MATT: Then holding her shirt closed and bundles up
her satchel up in her arms and is now beelining it

1756
01:55:58,084 --> 01:55:59,190
deeper into the city.

1757
01:55:59,190 --> 01:56:00,915
TRAVIS: Don't let her get away with that.

1758
01:56:00,915 --> 01:56:04,168
SAM: I run up to where that happened and pick up
the two buttons.

1759
01:56:04,168 --> 01:56:09,372
(laughter)

1760
01:56:09,372 --> 01:56:10,789
MATT: They're nice buttons.

1761
01:56:10,789 --> 01:56:21,034
SAM: I come back. I did it! I got these two
things. They're very nice and round and shiny.

1762
01:56:21,034 --> 01:56:23,166
LIAM: They're very nice. Where did they come from?

1763
01:56:23,166 --> 01:56:29,181
SAM: A very grumpy person. She was awful. She
scowled at children and slapped an innocent man

1764
01:56:29,181 --> 01:56:33,266
for no reason. She was evil!

1765
01:56:33,266 --> 01:56:36,975
LIAM: Insight check. That is a 20.

1766
01:56:39,675 --> 01:56:42,320
MATT: If you want to insight check her, you've got
to make a deception check.

1767
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:44,434
LIAM: Well, maybe she believes it, I don't know.

1768
01:56:44,434 --> 01:56:47,516
SAM: I believe it! She was a horrible person.

1769
01:56:48,466 --> 01:56:50,583
LIAM: Yeah, okay well.

1770
01:56:51,433 --> 01:56:53,936
SAM: My itch has been scratched.

1771
01:56:55,456 --> 01:56:57,875
TALIESIN: I feel good about everything that just
happened.

1772
01:56:57,875 --> 01:57:06,292
LAURA: In the time that Nott was gone could I spot
the Allhammer temple? Just so I know where it is?

1773
01:57:06,292 --> 01:57:07,950
MATT: Make a perception check.

1774
01:57:09,170 --> 01:57:10,691
TALIESIN: Or the Platinum House.

1775
01:57:13,461 --> 01:57:14,691
LAURA: 12.

1776
01:57:20,501 --> 01:57:27,855
MATT: Unfortunately no, the Platinum House nor the
Hearth of the Allhammer were noticed. The Hearth

1777
01:57:27,855 --> 01:57:32,279
of the Allhammer is in the Pentamarket on the
northern side and you guys had cut through to get

1778
01:57:32,279 --> 01:57:38,261
directly to the vicinity of the bathhouse. In the
area you are now in the city, you don't have any

1779
01:57:38,261 --> 01:57:44,259
sort of visual on the Platinum House. As you guys
have gathered yourselves together and you make

1780
01:57:44,259 --> 01:57:51,128
your way towards The Steam's Respite, we're going
to take a break! Because it is nine o'clock.

1781
01:57:51,128 --> 01:57:53,478
LAURA and MARISHA: Nein.

1782
01:57:53,478 --> 01:57:56,514
MATT: We'll be back here in a few minutes, we'll
make this as quick of a break as we can so we can

1783
01:57:56,514 --> 01:58:00,846
jump back in. In the meantime, guys, sit tight,
we'll see you again in a few minutes.

1784
01:58:00,846 --> 01:58:03,401
ALL: Yeah!

1785
01:58:03,401 --> 02:12:46,890
[break]

1786
02:12:46,890 --> 02:12:57,329
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. Welcome back. Thank
you for your patience. Once again, you didn't miss

1787
02:12:57,592 --> 02:13:01,585
anything. Sorry, we didn't have a giveaway this
week. We hope to have one up and going real soon

1788
02:13:01,585 --> 02:13:05,213
from our folks at Wyrmwood. In the meantime, hang
tight, you didn't miss anything.

1789
02:13:05,713 --> 02:13:07,664
MARISHA: You have shit all over your arm!

1790
02:13:07,664 --> 02:13:09,083
LIAM: Oh, I pooped on myself.

1791
02:13:09,083 --> 02:13:10,493
MARISHA: Ew, you really are Caleb. What is that?

1792
02:13:10,493 --> 02:13:13,713
LIAM: That's not poop, that's where I've had this
circle.

1793
02:13:13,713 --> 02:13:14,732
MARISHA: No, that is--

1794
02:13:14,732 --> 02:13:16,096
LIAM: That's Pocky chocolate.

1795
02:13:16,096 --> 02:13:18,053
MARISHA: I'm going to dad thumb you.

1796
02:13:18,053 --> 02:13:19,688
LIAM: That's Pocky chocolate.

1797
02:13:19,688 --> 02:13:20,471
MARISHA: That's gross.

1798
02:13:20,471 --> 02:13:22,217
LIAM: It's just fecal matter, it's not like
it's--

1799
02:13:23,237 --> 02:13:32,733
MATT: Anyway, welcome back, guys. Great to have
you. You guys coast alongside the road leading

1800
02:13:32,733 --> 02:13:39,848
towards the Steam's Respite. You catch a glance at
the King's Hall. You see a massive structure of

1801
02:13:39,848 --> 02:13:45,808
bronze and cobalt that is, essentially, the
central courthouse of the city. You can see its

1802
02:13:45,808 --> 02:13:55,120
this massive, tall, single story that stands at
least 20 feet high, with long thin windows about

1803
02:13:55,120 --> 02:14:01,651
every 15 or so feet. The crownsguard presence is
pretty thick. You see probably, at first glance,

1804
02:14:01,651 --> 02:14:09,011
at least ten or so that are watching the front as
general sentries. There it is. You do also, at a

1805
02:14:09,011 --> 02:14:15,418
quick glance, see a ten-foot by five-foot large,
heavy piece of wooden board that is standing on

1806
02:14:15,418 --> 02:14:20,350
its own about four feet from the main entrance to
the right. It has a number of pieces of parchment

1807
02:14:20,350 --> 02:14:25,452
stuck to it. Are you guys continuing on? Head to
the bath house? What are you doing?

1808
02:14:25,712 --> 02:14:27,088
MARISHA: Take a gander?

1809
02:14:27,088 --> 02:14:30,935
TALIESIN: We've got Mr. Memory Board here to scan
the thing.

1810
02:14:30,935 --> 02:14:32,752
LIAM: Yeah, I just take a quick look at it.

1811
02:14:34,232 --> 02:14:36,739
LAURA: Are there people watching the board right
now?

1812
02:14:36,739 --> 02:14:41,957
MATT: Looks like there's one person scanning past
in the process of reading and looking at things as

1813
02:14:41,957 --> 02:14:50,238
they go. Looks to be a person in basic leather
armors. Probably a sellsword of some kind.

1814
02:14:50,238 --> 02:14:56,788
LAURA: As soon as he walks away, is there anybody,
any guards looking at the board?

1815
02:14:56,788 --> 02:15:03,353
MATT: Not directly reading it, but there are,
right now, four that are within a 15-foot

1816
02:15:03,353 --> 02:15:04,215
proximity of it.

1817
02:15:04,215 --> 02:15:07,120
MARISHA: That's a lot of guards.

1818
02:15:07,120 --> 02:15:09,746
LAURA: That's a lot of guards at this one board.

1819
02:15:09,746 --> 02:15:15,220
MATT: Well, the board's right at the front what is
essentially the courthouse center of the entire city.

1820
02:15:15,220 --> 02:15:17,602
TRAVIS: Are we all hanging back? I'll walk up with
Caleb.

1821
02:15:18,492 --> 02:15:19,313
TALIESIN: Works for me.

1822
02:15:19,313 --> 02:15:23,641
SAM: Is there a place I can duck away for a
second, or is there a--

1823
02:15:23,641 --> 02:15:26,543
MATT: There is away from the building, but there's
nothing--

1824
02:15:26,543 --> 02:15:32,280
SAM: I walk away from the building, cast Disguise
Self on myself and make myself look exactly like Fjord.

1825
02:15:33,450 --> 02:15:34,655
MATT: Just a shorter version.

1826
02:15:34,655 --> 02:15:37,809
MARISHA: But tiny? Oh my god.

1827
02:15:37,809 --> 02:15:41,401
SAM: I've never done this before. I've only seen
people do that, so that's what I'm going to do.

1828
02:15:41,401 --> 02:15:46,402
MATT: The height difference you can create with
Disguise Self, I believe, is it a foot?

1829
02:15:46,402 --> 02:15:47,014
SAM: Uh-huh.

1830
02:15:47,014 --> 02:15:48,957
MATT: Yeah, so you have--

1831
02:15:48,957 --> 02:15:50,136
SAM: I'm four-foot tall.

1832
02:15:50,136 --> 02:15:51,142
MATT: You're a four-foot tall Fjord.

1833
02:15:51,142 --> 02:15:52,070
TRAVIS: Fjord Junior.

1834
02:15:52,070 --> 02:15:57,634
MATT: A perfect replica of Fjord on a smaller
scale emerges from the shadows and sidles up

1835
02:15:57,634 --> 02:15:58,842
alongside you, Fjord.

1836
02:15:58,842 --> 02:16:01,071
MARISHA: It's a very focused Fjord.

1837
02:16:01,071 --> 02:16:04,085
TRAVIS: Oh wow. Like a tiny little Fiesta.

1838
02:16:06,455 --> 02:16:07,388
SAM: Howdy.

1839
02:16:09,248 --> 02:16:11,614
LIAM: Are you doing a variation of Mother's Love
right now?

1840
02:16:12,474 --> 02:16:16,335
SAM: Well, I've never used this spell before, so I
just did what you did.

1841
02:16:16,335 --> 02:16:20,912
LIAM: That's good. Mistakes that I have made,
learn from them. Keep quiet.

1842
02:16:20,912 --> 02:16:22,232
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was going to say the same.

1843
02:16:22,952 --> 02:16:23,796
SAM: (softer) Howdy.

1844
02:16:30,496 --> 02:16:38,824
MATT: As you approach the board, which you can see
has atop of it pressed into the wood the lettering

1845
02:16:38,824 --> 02:16:48,876
that say Task Board. The heavy, wooden board looks
like in immediate view of it, there are maybe

1846
02:16:48,876 --> 02:16:55,961
eight pieces of paper that are currently stapled
to it with various rusted nails that have been

1847
02:16:55,961 --> 02:17:00,727
reused, and they have been placed onto it, or have
been stuck in and then replaced into it. There's

1848
02:17:00,727 --> 02:17:06,538
probably close to 45 or 50 other rusted nails that
are stuck there and have been left that have

1849
02:17:06,538 --> 02:17:12,225
currently holding nothing to it. You do see
through a first glance, both of you, as you look

1850
02:17:12,225 --> 02:17:19,032
past them, a lot of them are looking for general
work helping construction, some are looking for

1851
02:17:19,032 --> 02:17:23,929
people that want to help reinforce buildings that
are crumbling, there are some that are looking for

1852
02:17:23,929 --> 02:17:31,571
folks that can help shoo away parts of the
Outersteads that are encroaching upon the

1853
02:17:31,571 --> 02:17:38,218
farmlands on the outside of the wall. You do see
one that says, "Seeking and paying for any

1854
02:17:38,218 --> 02:17:40,865
information on Myriad activity in the city."

1855
02:17:42,925 --> 02:17:44,569
TRAVIS: Oh shit. Cops.

1856
02:17:44,569 --> 02:17:47,073
SAM: I don't know what that is. Okay.

1857
02:17:49,283 --> 02:17:53,842
MATT: There is one that says, "Reward for
information on rebel gatherings and anti-Crown rhetoric."

1858
02:17:53,842 --> 02:17:54,969
MARISHA: Ooh.

1859
02:17:55,695 --> 02:17:57,087
MATT: There's one that says--

1860
02:17:57,087 --> 02:17:57,766
SAM: Let's do it!

1861
02:17:57,766 --> 02:18:07,627
MATT: There's another that says, "Proof of others'
worship of heretical gods paid in gold." One that

1862
02:18:07,627 --> 02:18:11,767
says, "Looking for work for the glory of our King
Bertrand. Good pay and adventurous living as a

1863
02:18:11,767 --> 02:18:17,483
soldier of the Righteous Brand. Seek Leopold
Wanstiker at the Marrow Keep."

1864
02:18:19,733 --> 02:18:20,631
SAM: What?

1865
02:18:20,631 --> 02:18:25,243
MATT: Wanstiker. Wanstiker.

1866
02:18:25,243 --> 02:18:29,577
LAURA: Can I try sleight of hand and just try to
make that into Wangstacker?

1867
02:18:29,577 --> 02:18:30,803
MATT: Yeah, go for it.

1868
02:18:32,473 --> 02:18:33,379
TALIESIN: I believe in you.

1869
02:18:33,379 --> 02:18:34,927
LIAM: So we're all up there now?

1870
02:18:36,237 --> 02:18:37,037
MATT: Apparently.

1871
02:18:38,447 --> 02:18:39,648
LAURA: It was a 12.

1872
02:18:46,248 --> 02:18:52,488
MATT: No one seems to notice as you quickly
scribble out and alter the visual to where it says

1873
02:18:53,181 --> 02:19:02,496
"Wangstacker at the Marrow Keep in the Signet
Wall," and then, "Roving beast in need of

1874
02:19:02,496 --> 02:19:04,984
extermination. Must be trained sellsword with
experience."

1875
02:19:04,984 --> 02:19:08,281
MARISHA: That's right up our alley!
Extermination!

1876
02:19:08,281 --> 02:19:09,438
LIAM: Control action.

1877
02:19:10,878 --> 02:19:17,264
MATT: There looks to be one piece of engraved
brass or bronze material on the side that says,

1878
02:19:17,264 --> 02:19:23,881
"All job inquiries to be taken to Herald of the
Hall Voloshin within."

1879
02:19:23,881 --> 02:19:25,355
MARISHA: The fucking Herald.

1880
02:19:26,215 --> 02:19:28,679
LIAM: Would you repeat that last phrase please,
DM?

1881
02:19:28,679 --> 02:19:34,701
MATT: Oh, "All job inquiries are to be taken to
Herald of the Hall--"

1882
02:19:34,701 --> 02:19:35,793
LIAM: Herald of the Hall.

1883
02:19:35,793 --> 02:19:37,274
MATT: Voloshin.

1884
02:19:37,274 --> 02:19:38,033
LIAM: Voloshin?

1885
02:19:38,033 --> 02:19:39,577
MATT: Yeah. V-O-L-O-S-H-I-N.

1886
02:19:39,577 --> 02:19:42,605
MARISHA: It's the guy the town crier said.

1887
02:19:45,695 --> 02:19:52,284
SAM: Personally, I think that we should turn in
those devious schemers and get all the gold we can.

1888
02:19:52,284 --> 02:19:59,361
TRAVIS: No, look, come on. They confided in us.
The last thing we should do is turn on that just

1889
02:19:59,361 --> 02:20:00,587
for a simple coin.

1890
02:20:00,587 --> 02:20:05,298
MARISHA: Besides, did you see how many posts on
that board were all revolved around ratting people out?

1891
02:20:05,321 --> 02:20:09,503
LIAM: Yeah, I also don't want to stick my neck
out, but anything that is a thumb in the eye of

1892
02:20:09,503 --> 02:20:10,967
the Empire, I'm all for.

1893
02:20:10,967 --> 02:20:14,957
TALIESIN: Stitches get-- eh snitches get
stitches. Stitches are just--

1894
02:20:14,957 --> 02:20:17,560
SAM AND TALIESIN: Stitches.

1895
02:20:17,560 --> 02:20:20,202
TALIESIN: Snitches get stitches-- wait--

1896
02:20:20,202 --> 02:20:22,071
MARISHA: Stitches are just stitches?

1897
02:20:22,071 --> 02:20:24,123
SAM: In the original Zimean--

1898
02:20:24,123 --> 02:20:25,998
LAURA: It makes more sense.

1899
02:20:25,998 --> 02:20:27,205
TALIESIN: One of the few.

1900
02:20:27,205 --> 02:20:29,999
TRAVIS: I personally enjoyed the last beast that
we slayed, but I think that we have plenty to

1901
02:20:29,999 --> 02:20:33,456
discuss in that warm bath you're talking about.

1902
02:20:35,236 --> 02:20:36,162
TALIESIN: It's time for a bath.

1903
02:20:36,162 --> 02:20:42,975
MARISHA: As we walk there I talk to Caleb. You
mentioned being like "Bah! Empire!"

1904
02:20:43,568 --> 02:20:45,979
LIAM: Just now or do you mean just a moment ago?

1905
02:20:45,979 --> 02:20:46,523
MARISHA: Yeah.

1906
02:20:46,523 --> 02:20:49,965
LAURA: Don't say it in the open, you guys, wait
until we're in the bath.

1907
02:20:49,965 --> 02:20:55,054
SAM: Yeah, let's just mosey onto the bath, nice,
slow, and steady.

1908
02:20:55,563 --> 02:21:00,435
TRAVIS: Can you put your thumbs in your pocket and
give a little waddle?

1909
02:21:01,133 --> 02:21:01,941
SAM: (pathetically) Hyuck, hyuck.

1910
02:21:01,941 --> 02:21:10,085
(laughing)

1911
02:21:10,085 --> 02:21:11,791
TRAVIS: You look right on, right there.

1912
02:21:11,791 --> 02:21:13,774
LIAM: He's a little tiny mosey--

1913
02:21:13,774 --> 02:21:14,840
MARISHA: It's so cute!

1914
02:21:14,840 --> 02:21:16,186
LAURA: It's tiny little Fjord!

1915
02:21:16,186 --> 02:21:18,769
TALIESIN: This is a dark mirror, man. A dark, dark
mirror.

1916
02:21:18,769 --> 02:21:20,771
TRAVIS: Give a little spit, so people know you're
coming.

1917
02:21:20,771 --> 02:21:22,121
SAM: (spitting)

1918
02:21:22,121 --> 02:21:23,282
TRAVIS: (tinging)

1919
02:21:23,282 --> 02:21:24,468
SAM: (western flute trill)

1920
02:21:24,468 --> 02:21:27,519
MATT: Which is strange because the spit actually
emerges from your sternum.

1921
02:21:27,519 --> 02:21:31,826
(laughing)

1922
02:21:32,936 --> 02:21:36,802
MATT: As you progress, you eventually find
yourself to the outside of The Steam's Respite.

1923
02:21:38,662 --> 02:21:42,695
Fairly simple looking building, of deeply
dark-stained wood slats that are all vertical

1924
02:21:42,695 --> 02:21:52,811
against heavy load-bearing columns at each major
corner, but it's fairly sizeable for its simple exterior.

1925
02:21:53,450 --> 02:21:58,671
TALIESIN: I've learned one thing in my travels:
always hit the bathhouse first. Every major town.

1926
02:22:00,221 --> 02:22:00,961
TRAVIS: Good to know.

1927
02:22:01,271 --> 02:22:02,626
LIAM: Finally, a bath.

1928
02:22:04,666 --> 02:22:08,088
MATT: You guys walk your way into the main
chamber. There's a couple benches to the right and

1929
02:22:08,088 --> 02:22:15,980
left of you. There's some small planters that have
low-light plants being kept in the area to give a

1930
02:22:15,980 --> 02:22:24,273
fresher scent. There is a small chair and a desk
set up with a clerk, an older female half-orc,

1931
02:22:24,273 --> 02:22:33,417
hunched but smiling with her hair gray, thick hair
braided up on the sides and pinned in the back

1932
02:22:33,417 --> 02:22:44,698
with a long spike of some kind with a lower jaw
that extends with two visible tusks, but a warm

1933
02:22:44,698 --> 02:22:52,376
smile amongst the rest of the nice flower dress
that she wears. As you approach, she looks up from

1934
02:22:52,376 --> 02:23:03,997
the desk. "Hello! You've come to the Respite. I am
Miss Rima. Are all of you here for a bath?"

1935
02:23:03,997 --> 02:23:05,817
LAURA: Yes, Miss Rima!

1936
02:23:08,237 --> 02:23:10,078
MATT: "Would you like individual rooms?"

1937
02:23:11,688 --> 02:23:16,305
LAURA: Oh, I think we plan on doing a lot of
stuff, so probably all together.

1938
02:23:16,305 --> 02:23:23,468
MATT: "Right, so the Common Room. It is less
expensive, but less private. For the six of you,

1939
02:23:23,468 --> 02:23:27,898
for the Common Chamber, that'll run about three
silver apiece."

1940
02:23:27,898 --> 02:23:28,991
MARISHA: Oh, yeah.

1941
02:23:28,991 --> 02:23:30,246
TRAVIS: Quite reasonable.

1942
02:23:30,246 --> 02:23:36,700
LAURA: Rima, is there someone who can take
clothing and clean it up as well while we are

1943
02:23:36,700 --> 02:23:37,295
bathing?"

1944
02:23:37,295 --> 02:23:46,188
MATT: "That can be provided at an additional cost,
my dear. That'll be an additional one silver each

1945
02:23:46,188 --> 02:23:49,084
for the washing and cleaning fee."

1946
02:23:49,084 --> 02:23:50,012
TALIESIN: Oh, happily.

1947
02:23:50,012 --> 02:23:50,855
MARISHA: I'll take it.

1948
02:23:50,855 --> 02:23:52,301
LIAM: I'll pass on it.

1949
02:23:54,221 --> 02:23:55,388
LAURA: You probably shouldn't, though.

1950
02:23:57,188 --> 02:23:59,376
TRAVIS: He's all clean right now. Pumat Sol
cleaned him up.

1951
02:24:00,506 --> 02:24:02,673
LAURA: They can stitch up the holes and stuff.

1952
02:24:02,673 --> 02:24:04,260
LIAM: The clothes are still pretty shit, though.

1953
02:24:04,260 --> 02:24:06,506
LAURA: No, you were Prestidigitation-ed.

1954
02:24:08,126 --> 02:24:12,851
LIAM: My hair is killer right now. The clothes are
old and shitty.

1955
02:24:12,851 --> 02:24:15,463
MATT: The clothes are cleaner, they're just
tattered and patched.

1956
02:24:16,233 --> 02:24:17,479
LIAM: Some stink don't come off.

1957
02:24:17,479 --> 02:24:20,018
LAURA: Ew! Like the poop splatter!

1958
02:24:20,018 --> 02:24:21,729
LIAM: I meant blood, but sure.

1959
02:24:24,729 --> 02:24:26,124
LIAM: The poop is right there.

1960
02:24:26,124 --> 02:24:30,385
TALIESIN: Early 90s River Phoenix hair going
everywhere of its own volition.

1961
02:24:31,225 --> 02:24:33,079
TRAVIS: I'd like to have my clothes cleaned, yes.

1962
02:24:33,079 --> 02:24:34,761
LAURA: Four silver.

1963
02:24:34,761 --> 02:24:46,570
MATT: "Four, eight, 12, 16, 23 silver for the lot.
Thank you so much." Takes the change, leads you

1964
02:24:46,570 --> 02:24:54,286
into a back chamber where you get undressed. There
is a doorway that leads open into a central common

1965
02:24:54,286 --> 02:25:01,143
hot spring bath that is dug out of the ground
here. It has a rock perimeter to it, and the steam

1966
02:25:01,143 --> 02:25:07,537
immediately hits you. It smells of herbs and
soaps. The water itself is somewhat cloudy, and it

1967
02:25:07,537 --> 02:25:10,978
looks like there's maybe only four other people in
there, obscured by the steam at the edges of the

1968
02:25:10,978 --> 02:25:18,813
pool. As Miss Rima leaves your presence, you guys
can finish disrobing and leaving your clothing

1969
02:25:18,813 --> 02:25:20,897
behind and enter the bathhouse.

1970
02:25:22,217 --> 02:25:28,306
MARISHA: I go in, and I'm like that drunk person
at the hot tub at the hotel. Hi, how are you guys

1971
02:25:28,306 --> 02:25:33,387
doing? Excuse me! Scoot over! I got more friends
coming.

1972
02:25:33,983 --> 02:25:37,368
LAURA: I run by her and say cannonball! And jump
in.

1973
02:25:37,368 --> 02:25:38,773
MATT: (water splashing)

1974
02:25:38,773 --> 02:25:39,351
MARISHA: Told you.

1975
02:25:41,231 --> 02:25:47,611
MATT: As the explosion of water hits, there's this
older couple in their 70s or so that, as you

1976
02:25:47,611 --> 02:25:53,647
muscle in, they slowly scoot away. There's this
splash and they both (upset squealing) and avoid

1977
02:25:54,266 --> 02:25:55,056
the space.

1978
02:25:55,056 --> 02:25:56,475
TRAVIS: (elderly voice) My anniversary!

1979
02:25:58,235 --> 02:26:01,748
MATT: As you come up out of the water, Jester, and
(breathes), you hair flaps back on the back of

1980
02:26:01,748 --> 02:26:02,910
your neck.

1981
02:26:02,910 --> 02:26:04,187
LAURA: Hair like the Little Mermaid.

1982
02:26:06,257 --> 02:26:10,546
MATT: Your eyes focus, and you see a familiar face
in the water across from you. Leaning, arms

1983
02:26:10,546 --> 02:26:17,270
akimbo, against the rock, with a thick hilt of a
sword just resting, apparently--

1984
02:26:17,270 --> 02:26:18,390
TRAVIS: In the hot tub?!

1985
02:26:18,390 --> 02:26:24,368
MATT: In the hot tub. You see a familiar
pale-looking, muscular woman, with darker hair

1986
02:26:24,374 --> 02:26:28,997
that fades to light, as there is Yasha, staring at
you with a curious look.

1987
02:26:28,997 --> 02:26:34,304
(cheering)

1988
02:26:34,304 --> 02:26:35,883
MARISHA: Fresh off the east coast!

1989
02:26:35,883 --> 02:26:37,254
TRAVIS: Beast mode!

1990
02:26:38,464 --> 02:26:39,603
MATT: Scoot in a bit.

1991
02:26:39,603 --> 02:26:40,730
ASHLEY: Oh, hi!

1992
02:26:40,730 --> 02:26:46,019
ALL: Oh, hi!

1993
02:26:46,019 --> 02:26:55,720
ASHLEY: I'm here! A little sleepy, but I'm here!
Oh! Well, if it isn't my old friends.

1994
02:26:55,720 --> 02:26:56,578
MARISHA: The fuck?

1995
02:26:56,578 --> 02:26:58,542
LAURA: Oh my god, Yasha!

1996
02:26:58,542 --> 02:27:04,984
ASHLEY: You know, I've been tracking you guys for
quite some time, and I knew you were here, but I

1997
02:27:04,984 --> 02:27:11,734
just figured I might want to get a bath first and
get a rub down. Treat myself.

1998
02:27:13,204 --> 02:27:15,949
TRAVIS: Oh man. You come to these places a lot?
I've never been.

1999
02:27:18,519 --> 02:27:21,711
ASHLEY: I enjoy sometimes the finer things of
life.

2000
02:27:21,711 --> 02:27:22,970
MARISHA: She rolled with Molly.

2001
02:27:22,970 --> 02:27:28,018
TALIESIN: I walk out of the changing room and walk
by, don't even-- just give a kiss on the head.

2002
02:27:28,018 --> 02:27:29,670
Took you bloody long enough to find us.

2003
02:27:29,670 --> 02:27:32,280
ASHLEY: I know, I'm sorry. I had some things to
do.

2004
02:27:32,280 --> 02:27:34,947
TALIESIN: I'm, for the record, tattooed a lot.

2005
02:27:36,217 --> 02:27:36,941
MATT: Explain the tattoos.

2006
02:27:36,941 --> 02:27:42,349
TALIESIN: Okay. I apologize that there's no art
yet. I'll get around to that. There's a snake

2007
02:27:42,349 --> 02:27:47,487
tattoo that curls all the way up the arm. That
goes all the way up into the peacock-- people have

2008
02:27:47,487 --> 02:27:52,939
seen the top of the peacock, but the peacock is
actually roving into a big floral piece that goes down

2009
02:27:52,939 --> 02:27:58,548
into a snake that is swallowing the hand. There is
an eye in a pyramid piece with another eye

2010
02:27:58,548 --> 02:28:02,882
illuminated above it. It seems to almost go into
the hairline, all the way up the back. There's a

2011
02:28:02,882 --> 02:28:08,230
moon and sun connected to the shoulder piece that
all interconnects. The whole thing's very complicated.

2012
02:28:08,230 --> 02:28:09,800
LAURA: Is it all upper body?

2013
02:28:09,800 --> 02:28:10,675
TALIESIN: It is all upper body, yeah.

2014
02:28:10,675 --> 02:28:12,515
LAURA: What about the Prince Albert?

2015
02:28:12,515 --> 02:28:16,454
TALIESIN: Except for-- do you actually know what
that is?

2016
02:28:16,454 --> 02:28:17,022
LAURA: I do.

2017
02:28:17,022 --> 02:28:17,645
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I don't.

2018
02:28:17,645 --> 02:28:20,344
TRAVIS: She knows a lot about dicks, remember?

2019
02:28:20,804 --> 02:28:25,782
SAM: Poor Ashley. Wherever she goes, it's body
tattoos.

2020
02:28:25,782 --> 02:28:31,509
(laughter)

2021
02:28:31,509 --> 02:28:38,319
ASHLEY: I found him in the woods. In a Bag of
Holding.

2022
02:28:39,249 --> 02:28:42,071
TALIESIN: Each tattoo has 15 meanings.

2023
02:28:44,201 --> 02:28:47,228
LIAM: Have you been hot on our heels this whole
time to keep pace with us?

2024
02:28:47,844 --> 02:28:51,900
ASHLEY: You guys are not very discreet. You're
pretty easy to follow.

2025
02:28:51,900 --> 02:28:53,616
LAURA: Did you see what happened in Alfield?

2026
02:28:54,206 --> 02:28:55,049
ASHLEY: Uh, yeah.

2027
02:28:57,679 --> 02:28:59,253
LAURA: That was us. We killed them all.

2028
02:28:59,253 --> 02:29:05,202
ASHLEY: Okay. I came for the aftermath of it, but
I didn't see. Or I would have jumped in and

2029
02:29:05,202 --> 02:29:06,369
helped, of course.

2030
02:29:06,369 --> 02:29:11,728
SAM: Why are you following us? And by the way,
even though I am totally naked, I still look like--

2031
02:29:11,728 --> 02:29:17,507
MATT: A fully clothed, tiny Fjord. Yeah. Even when
you remove your clothing, they just shed off your

2032
02:29:17,507 --> 02:29:20,556
body and they still visually appear on you. It's a
very strange visual.

2033
02:29:21,486 --> 02:29:23,213
SAM: It's me, the goblin, by the way.

2034
02:29:23,213 --> 02:29:25,902
ASHLEY: Oh. I do remember you quite well.

2035
02:29:26,492 --> 02:29:28,343
SAM: Why were you following us?

2036
02:29:28,713 --> 02:29:33,063
ASHLEY: I said I was going to meet you here in
Zadash.

2037
02:29:33,063 --> 02:29:34,772
LAURA: We told her where we were going to go.

2038
02:29:34,772 --> 02:29:38,819
SAM: Oh. But don't you have mysterious big person
things to do?

2039
02:29:38,819 --> 02:29:42,004
ASHLEY: I did. I have things that I occasionally
tend to, and I did.

2040
02:29:42,004 --> 02:29:43,297
SAM: Did you do them?

2041
02:29:44,697 --> 02:29:45,405
ASHLEY: Ish.

2042
02:29:47,475 --> 02:29:49,322
SAM: (whispering) So mysterious.

2043
02:29:49,322 --> 02:29:53,408
ASHLEY: It's not that mysterious. I just have
things that I have to do sometimes.

2044
02:29:53,718 --> 02:29:55,418
TRAVIS: We're looking to get in some--

2045
02:29:55,418 --> 02:29:56,438
ASHLEY: Trouble?

2046
02:29:56,438 --> 02:29:57,261
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2047
02:29:57,261 --> 02:29:59,601
TALIESIN: They paid us 60 gold for three days.

2048
02:29:59,601 --> 02:30:01,617
ASHLEY: You made 60 gold in three days?

2049
02:30:01,617 --> 02:30:03,232
LAURA: We killed things for money!

2050
02:30:03,232 --> 02:30:04,769
TALIESIN: I've never made money like this.

2051
02:30:04,769 --> 02:30:07,839
TRAVIS: We've got the head of a manticore out on
our cart. Melting in the sun.

2052
02:30:07,839 --> 02:30:09,348
SAM: I stole two buttons!

2053
02:30:11,728 --> 02:30:16,469
ASHLEY: Oh. How nice! What do they look like,
these buttons?

2054
02:30:17,709 --> 02:30:21,311
SAM: They're in my existing clothes.

2055
02:30:21,311 --> 02:30:22,572
ASHLEY: Your other clothing?

2056
02:30:22,572 --> 02:30:24,647
SAM: They're in the other room. They're very nice,
though.

2057
02:30:24,647 --> 02:30:27,751
ASHLEY; You're among friends. You don't have to
wear any clothes if you don't want.

2058
02:30:27,751 --> 02:30:28,998
SAM: No, I'm okay.

2059
02:30:32,428 --> 02:30:35,453
LAURA: Oh, are you free of bandages and everything
too and we just can't see it?

2060
02:30:35,453 --> 02:30:37,953
SAM: Yeah, I handed all of those bandages to be
washed.

2061
02:30:37,953 --> 02:30:41,882
(laughter)

2062
02:30:41,882 --> 02:30:50,953
ASHLEY: I did hear that you've been calling
yourselves something? I hear a name floating

2063
02:30:50,953 --> 02:30:55,950
around, that you're calling yourselves the Mighty
Nein?

2064
02:30:56,480 --> 02:30:57,147
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

2065
02:30:57,147 --> 02:30:58,948
MARISHA: We are getting a reputation!

2066
02:30:58,948 --> 02:31:03,158
TALIESIN: Word of mouth. You don't need a big,
public thing.

2067
02:31:03,158 --> 02:31:05,372
TRAVIS: Not too much, Caleb. It's all right. Not
too much.

2068
02:31:05,372 --> 02:31:06,916
LIAM: How many people have you heard that from?

2069
02:31:06,916 --> 02:31:08,574
ASHLEY: Three and a half.

2070
02:31:09,924 --> 02:31:11,469
TRAVIS: That's less than a handful.

2071
02:31:11,469 --> 02:31:12,678
TALIESIN: Three and one dead.

2072
02:31:12,678 --> 02:31:14,536
TRAVIS: Not even worth mentioning at all.

2073
02:31:14,536 --> 02:31:15,768
LIAM: In a handful of days.

2074
02:31:17,218 --> 02:31:18,366
ASHLEY: In a handful of days.

2075
02:31:18,366 --> 02:31:23,545
SAM: And is our reputation intimidating?
Threatening?

2076
02:31:26,045 --> 02:31:36,761
ASHLEY: It's neither here nor there, but just for
clarification, is it Nine, as the number nine--

2077
02:31:36,761 --> 02:31:38,346
SAM: Yes. It's the number nine.

2078
02:31:38,346 --> 02:31:40,381
TRAVIS: Actually, that's not correct.

2079
02:31:40,381 --> 02:31:41,432
LAURA: So we still need a few people left.

2080
02:31:41,432 --> 02:31:41,977
ASHLEY: Okay.

2081
02:31:41,977 --> 02:31:44,199
TALIESIN: It's going to be very hard to search for
us if they don't know if it's Nine or Nein.

2082
02:31:44,199 --> 02:31:46,200
SAM: No, it's Nine, the number nine.

2083
02:31:46,200 --> 02:31:48,783
MARISHA: It's deliberately con-- are they looking
for nine people?

2084
02:31:48,783 --> 02:31:49,651
SAM: That's right.

2085
02:31:49,651 --> 02:31:51,048
ASHLEY: You look different.

2086
02:31:51,048 --> 02:31:52,260
TRAVIS: I thought it was "no."

2087
02:31:54,450 --> 02:31:59,156
LIAM: Yes. I have been in this bath for a few
minutes. No, you were here when I got here. That's

2088
02:31:59,156 --> 02:32:07,451
true. We visited an arcane shop and the
gentle...men? I'm not sure, really. The

2089
02:32:07,997 --> 02:32:12,992
proprietors of the shop did a little dippity doo
to me and it just took everything away.

2090
02:32:12,992 --> 02:32:14,733
LAURA: Did you know there's a spell that can do
that?

2091
02:32:14,733 --> 02:32:20,002
ASHLEY: No. I actually don't know much about
spells and things.

2092
02:32:20,002 --> 02:32:23,832
LIAM: Yeah, he gave me the carwash. Took it all
away.

2093
02:32:23,832 --> 02:32:25,353
ASHLEY: Nice.

2094
02:32:26,443 --> 02:32:28,559
MARISHA: That's something different from where I
come from.

2095
02:32:28,559 --> 02:32:34,943
LIAM: Yeah, I don't like this. I start sinking
into the bath, enveloping everything, and sitting

2096
02:32:34,943 --> 02:32:36,749
on the bottom and holding my breath for a little
while.

2097
02:32:36,749 --> 02:32:41,134
TRAVIS: Well, we've lost Caleb. Should we discuss
the potential job offers that we've collected?

2098
02:32:41,134 --> 02:32:44,441
TALIESIN: Also, if we're going to get him back, we
going to have to have an agreement about the fact

2099
02:32:44,441 --> 02:32:48,059
that, while there's going to be a certain amount
of advertising necessary for this kind of venture,

2100
02:32:48,059 --> 02:32:55,511
there are many of us-- and I think it's fair to
say-- that want to keep things quiet. As quiet as possible.

2101
02:32:55,511 --> 02:32:58,384
TRAVIS: I agree. I am also not looking to attract
any attention.

2102
02:32:59,124 --> 02:33:04,747
MATT: (clapping) You hear this four series of
quick snapping claps, and you hear, "Heat it up!"

2103
02:33:04,747 --> 02:33:10,501
You hear the voice of Miss Rima from within, and
you watch as two side doors open. These small

2104
02:33:10,501 --> 02:33:16,424
troops of women and men come through with these
pots of heated water, and then dump them into the

2105
02:33:16,424 --> 02:33:20,344
bath to refresh the heat, and then exit again and
then close the doors behind them.

2106
02:33:20,344 --> 02:33:21,079
TALIESIN: Bless you!

2107
02:33:21,469 --> 02:33:23,371
LIAM: Oh, it's hot down there on the ears!

2108
02:33:23,371 --> 02:33:26,017
MARISHA: Yeah. I wasn't going to tell you.

2109
02:33:27,717 --> 02:33:29,467
SAM: I'm not in the water.

2110
02:33:29,467 --> 02:33:30,430
LAURA: You're not getting in the water?

2111
02:33:30,430 --> 02:33:31,036
SAM: Nope.

2112
02:33:31,036 --> 02:33:33,022
LAURA: You're just standing off to the side,
Nott?

2113
02:33:33,022 --> 02:33:33,468
SAM: Yep.

2114
02:33:33,468 --> 02:33:34,777
LAURA: But you're naked.

2115
02:33:35,717 --> 02:33:36,770
SAM: Possibly, yes.

2116
02:33:36,770 --> 02:33:39,043
LAURA: You're ready to come in. Come into the--

2117
02:33:39,043 --> 02:33:40,668
ASHLEY: Have you been in the water at all?

2118
02:33:40,668 --> 02:33:44,238
SAM: No, I'd prefer not to.

2119
02:33:44,498 --> 02:33:46,776
ASHLEY: Do you not like going into the water?

2120
02:33:46,776 --> 02:33:47,587
SAM: No, thank you.

2121
02:33:47,587 --> 02:33:49,082
LAURA: What is it about it?

2122
02:33:49,082 --> 02:33:53,995
SAM: It's creepy. It's dangerous in there. It can
drown a person.

2123
02:33:53,995 --> 02:33:59,963
MARISHA: So wait. You're creeped out by water and
you're creeped out by fire? Man, covering the

2124
02:33:59,963 --> 02:34:03,169
spectrums. Yeah.

2125
02:34:03,169 --> 02:34:04,072
LAURA: Yeah.

2126
02:34:04,892 --> 02:34:07,524
ASHLEY: Nott, do you know how to swim?

2127
02:34:07,524 --> 02:34:10,234
SAM: I don't know. I haven't tried in a while.

2128
02:34:10,234 --> 02:34:12,209
TRAVIS: Well, we can certainly teach you.

2129
02:34:12,209 --> 02:34:13,739
ASHLEY: We could hold you.

2130
02:34:13,739 --> 02:34:16,995
TRAVIS: Yeah. It's very shallow here. Very little
risk.

2131
02:34:16,995 --> 02:34:19,815
TALIESIN: My father just threw me right in. That's
how I learned.

2132
02:34:19,815 --> 02:34:21,106
MARISHA: You know, that's actually--

2133
02:34:21,106 --> 02:34:22,573
TRAVIS: We're not going to do that.

2134
02:34:22,573 --> 02:34:23,563
TALIESIN: No, that's a terrible idea.

2135
02:34:23,563 --> 02:34:25,066
SAM: No, that sounds terrifying and horrible!

2136
02:34:25,066 --> 02:34:26,526
TALIESIN: It was awful, but here we are.

2137
02:34:26,526 --> 02:34:29,106
LIAM: I could hold you and you could do the dog
paddle. Have you ever seen the dog paddle before?

2138
02:34:29,106 --> 02:34:32,856
SAM: I mean, it seems dangerous, though. How do
you breathe in there?

2139
02:34:32,856 --> 02:34:34,048
MARISHA: Well, you keep your head above water.

2140
02:34:34,048 --> 02:34:35,080
LIAM: Well, you know.

2141
02:34:36,750 --> 02:34:43,333
MARISHA: Here, I take Nott and I say, hold my
hands. Just hold my hands. Okay, ready? And I pull

2142
02:34:43,333 --> 02:34:50,952
Nott into the water and I go: Now kick kick kick!
There you go! Kick kick kick! Keep kicking! Keep

2143
02:34:50,952 --> 02:34:55,275
kicking! Good job! And I put her back on the
edge.

2144
02:34:55,275 --> 02:34:57,486
SAM: (coughing) It got in my nose!

2145
02:34:57,486 --> 02:34:58,664
TALIESIN: Wow, that brought it back.

2146
02:34:58,664 --> 02:34:59,842
TRAVIS: She vomits up a popsicle into the pool.

2147
02:34:59,842 --> 02:35:01,204
MARISHA: It's okay. See?

2148
02:35:06,184 --> 02:35:07,262
LAURA: See? How did it feel?

2149
02:35:08,492 --> 02:35:09,583
SAM: It wasn't terrible.

2150
02:35:09,583 --> 02:35:12,224
LIAM: Does the little Fjord look wet or dry?

2151
02:35:12,224 --> 02:35:16,686
MATT: Looks dry. But leaving a trail of water
behind.

2152
02:35:16,686 --> 02:35:18,030
LIAM: I love magic so much.

2153
02:35:18,030 --> 02:35:19,082
SAM: It's not bad.

2154
02:35:19,712 --> 02:35:22,484
LAURA: Are the old couple looking at us like we're
weird?

2155
02:35:22,484 --> 02:35:27,679
MATT: Yes. They're both off, holding each other,
just going.

2156
02:35:27,679 --> 02:35:30,856
LIAM: Hey, they're all about to start having sex.
You might want to get out of here.

2157
02:35:30,856 --> 02:35:34,151
MATT: They immediately get up and start leaving
into the changing room, exiting the chamber.

2158
02:35:34,151 --> 02:35:36,735
LAURA: Is there anyone else in this pool with us?

2159
02:35:36,735 --> 02:35:37,576
MATT: At the moment, no.

2160
02:35:37,576 --> 02:35:38,137
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2161
02:35:38,137 --> 02:35:40,795
LAURA: Yeah! It's all ours! It's a party room
now!

2162
02:35:40,795 --> 02:35:42,442
TALIESIN: I don't think they understood that was
an invitation.

2163
02:35:43,462 --> 02:35:48,506
TRAVIS: So here's what we got. We got "gold from
'My-riad' activity?"

2164
02:35:50,716 --> 02:35:51,398
LAURA: Myriad.

2165
02:35:51,398 --> 02:35:53,734
TRAVIS: Myriad activity. Whatever that is.

2166
02:35:53,734 --> 02:35:54,419
TALIESIN: That's exciting.

2167
02:35:54,419 --> 02:36:01,276
TRAVIS: We got "reward for rebel gatherings."
Which we are not going to do. We've got "tracking

2168
02:36:01,276 --> 02:36:04,678
down heretical god worship." I don't think we're
feeling that one, right?

2169
02:36:04,678 --> 02:36:05,718
LIAM: With this one?

2170
02:36:05,718 --> 02:36:07,610
LAURA: Probably a bad thing to do!

2171
02:36:09,190 --> 02:36:17,126
SAM: Do you have a god that you worship? Because
we've just been told that's it's bad juju around here.

2172
02:36:17,126 --> 02:36:20,107
TRAVIS: Yeah. Apparently there are only six
deities they allow to be worshipped publicly here.

2173
02:36:20,107 --> 02:36:22,113
ASHLEY: What are the six deities?

2174
02:36:22,113 --> 02:36:25,179
TRAVIS: The Allhammer, the Raven Queen, the--

2175
02:36:25,179 --> 02:36:26,723
LAURA: Platinum Dragon.

2176
02:36:26,723 --> 02:36:30,572
SAM: The Dawnfather, the Annoying Mistress?

2177
02:36:30,572 --> 02:36:31,616
MATT: The Knowing Mis--

2178
02:36:31,616 --> 02:36:36,213
(laughter)

2179
02:36:36,213 --> 02:36:38,092
MATT: That's a different pantheon all together.

2180
02:36:39,232 --> 02:36:44,099
MARISHA: What was it? The Dawnfather, the Raven
Queen, the Knowing Mistress, the Allhammer--

2181
02:36:44,099 --> 02:36:45,863
MATT: The Lawbearer.

2182
02:36:45,863 --> 02:36:47,277
MARISHA: The Lawbearer!

2183
02:36:47,277 --> 02:36:52,155
LIAM: Do you have any sort of religion or
tradition of heavy metal or something?

2184
02:36:54,865 --> 02:36:56,223
ASHLEY: Yes, I do.

2185
02:36:59,213 --> 02:37:00,583
SAM: Are you in the clear?

2186
02:37:01,423 --> 02:37:02,321
ASHLEY: Not here.

2187
02:37:02,321 --> 02:37:05,859
LAURA: (gasps) Do you worship the Traveler too?

2188
02:37:05,859 --> 02:37:07,459
ASHLEY: I do not.

2189
02:37:07,459 --> 02:37:10,732
LAURA: Oh, okay. I thought I would have known you
if you did.

2190
02:37:10,732 --> 02:37:11,299
ASHLEY: Probably.

2191
02:37:11,299 --> 02:37:14,559
LAURA: We have really small group meetings. It's
usually just me.

2192
02:37:14,559 --> 02:37:26,291
ASHLEY: Oh. He sounds like a great-- so many
adventures. With traveling and with him.

2193
02:37:26,491 --> 02:37:27,438
LAURA: What about you?

2194
02:37:32,238 --> 02:37:39,468
ASHLEY: Well, I don't feel like I'm comfortable to
say here--

2195
02:37:39,468 --> 02:37:40,962
SAM: We can see your vagina.

2196
02:37:40,962 --> 02:37:43,899
LAURA: Yeah, you don't have anything to hide from
us.

2197
02:37:43,899 --> 02:37:45,376
ASHLEY: I mean, it's underwater, but--

2198
02:37:45,376 --> 02:37:46,315
SAM: So we're all comfortable.

2199
02:37:46,315 --> 02:37:50,080
TALIESIN: One assumes there's a mist that's just
covering everything--

2200
02:37:50,080 --> 02:37:52,708
MATT: It obscures it to the point where, yeah.

2201
02:37:54,998 --> 02:37:56,437
ASHLEY: You stand up and it's still like--

2202
02:37:58,477 --> 02:38:01,891
TALIESIN: I mean, nudity's going great and all,
but this is more about comfortability.

2203
02:38:01,891 --> 02:38:05,691
LIAM: As a victim of Campaign One: yes, there has
to be.

2204
02:38:07,701 --> 02:38:09,054
LAURA: Everything is a milk bath.

2205
02:38:09,054 --> 02:38:10,309
TALIESIN: Thank you!

2206
02:38:11,499 --> 02:38:13,033
LIAM: That's not milk!

2207
02:38:15,193 --> 02:38:23,076
TRAVIS: We also got, apparently, Winestacker. Wang
stacker? Yeah, he had something, at the Morrow Keep?

2208
02:38:23,076 --> 02:38:25,610
LAURA: He wanted people to join the military, so
no.

2209
02:38:25,610 --> 02:38:30,003
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're not going to do that. But
there is a roving beast, which feel like falls

2210
02:38:30,003 --> 02:38:30,938
into our wheelhouse.

2211
02:38:31,938 --> 02:38:33,994
LAURA: I like killing roving beasts.

2212
02:38:33,994 --> 02:38:37,511
TALIESIN: I don't know what a wheelhouse is, but I
feel pretty positive about the metaphor in general.

2213
02:38:37,511 --> 02:38:43,978
LAURA: Nott, do you want me to wash your hair for
you? No one will see. Because you look like Fjord.

2214
02:38:44,700 --> 02:38:46,168
SAM: All right, that'll be nice!

2215
02:38:46,168 --> 02:38:52,726
TRAVIS: If you're not planning on bouncing tout
suite, might be a fair way to find our way in the town.

2216
02:38:53,762 --> 02:39:00,370
ASHLEY: Sometimes I have to go, but I like killing
things, so sign me up.

2217
02:39:00,966 --> 02:39:02,034
TALIESIN: My god, the money.

2218
02:39:02,034 --> 02:39:03,477
ASHLEY: And my god, the money.

2219
02:39:03,477 --> 02:39:04,998
TALIESIN: I've never seen anything like it.

2220
02:39:04,998 --> 02:39:06,804
LAURA: We made so much money off of ears!

2221
02:39:06,804 --> 02:39:07,854
TRAVIS: Yep, we really did.

2222
02:39:07,854 --> 02:39:08,606
ASHLEY: Just ears alone?

2223
02:39:08,606 --> 02:39:10,242
TALIESIN: Three months' worth of shows, like
that!

2224
02:39:10,242 --> 02:39:10,871
ASHLEY: Wow.

2225
02:39:10,871 --> 02:39:12,907
MARISHA: The Crownsguard have so much money.

2226
02:39:12,907 --> 02:39:15,135
TALIESIN: And they're so lazy!

2227
02:39:15,135 --> 02:39:20,076
LAURA: And we're going to make a whole lot of
gold over at the Pillow Trove.

2228
02:39:20,076 --> 02:39:22,110
ASHLEY: What is the Pillow Trove?

2229
02:39:22,619 --> 02:39:25,120
LAURA: It's a fancy hotel place.

2230
02:39:25,120 --> 02:39:28,274
TRAVIS: Apparently Jester's mother's going to hook
it up, right?

2231
02:39:28,274 --> 02:39:28,884
LAURA: Mm-hmm!

2232
02:39:28,884 --> 02:39:30,217
ASHLEY: Who's your mother?

2233
02:39:30,217 --> 02:39:32,022
LAURA: She's the Ruby of the Sea.

2234
02:39:32,022 --> 02:39:34,780
ASHLEY: I feel like I've heard of the Ruby of the
Sea.

2235
02:39:38,260 --> 02:39:41,482
ASHLEY and TALIESIN: [whisper inaudibly]

2236
02:39:41,482 --> 02:39:46,264
ASHLEY: Okay, I have heard of the Ruby of the Sea.
That's pretty spectacular that that's your mother.

2237
02:39:46,264 --> 02:39:47,252
LAURA: I know!

2238
02:39:47,252 --> 02:39:48,802
MARISHA: She has her own jingle.

2239
02:39:51,252 --> 02:39:58,732
SAM: How does that go again? (singing) Everybody
knows the Ruby of the Sea!

2240
02:40:00,742 --> 02:40:03,250
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (singing) The best lay
around!

2241
02:40:05,470 --> 02:40:08,608
LAURA: You guys have really bad memories because
it was not like this at all.

2242
02:40:08,608 --> 02:40:14,388
TRAVIS: Hey, Nott, now the next step is to get
your head underwater. Okay, we're going to take a

2243
02:40:14,388 --> 02:40:14,953
big breath.

2244
02:40:15,433 --> 02:40:18,304
LAURA: I've been sudsing up your hair. You have to
do it to dunk your hair.

2245
02:40:18,304 --> 02:40:19,626
SAM: To wash my hair?

2246
02:40:19,626 --> 02:40:22,897
TRAVIS: Beau and I will hold you, and on the count
of three, we're going to go under.

2247
02:40:22,897 --> 02:40:25,550
TRAVIS and MARISHA: One, and a two, and a three!

2248
02:40:26,710 --> 02:40:28,376
TRAVIS: We all go underwater with Nott.

2249
02:40:28,376 --> 02:40:30,831
TRAVIS, MARISHA, and SAM: (bubbling)

2250
02:40:30,831 --> 02:40:32,443
TRAVIS: And we bring him back up.

2251
02:40:32,443 --> 02:40:35,288
SAM: (gasping) I'll kill you all! I'll kill every
motherfucking one!

2252
02:40:37,518 --> 02:40:39,011
TRAVIS: (shushing)

2253
02:40:39,011 --> 02:40:41,438
LIAM: He's done, you are with friends.

2254
02:40:41,438 --> 02:40:47,178
TRAVIS: Hey, you did great! You did great. You're
going to get a sticker.

2255
02:40:48,478 --> 02:40:54,808
MARISHA: A sucker, at the end of this. From
Jester, not from me, but you'll get a sucker.

2256
02:40:54,808 --> 02:40:57,091
TRAVIS: It didn't burn, right? You lived. Great
job.

2257
02:40:57,091 --> 02:40:57,680
SAM: Thank you.

2258
02:40:57,680 --> 02:40:59,840
ASHLEY: How do you feel now? Are you still
scared?

2259
02:41:00,730 --> 02:41:08,211
SAM: I'm less scared, but it's still
uncomfortable, and I'd prefer to do it at my own

2260
02:41:08,211 --> 02:41:09,963
speed, thank you very much.

2261
02:41:11,213 --> 02:41:14,521
ASHLEY: Do you want to stand at the side then, and
hold the side?

2262
02:41:15,251 --> 02:41:18,475
SAM: Hold the side, like this? Yes.

2263
02:41:24,475 --> 02:41:32,472
LIAM: Yasha, there's a heavier presence of the
Empire here than there was in Trostenwald. How

2264
02:41:32,472 --> 02:41:33,481
does that sit with you?

2265
02:41:36,221 --> 02:41:46,005
ASHLEY: Well, I know I have to be careful about
some certain things. I think I'll be fine.

2266
02:41:47,495 --> 02:41:51,691
TRAVIS: Nobody's chasing after you or giving you
any heat, are they?

2267
02:41:51,691 --> 02:41:52,249
ASHLEY: No.

2268
02:41:52,249 --> 02:41:53,125
LIAM: Insight check.

2269
02:41:57,485 --> 02:42:00,785
TRAVIS: Which one? I am lying!

2270
02:42:02,495 --> 02:42:05,947
MATT: Generally you can say, "Do I believe her?"
and then I'll tell you to make an insight check.

2271
02:42:05,947 --> 02:42:10,264
LIAM: Okay. Do I believe her? I do! Okay.

2272
02:42:16,494 --> 02:42:24,761
ASHLEY: I'm not in trouble for anything. I think,
if anything, it would be because of the god I've

2273
02:42:24,761 --> 02:42:25,589
chosen to follow.

2274
02:42:25,589 --> 02:42:27,352
LAURA: Which is whom?

2275
02:42:27,352 --> 02:42:27,880
TRAVIS: Jester!

2276
02:42:34,480 --> 02:42:38,200
ASHLEY: It's the Stormlord. I don't know if you
know of him.

2277
02:42:38,200 --> 02:42:39,621
SAM: Do any of us know what the Stormlord is?

2278
02:42:41,481 --> 02:42:45,080
MATT: Yeah. For basic religion, you would, because
you've been outside the Empire. Those of you who

2279
02:42:45,080 --> 02:42:48,686
grew up in the Empire, you would vaguely have an
idea.

2280
02:42:48,686 --> 02:42:49,960
LIAM: What about a big reader?

2281
02:42:49,960 --> 02:42:51,657
MATT: You would, maybe. Make a religion check.

2282
02:42:52,687 --> 02:42:53,557
LIAM: Natural 20.

2283
02:42:55,197 --> 02:43:01,655
MATT: You are very aware of the Stormlord. You
knew the Stormlord well. Since the Menagerie Coast

2284
02:43:01,655 --> 02:43:07,992
largely relies on port trade, it is one of the
most-worshipped gods in the Menagerie Coast for

2285
02:43:07,992 --> 02:43:14,422
people who travel in and out of the ports there.
Overseas, safe passage amongst bodies of water,

2286
02:43:14,422 --> 02:43:20,575
contests of strength, proving worth through
action. Lot of very interesting elements that the

2287
02:43:20,575 --> 02:43:23,800
two of you would know of that following.

2288
02:43:24,210 --> 02:43:27,304
TRAVIS: I understand the Stormlord is to be feared
and respected.

2289
02:43:27,304 --> 02:43:39,241
ASHLEY: Yes, he's pulled me out of what literally
felt like the depths of hell, so I owe him my

2290
02:43:39,241 --> 02:43:49,578
life. I will continue to serve him and do as he
asks, whenever he asks.

2291
02:43:49,578 --> 02:43:52,137
LAURA: Are you from the Menagerie Coast as well?

2292
02:43:52,857 --> 02:43:53,549
ASHLEY: No.

2293
02:43:53,549 --> 02:43:55,602
LAURA: Are you from the empire?

2294
02:43:56,222 --> 02:43:56,897
ASHLEY: No.

2295
02:43:58,237 --> 02:43:59,552
SAM: Where are you from?!

2296
02:43:59,552 --> 02:44:03,254
(laughter)

2297
02:44:03,254 --> 02:44:07,019
LAURA: Sorry, Yasha. This is a lot. If you don't
want to answer, I understand.

2298
02:44:07,019 --> 02:44:10,272
LIAM: Yeah, you just joined back up with us. She
doesn't need to tell us her life story.

2299
02:44:10,722 --> 02:44:13,244
MARISHA: When you say "pulled you from hell,"
though--

2300
02:44:13,244 --> 02:44:14,397
TRAVIS: Wow, Beau. Really?

2301
02:44:14,397 --> 02:44:17,422
MARISHA: What? She brought it up.

2302
02:44:17,422 --> 02:44:20,530
LIAM: You are literally undercutting the very
thing I just said.

2303
02:44:20,530 --> 02:44:22,784
TRAVIS: We are very glad that you're back.

2304
02:44:22,784 --> 02:44:24,659
TALIESIN: I vouch for her, for what it's worth.

2305
02:44:24,659 --> 02:44:26,294
TRAVIS: Which means a lot, Molly.

2306
02:44:26,294 --> 02:44:27,720
TALIESIN: It means what it means.

2307
02:44:27,720 --> 02:44:29,203
LAURA: I trust her fully.

2308
02:44:31,233 --> 02:44:36,071
TRAVIS: Molly, what else do you do around a hot
bath-spa-place?

2309
02:44:36,071 --> 02:44:39,794
TALIESIN: You run into your friends who are also
heading in odd directions.

2310
02:44:39,794 --> 02:44:44,610
LAURA: You stand uncomfortably close to people you
know and make them feel awkward. And I walk really

2311
02:44:44,610 --> 02:44:45,822
close to you, Fjord.

2312
02:44:49,232 --> 02:44:52,834
TALIESIN: I tend to find it's easier to look into
somebody's eyes and figure out if they're lying to

2313
02:44:52,834 --> 02:44:55,994
you if they're naked and boiling.

2314
02:44:55,994 --> 02:45:07,597
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. Jester-- I forgot what I was going
to say.

2315
02:45:09,247 --> 02:45:14,406
MARISHA: Yasha, it's interesting to see you
without your cloak. You were super adamant about

2316
02:45:14,406 --> 02:45:14,980
that one.

2317
02:45:16,890 --> 02:45:17,767
ASHLEY: I was cold.

2318
02:45:17,767 --> 02:45:21,805
MARISHA: Sure. Hot tub, you know.

2319
02:45:22,455 --> 02:45:25,379
ASHLEY: I recall when you asked for it, it was a
very cold day.

2320
02:45:29,229 --> 02:45:34,463
MARISHA: Uh-huh. Do you need a towel? Do you need
me to get the hard-to-reach places in your back or

2321
02:45:34,463 --> 02:45:35,689
anything for you, while we're here?

2322
02:45:35,689 --> 02:45:36,628
ASHLEY: I got it.

2323
02:45:36,628 --> 02:45:40,038
TALIESIN: I like to think you're scratching--
You've got a sword in your hand, for god's sake.

2324
02:45:40,038 --> 02:45:41,575
TRAVIS: This is normal, right?

2325
02:45:41,575 --> 02:45:43,194
ASHLEY: You pay extra to keep your weapons.

2326
02:45:44,244 --> 02:45:46,612
SAM: You've been in the water before, haven't
you?

2327
02:45:46,612 --> 02:45:50,475
TRAVIS: No, I know, it just seems to be happening
faster than before. It's all fragrant and stuff.

2328
02:45:50,475 --> 02:45:53,211
LAURA: Oh no, Fjord! Are you melting?!

2329
02:45:53,211 --> 02:45:54,552
SAM: He's turning into a fish!

2330
02:45:54,552 --> 02:45:56,754
LAURA: Oh no, you're turning into water!

2331
02:45:56,754 --> 02:46:03,940
TRAVIS: Oh no, oh no. Jester, help. (fake drowning
noises)

2332
02:46:03,940 --> 02:46:08,913
LIAM: Five or six days in, I think, and I'm really
questioning this decision.

2333
02:46:12,463 --> 02:46:15,574
SAM: Should we take the mission to go kill the big
beast?

2334
02:46:15,974 --> 02:46:16,859
TRAVIS: I think so.

2335
02:46:16,859 --> 02:46:23,026
TALIESIN: I say we take the beast. Again, keep it
on the down-low. We'll figure out a way of getting

2336
02:46:23,026 --> 02:46:29,093
credit and keeping our reputation, but keeping it
quiet.

2337
02:46:29,093 --> 02:46:30,939
MARISHA and LAURA: Okay.

2338
02:46:33,179 --> 02:46:34,761
TRAVIS: We take it to the Herald of the Hall.

2339
02:46:34,761 --> 02:46:35,633
LAURA: Yes.

2340
02:46:35,633 --> 02:46:37,525
TALIESIN: God, I hope his name is Harold.

2341
02:46:37,525 --> 02:46:47,398
MARISHA: You guys know how Shakäste was all like
(shushing) and secret, you know?

2342
02:46:47,398 --> 02:46:48,864
LAURA: Is that what he was like?

2343
02:46:48,864 --> 02:46:51,827
MARISHA: Yeah, he was all like, "I'm mysterious."

2344
02:46:51,827 --> 02:46:55,791
TRAVIS: We met a guy named Shakäste, he was super
cool. White afro, really awesome.

2345
02:46:55,791 --> 02:46:57,274
MARISHA: Have you heard of him?

2346
02:46:57,274 --> 02:46:58,198
LIAM: Totally blind.

2347
02:46:58,198 --> 02:47:02,478
MARISHA: Everywhere he went, he was like,
(shushing). He was super badass.

2348
02:47:02,478 --> 02:47:03,471
TRAVIS: He said "baby" a lot.

2349
02:47:03,471 --> 02:47:04,331
LAURA: He called us "baby."

2350
02:47:04,331 --> 02:47:06,261
ASHLEY: He called you a baby a lot?

2351
02:47:06,261 --> 02:47:07,920
TRAVIS: But in a charming way.

2352
02:47:08,930 --> 02:47:15,748
MARISHA: I was into it, I didn't feel demeaned by
it. It makes me feel good, makes me feel safe.

2353
02:47:15,748 --> 02:47:17,521
TALIESIN: I felt demeaned, but in a good way.

2354
02:47:18,731 --> 02:47:20,379
MARISHA: I'm just saying, maybe we can--

2355
02:47:20,379 --> 02:47:22,550
MARISHA and LAURA: Be like that.

2356
02:47:24,700 --> 02:47:28,258
LAURA: I get out and I start drying my hair and
try to get pretty.

2357
02:47:28,888 --> 02:47:29,850
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're up.

2358
02:47:30,430 --> 02:47:34,846
MATT: You guys start making your way out of the
bath, gathering your clothing once more, as you

2359
02:47:34,846 --> 02:47:35,400
head back.

2360
02:47:35,400 --> 02:47:37,143
TRAVIS: I gather my clothing away from Jester.

2361
02:47:37,143 --> 02:47:41,523
LIAM: Is this one still in disguise? Nott, are you
still in disguise?

2362
02:47:41,523 --> 02:47:42,817
SAM: How long has it been?

2363
02:47:42,817 --> 02:47:44,541
LIAM: It's an hour, that it takes.

2364
02:47:47,181 --> 02:47:51,516
MATT: You've been in here, catching up and soaking
for about a half an hour, 40 minutes, so you're

2365
02:47:51,516 --> 02:47:52,647
getting pretty close to losing.

2366
02:47:52,647 --> 02:47:57,366
SAM: I wrap a towel around myself, and then I'll
drop form.

2367
02:47:57,366 --> 02:47:58,542
TRAVIS: Come on, "son."

2368
02:47:59,922 --> 02:48:06,938
MATT: You now see the towel-covered, goblinoid
form of Nott, her hair wet and tattered down

2369
02:48:06,938 --> 02:48:10,931
across the face. It's long in the front, the
yellow eyes peeking through.

2370
02:48:11,721 --> 02:48:14,984
LIAM: Are our clothes in here, or somewhere else?

2371
02:48:14,984 --> 02:48:16,822
LAURA: They probably folded them up for us.

2372
02:48:16,822 --> 02:48:19,140
LIAM: But I didn't send mine off to be cleaned.

2373
02:48:19,140 --> 02:48:20,560
TALIESIN: Then yours was in a locker.

2374
02:48:20,560 --> 02:48:25,221
LIAM: I'm going to pull the spool of silver thread
and I'll take a length of it out, and I'm going to

2375
02:48:25,221 --> 02:48:28,379
pull Nott's hair back and do a little ponytail.
Simple.

2376
02:48:30,509 --> 02:48:32,029
ASHLEY: I'm going to wait until everyone gets
out.

2377
02:48:32,739 --> 02:48:37,970
MARISHA: Damn it. I was going to say, I wait and
watch all my friends get out.

2378
02:48:37,970 --> 02:48:40,758
TRAVIS: You all just sit on opposite sides.

2379
02:48:43,458 --> 02:48:44,401
SAM: You guys coming?

2380
02:48:44,401 --> 02:48:45,615
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

2381
02:48:45,615 --> 02:48:49,147
ASHLEY: Yeah, I just want to make sure that I get
my full time's worth.

2382
02:48:49,147 --> 02:48:51,068
MARISHA: Yeah, we paid a lot for this.

2383
02:48:53,498 --> 02:48:56,409
TRAVIS: Should we catch you outside, then?

2384
02:48:57,049 --> 02:48:57,973
MARISHA: No, it's good.

2385
02:49:00,223 --> 02:49:01,677
TALIESIN: It's a really hot hot tub.

2386
02:49:03,487 --> 02:49:06,525
LIAM: I think the moment's passed for the rest of
us. I think we should go.

2387
02:49:06,525 --> 02:49:07,653
SAM: We'll just go.

2388
02:49:07,653 --> 02:49:09,907
TRAVIS: Maybe they need more hot water, we'll send
some in on our way out.

2389
02:49:11,227 --> 02:49:12,884
LIAM: Have fun storming the castle.

2390
02:49:13,464 --> 02:49:18,113
MATT: The clean clothing is presented. You guys
get dressed and your outfits are waiting for you

2391
02:49:18,113 --> 02:49:19,896
in the dressing room.

2392
02:49:23,226 --> 02:49:24,769
TALIESIN: I'm ready for Monster Hunter.

2393
02:49:24,769 --> 02:49:26,092
LAURA: Who gives up first?

2394
02:49:26,092 --> 02:49:28,160
TRAVIS: I'm real down for that showdown.

2395
02:49:28,160 --> 02:49:29,439
MARISHA: We're in hot tub chicken right now.

2396
02:49:31,229 --> 02:49:33,332
ASHLEY: I mean, I don't care to show anything.

2397
02:49:34,012 --> 02:49:34,531
MARISHA: No?

2398
02:49:37,461 --> 02:49:41,397
ASHLEY: I feel like this is a pool of honesty. I
just wanted to see everybody else naked first.

2399
02:49:41,397 --> 02:49:44,230
MARISHA: Yeah, it's honestly kind of my thing.

2400
02:49:44,230 --> 02:49:46,370
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm getting out.

2401
02:49:46,370 --> 02:49:48,159
LIAM: And the water drops a foot and a half.

2402
02:49:48,159 --> 02:49:52,367
(laughter)

2403
02:49:52,367 --> 02:49:57,003
MATT: It's fun to watch her make her way out using
the large greatsword essentially as a walking

2404
02:49:57,003 --> 02:50:00,617
stick as she emerges from the tub.

2405
02:50:00,617 --> 02:50:01,906
MARISHA: Do I get a nice view?

2406
02:50:04,216 --> 02:50:05,067
MATT and ASHLEY: Yes.

2407
02:50:05,067 --> 02:50:06,978
SAM: Roll for perv.

2408
02:50:08,468 --> 02:50:10,169
TRAVIS: Perving on Yasha.

2409
02:50:14,229 --> 02:50:15,755
MARISHA: And now I get out, yeah.

2410
02:50:16,475 --> 02:50:17,226
TALIESIN: Backflip.

2411
02:50:19,436 --> 02:50:20,277
MARISHA: Three-point landing.

2412
02:50:23,467 --> 02:50:30,319
MATT: You guys have regathered your materials.
You've reconvened outside the Steam's Respite.

2413
02:50:30,319 --> 02:50:35,524
It's about midday now, about noon-ish. The rest of
the day is still yours. What do you wish to do?

2414
02:50:35,524 --> 02:50:38,812
TALIESIN: Let's find a herald. The maudlin
herald.

2415
02:50:38,812 --> 02:50:41,284
LAURA: While you guys do that, I need to go to The
Pillow Trove, okay?

2416
02:50:41,284 --> 02:50:42,504
LIAM: Where are you going?

2417
02:50:42,504 --> 02:50:48,073
LAURA: I need to go to The Pillow Trove, which is
the nice tavern in the place.

2418
02:50:48,073 --> 02:50:52,379
LIAM: Would you mind, I don't want to go in, but
would you mind if I tagged along with you?

2419
02:50:52,379 --> 02:50:53,625
LAURA: No, that's fine.

2420
02:50:53,625 --> 02:50:56,683
TRAVIS: Will you be gone for a while, or is it a
quick errand?

2421
02:50:56,683 --> 02:50:59,792
LAURA: It's a quick errand. I just need to pop in
and pop out, you know how you do.

2422
02:50:59,792 --> 02:51:01,969
TRAVIS: We'll see you back over here, then? Okay.

2423
02:51:03,229 --> 02:51:07,744
LIAM: Nott, did you want to stick with the others?
I'm going to run an errand with Jester.

2424
02:51:07,744 --> 02:51:08,825
SAM: Do you need me?

2425
02:51:10,205 --> 02:51:12,830
LIAM: Not for this. I should just be gone a couple
of hours.

2426
02:51:12,830 --> 02:51:16,221
SAM: Do you need health potions, because you might
die?

2427
02:51:18,251 --> 02:51:19,866
LIAM: I think chances are very low.

2428
02:51:19,866 --> 02:51:21,212
SAM: Do you have one?

2429
02:51:21,212 --> 02:51:23,576
LIAM: Yeah, I have the one you secured for me,
yeah.

2430
02:51:23,576 --> 02:51:24,386
SAM: Okay, good.

2431
02:51:24,386 --> 02:51:27,803
TALIESIN: Come on, Nott, it'll be fine. We'll see
if we can meet anybody else who you could make

2432
02:51:27,803 --> 02:51:29,236
feel better about who they are.

2433
02:51:29,236 --> 02:51:32,090
LIAM: Go have fun. Maybe you get another button or
two from a grumpy person.

2434
02:51:32,090 --> 02:51:32,692
SAM: Excellent.

2435
02:51:34,212 --> 02:51:38,180
LAURA: Before we leave, I run up and give Yasha a
hug, and say: I'm glad you're back.

2436
02:51:38,180 --> 02:51:48,566
ASHLEY: Oh, thank you, Jester. I get
uncomfortable. I don't hug her back, but I gently

2437
02:51:48,566 --> 02:51:50,479
give her one pat.

2438
02:51:52,479 --> 02:51:56,290
LIAM: Caleb sees this, and just goes--

2439
02:51:57,660 --> 02:51:59,810
TRAVIS: Hug around the arms that are down, and
you're like--

2440
02:52:02,220 --> 02:52:02,851
MATT: Perfect.

2441
02:52:03,671 --> 02:52:06,998
ASHLEY: I'm trying. I'm very uncomfortable with
human touch.

2442
02:52:06,998 --> 02:52:08,636
LIAM: I feel like I know you better now.

2443
02:52:09,666 --> 02:52:11,606
TRAVIS: We'll see you back at the King's Hall.

2444
02:52:11,606 --> 02:52:12,577
LAURA: Okie-dokie.

2445
02:52:15,497 --> 02:52:18,813
MATT: Those of you heading to the King's Hall, you
make your way back to the familiar outside, this

2446
02:52:18,813 --> 02:52:30,904
large center for law, order, and judgement within
the city of Zadash. As you approach the doorways,

2447
02:52:30,904 --> 02:52:37,242
the guards pass, but keep an eye very closely as
you enter. On the interior, you can see there are

2448
02:52:37,242 --> 02:52:45,354
two round tables with curved benches that meet the
sides of it, and there you can see some of the

2449
02:52:45,354 --> 02:52:50,207
crownsguard in the process of talking to various
civilians and taking notes. There's conversation

2450
02:52:50,207 --> 02:52:54,100
about-- pardon me. So?

2451
02:52:54,100 --> 02:52:58,521
TRAVIS: Is there a desk, or a clerk?

2452
02:52:59,231 --> 02:53:02,120
MATT: You don't see a desk or a clerk, but you do
see the crownsguard that are currently at the

2453
02:53:02,120 --> 02:53:05,679
tables, talking to these individuals, and you see
two other individual crownsguards that are

2454
02:53:05,679 --> 02:53:11,285
standing and guarding two hallway entrances that
lead further into the King's Hall.

2455
02:53:11,285 --> 02:53:17,258
MARISHA: As we walk up, I'm going to take my robe,
and for the first time any time this party has

2456
02:53:17,258 --> 02:53:22,860
seen, cross it over and tie it more
traditionally.

2457
02:53:24,460 --> 02:53:29,515
TRAVIS: I'll walk up to one of the king's guard,
ask him. We're here to inquire about one of the

2458
02:53:29,515 --> 02:53:34,193
postings. There's a roving beast that needs taking
care of.

2459
02:53:35,223 --> 02:53:41,248
MATT: "Oh, let me go and get the Herald for you,
hold on just a second." He scoots out of the next

2460
02:53:41,248 --> 02:53:51,622
hallway. A few moments later, you watch as this
really stressed-looking male dwarf with these

2461
02:53:51,622 --> 02:53:59,286
thick mutton chops and salt-and-pepper hair,
well-groomed, combed really heavily to one side,

2462
02:53:59,286 --> 02:54:03,142
the thick hair is being tamed to the point where,
in a very Gene Wilder way, it's combed and then

2463
02:54:03,142 --> 02:54:12,127
(poof), out one side. As he walks in, he's wearing
long robes of gold and white and silver, and

2464
02:54:12,127 --> 02:54:18,267
carries the holy symbol of the Lawbearer. You can
see an axe that hangs on a chain with a scale

2465
02:54:18,267 --> 02:54:30,910
embedded in the center of it. He walks in. "Right.
So you're inquiring about the job board?"

2466
02:54:30,910 --> 02:54:36,030
TRAVIS: That's right. We're a few members of the
group known as the Mighty Nein. We would like to

2467
02:54:36,030 --> 02:54:38,572
take one of those listings off your hand, if we
could.

2468
02:54:38,572 --> 02:54:41,479
MATT: "All right. Which one in the task board you
looking for?"

2469
02:54:41,479 --> 02:54:45,632
TRAVIS: The one mentioning that roving beast.
Seems about our speed.

2470
02:54:46,492 --> 02:54:53,822
MATT: He gives a quick glance over all of you.
"All right. Let me go ahead and pull this out." He

2471
02:54:53,822 --> 02:54:58,816
pulls a small side bag that has a bunch of pieces
of paper in it. He unfurls one section, sets it

2472
02:54:58,816 --> 02:55:00,411
down. "And your names?"

2473
02:55:02,711 --> 02:55:05,526
MARISHA: Can't we all go under The Mighty Nein?

2474
02:55:06,706 --> 02:55:11,064
MATT: "I'm sorry, but for the purposes of
maintaining organization within the paperwork here

2475
02:55:11,064 --> 02:55:15,575
we need to know the names of those who are to
claim any rewards or benefits of completing a job."

2476
02:55:15,594 --> 02:55:17,195
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm Philbin.

2477
02:55:17,195 --> 02:55:19,523
MATT: "Philbin, all right. And you are?"

2478
02:55:19,523 --> 02:55:20,594
LIAM: Regis.

2479
02:55:23,474 --> 02:55:25,230
MARISHA: Damn it, I can't say it now.

2480
02:55:25,230 --> 02:55:26,356
TRAVIS: Yeah, fucker.

2481
02:55:27,216 --> 02:55:27,886
MARISHA: Lawrence.

2482
02:55:28,476 --> 02:55:29,463
MATT: "Lawrence."

2483
02:55:30,493 --> 02:55:31,500
SAM: Kylre.

2484
02:55:33,710 --> 02:55:34,598
MATT: "Kylre."

2485
02:55:37,208 --> 02:55:37,896
TALIESIN: Esma.

2486
02:55:39,206 --> 02:55:40,611
MATT: "Esma, all right."

2487
02:55:43,191 --> 02:55:44,803
ASHLEY: Um. Barry.

2488
02:55:44,803 --> 02:55:50,050
(laughter)

2489
02:55:50,050 --> 02:55:51,421
TALIESIN: Short for Barrymore.

2490
02:55:52,241 --> 02:55:55,847
ASHLEY: It's short for Barrymore, but I just go by
Barry.

2491
02:55:57,477 --> 02:55:59,021
MATT: Make a deception check.

2492
02:56:00,221 --> 02:56:02,139
TRAVIS: The head-shake afterward is the best

2493
02:56:06,689 --> 02:56:12,684
ASHLEY: Oh! D&D Beyond! Am I remembering how to do
this?

2494
02:56:12,684 --> 02:56:14,447
SAM: What screen are you on?

2495
02:56:18,217 --> 02:56:19,023
ASHLEY: I'm still new.

2496
02:56:19,723 --> 02:56:22,047
SAM: Refreshing! What did you roll?

2497
02:56:22,047 --> 02:56:23,428
ASHLEY: Refreshing, it's loading.

2498
02:56:24,477 --> 02:56:27,469
MARISHA: Ashley, that's DocuSign, you're in the
wrong app completely!

2499
02:56:27,469 --> 02:56:30,058
TALIESIN: Really, oh wow, that's a number.

2500
02:56:30,058 --> 02:56:31,809
ASHLEY: Okay, 13.

2501
02:56:31,809 --> 02:56:33,145
MATT: Okay.

2502
02:56:33,145 --> 02:56:34,307
TRAVIS: Is it a minus?

2503
02:56:34,307 --> 02:56:35,626
TALIESIN: It's a minus two.

2504
02:56:36,736 --> 02:56:44,671
MATT: "All right, Barry. Okay (clears throat).
This here is a writ of Lawmaster intent. This will

2505
02:56:44,671 --> 02:56:51,170
"give you entrance to the location of where the job
is supposed to take place. This supposed creature

2506
02:56:51,170 --> 02:57:00,094
"has holed up in a sewer nexus right on where the
Interstead Sprawl meets with the outer wall of the

2507
02:57:00,094 --> 02:57:07,797
"Tri-Spires. We need you to travel down there, and,
well, let's say there's a whole region on the

2508

"inside where we've been hearing about this backing
up of various liquid and strange noises from

2509
02:57:12,840 --> 02:57:17,610
"cleaners who were making their way through, so we
sent a few crownsguards down and came across a

2510
02:57:17,610 --> 02:57:25,643
"mass of congealed sewage slime and webbing, so the
fucking cowards ran back and we need to dig

2511
02:57:25,643 --> 02:57:32,405
"deeper. So here we are: find a way of whatever is
creating this disturbance, kill it, take it back

2512
02:57:32,405 --> 02:57:37,111
"with proof of the kill, whatever built that little
nest, and the Crown is willing to drop you about

2513
02:57:37,111 --> 02:57:38,557
"700 gold pieces."

2514
02:57:39,467 --> 02:57:40,490
TALIESIN: 700 gold pieces?

2515
02:57:40,490 --> 02:57:41,795
MATT: "That's correct."

2516
02:57:42,495 --> 02:57:46,351
TALIESIN: Just for the entrance, they are aware
that there are several of us, we are just

2517
02:57:46,351 --> 02:57:48,399
representatives of a slightly larger group.

2518
02:57:48,399 --> 02:57:51,312
MATT: "Well, you have to divide it evenly from the
700 you get."

2519
02:57:51,312 --> 02:57:53,900
TALIESIN: Of course, but we can all get entrance
from this writ?

2520
02:57:53,900 --> 02:57:55,779
MATT: "All the ones that are named on here."

2521
02:57:55,779 --> 02:57:57,471
TALIESIN: You need all the names of everybody
involved?

2522
02:57:58,461 --> 02:57:59,735
MATT: "There's more involved?"

2523
02:57:59,735 --> 02:58:01,318
TALIESIN: Well, we're called the Mighty "Nine,"
aren't we?

2524
02:58:03,238 --> 02:58:08,312
MATT: (groans) Takes the writ. "And who are the
other companions?"

2525
02:58:08,312 --> 02:58:10,397
TALIESIN: Well, let's just send seven of us down
for now.

2526
02:58:10,397 --> 02:58:11,918
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's fair.

2527
02:58:11,918 --> 02:58:13,642
SAM: Seven of nine?

2528
02:58:14,232 --> 02:58:24,101
TALIESIN: Oh, really? I've never felt such hatred
than this moment. Wow, god damn it.

2529
02:58:24,471 --> 02:58:26,503
TRAVIS: What are those other two called? I
forget.

2530
02:58:27,493 --> 02:58:29,152
ASHLEY: We've got Karen--

2531
02:58:29,152 --> 02:58:30,867
TRAVIS: (laughing) Karen.

2532
02:58:31,457 --> 02:58:32,560
SAM: And Rothschild.

2533
02:58:33,690 --> 02:58:35,658
MATT: "Karen and Rothschild."

2534
02:58:35,658 --> 02:58:44,066
ASHLEY: Yeah. Wouldn't that mean we would get 900
gold? 100 per person-- per, you know?

2535
02:58:44,066 --> 02:58:47,187
MATT: "No, that would be 700 gold, split between
the lot of you."

2536
02:58:47,187 --> 02:58:52,530
TRAVIS: Just to be clear, there's no clearage of
sewage? We're just here to take care of whatever's

2537
02:58:52,530 --> 02:58:55,099
causing that webbing you mentioned.

2538
02:58:55,099 --> 02:58:59,168
MATT: "Whatever's causing the blockage, and the
webbing, whatever else they found down there. Yes,

2539
02:58:59,168 --> 02:59:01,265
"take care of that, bring back proof of the
death."

2540
02:59:02,245 --> 02:59:03,683
TRAVIS: Proof of-- okay.

2541
02:59:03,683 --> 02:59:05,821
MARISHA: But you don't know what did it?

2542
02:59:05,821 --> 02:59:07,441
SAM: Do you know what kind of monster it is?

2543
02:59:07,441 --> 02:59:09,485
MATT: "No fucking clue, that's why you're being
paid 700 gold for it!"

2544
02:59:11,725 --> 02:59:13,177
SAM: Okay. Have people been killed?

2545
02:59:14,737 --> 02:59:19,712
MATT: "People have gone missing. You think you're
the first to try and take the job? No, it's

2546
02:59:19,712 --> 02:59:24,001
"dangerous! That's why we're paying so much. If you
don't want it, go away. If you want it, here's the

2547
02:59:24,001 --> 02:59:25,272
"writ, good luck."

2548
02:59:25,962 --> 02:59:26,795
MARISHA: Thank you.

2549
02:59:26,795 --> 02:59:30,251
TRAVIS: Mighty obliged, we'll take care of this
most expediently.

2550
02:59:30,251 --> 02:59:31,346
MARISHA: Bye.

2551
02:59:31,346 --> 02:59:33,257
ASHLEY: Wait! Has anyone gone and come back?

2552
02:59:33,257 --> 02:59:41,226
MATT: "There have been three times that it's been
taken up and one's come back declining it and two

2553
02:59:41,226 --> 02:59:42,861
"that have not."

2554
02:59:43,681 --> 02:59:47,444
TRAVIS: Declining it? For any specific reason or
did they just change their mind?

2555
02:59:48,424 --> 02:59:49,834
MATT: "Think they changed their mind a bit."

2556
02:59:51,224 --> 02:59:52,217
ASHLEY: We'll take care of it.

2557
02:59:53,247 --> 02:59:54,570
MATT: "I'm sure you will."

2558
02:59:56,490 --> 02:59:58,688
ASHLEY: I sense a little sarcasm in you, sir.

2559
03:00:00,158 --> 03:00:03,177
MATT: "It's a dwarven thing. We've got resting
bitch voice."

2560
03:00:03,177 --> 03:00:06,627
(laughter)

2561
03:00:06,627 --> 03:00:07,840
ASHLEY: Fair enough.

2562
03:00:07,840 --> 03:00:09,788
TRAVIS: Good day to you. We'll take care of this.

2563
03:00:10,478 --> 03:00:13,331
MATT: "Great. Well, shove off!"

2564
03:00:13,331 --> 03:00:14,298
SAM: Okay!

2565
03:00:14,298 --> 03:00:15,527
TRAVIS: And we leave.

2566
03:00:15,697 --> 03:00:16,924
TALIESIN: We walk away.

2567
03:00:16,924 --> 03:00:18,099
MATT: All right.

2568
03:00:21,199 --> 03:00:22,149
MARISHA: Theoretically.

2569
03:00:22,459 --> 03:00:23,286
TRAVIS: Yeah?

2570
03:00:24,246 --> 03:00:28,405
MARISHA: Not that I want to be a-- what's the
word-- "shysta"?

2571
03:00:29,195 --> 03:00:29,921
LIAM: Shyster.

2572
03:00:29,921 --> 03:00:32,614
SAM and TRAVIS: Shakäste.

2573
03:00:33,724 --> 03:00:39,858
MARISHA: If they don't know what the monster is,
and we have a perfectly good manticore head--

2574
03:00:39,858 --> 03:00:41,958
TALIESIN: Then they're going to send people down
there.

2575
03:00:41,958 --> 03:00:43,520
TRAVIS: That's not really our problem.

2576
03:00:43,520 --> 03:00:44,834
TALIESIN: But then they'll know.

2577
03:00:45,474 --> 03:00:46,854
MARISHA: If we get the gold first.

2578
03:00:46,854 --> 03:00:48,403
ASHLEY: Maybe it came back to life?

2579
03:00:49,503 --> 03:00:54,490
TALIESIN: As someone who actually has towns that
they can't re-enter again for reasons, that we

2580
03:00:54,490 --> 03:01:01,600
will go into later, over booze-- it's best to keep
a clear reputation.

2581
03:01:01,600 --> 03:01:04,706
TRAVIS: Beau does have a good point, though. I
mean, if we get down there and it's some

2582
03:01:04,706 --> 03:01:06,144
world-ending monster--

2583
03:01:06,684 --> 03:01:07,903
TALIESIN: We can just run back up.

2584
03:01:08,453 --> 03:01:12,030
MARISHA: We found a manticore, who knows, they
make nests.

2585
03:01:12,500 --> 03:01:14,059
TALIESIN: There's a blacksmith who knows.

2586
03:01:15,479 --> 03:01:19,318
MARISHA: Do you think the blacksmith cares what
the Empire is doing? The blacksmith is just trying

2587
03:01:19,318 --> 03:01:20,209
to survive.

2588
03:01:20,209 --> 03:01:25,098
TALIESIN: I think the blacksmith will get ten gold
for telling them if they find out there was a

2589
03:01:25,098 --> 03:01:26,403
manticore down there that--

2590
03:01:27,253 --> 03:01:28,577
MARISHA: If the blacksmith knows.

2591
03:01:31,447 --> 03:01:33,099
SAM: It's a good plan B.

2592
03:01:33,099 --> 03:01:36,028
TALIESIN: It's an emergency plan. It's a good plan
B, I'll grant you that.

2593
03:01:36,718 --> 03:01:42,274
TRAVIS: I head to the outside and wait out by the
posting where we last saw Caleb and Jester.

2594
03:01:42,724 --> 03:01:44,061
SAM: Karen and Rothschild.

2595
03:01:44,061 --> 03:01:46,882
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Karen and Rothschild.

2596
03:01:46,882 --> 03:01:48,296
TALIESIN: I'm going to juggle.

2597
03:01:49,716 --> 03:01:54,833
MATT: After asking some questions and making your
way around you eventually find the Tri-Spires,

2598
03:01:54,833 --> 03:01:58,859
which is not too difficult to see once you know
what you're looking for. You see these three very

2599
03:01:58,859 --> 03:02:07,406
unique-looking towers that ascend past a round
wall that encases the interior of this elite

2600
03:02:07,406 --> 03:02:13,977
portion of the city. As you approach the wall--
the outer walls you see are basic stonework and

2601
03:02:13,977 --> 03:02:18,346
masonry, thick as they may be and used as from a
defensive position-- these walls are made of solid

2602
03:02:18,346 --> 03:02:29,607
marble, and look more decorative than designed to
be a military buttress of any kind. As you

2603
03:02:29,607 --> 03:02:36,236
approach, you can see there are two entrances to
it-- or at least you've been told there are two.

2604
03:02:36,236 --> 03:02:42,433
The one that's nearest to you opens in the
direction of the Pentamarket, and while the

2605
03:02:42,433 --> 03:02:46,583
portcullis is lifted you see there are two
crownsguard there, currently standing with spears

2606
03:02:46,583 --> 03:02:54,845
and shields at the ready. A horse-drawn carriage
clomps by you and makes its way inside. You guys

2607
03:02:54,845 --> 03:02:59,094
approach and one of the guards steps forward. "Can
I help you, please?"

2608
03:02:59,444 --> 03:03:01,649
LAURA: Yes, we have business at the Pillow Trove.

2609
03:03:05,479 --> 03:03:07,542
MATT: "I don't think you do. Please, shove off."

2610
03:03:07,542 --> 03:03:11,992
LAURA: Oh, well, I have business at the Pillow
Trove.

2611
03:03:15,742 --> 03:03:17,850
MATT: "What's your business with the Pillow
Trove?"

2612
03:03:17,850 --> 03:03:22,722
LAURA: I have a package that's being delivered
there. What business do you have at the Pillow Trove?

2613
03:03:25,252 --> 03:03:28,408
MATT: "Look, your friend here looks like he just
wandered out of the Evening Nip if anything, so it

2614
03:03:28,408 --> 03:03:29,297
would be best--"

2615
03:03:29,297 --> 03:03:35,214
LAURA: Oh, yes, I hired him to protect me because
you know I'm very fragile and delicate, but if he

2616
03:03:35,214 --> 03:03:42,363
doesn't look well enough to be my guard, you're
welcome to walk me instead.

2617
03:03:43,493 --> 03:03:46,216
MATT: They look at each other. Make a persuasion
check.

2618
03:03:47,476 --> 03:03:49,694
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Come on!

2619
03:03:49,694 --> 03:03:52,694
(exclamation of surprise)

2620
03:03:52,694 --> 03:03:53,412
LAURA: 22!

2621
03:03:55,212 --> 03:03:56,013
TALIESIN: That was impressive.

2622
03:03:56,013 --> 03:04:00,466
MATT: Look at each other, look back at you. "All
right, I'll walk you in. Briefly. Then I'll get

2623
03:04:00,466 --> 03:04:02,870
back to my post. You, stay the fuck out of this."

2624
03:04:02,870 --> 03:04:07,370
LAURA: (whispering) Sorry, Caleb. I'll let you know 
what it's like, okay?

2625
03:04:08,470 --> 03:04:09,775
MARISHA: Rejected!

2626
03:04:09,775 --> 03:04:12,527
LAURA: (whispering) Frumpkin, kitty, kitty.

2627
03:04:13,467 --> 03:04:19,252
MATT: "All right, to the Pillow Trove. This way,
follow me." The other guard steps past him and

2628
03:04:19,252 --> 03:04:27,654
blocks you from the other two. As the guard guides
you in he makes a big whistle sound, does a finger

2629
03:04:27,654 --> 03:04:31,343
loop, and you watch as another guard gets relieved
and comes down to help him at the front doorway.

2630
03:04:31,343 --> 03:04:34,039
LAURA: You guys are really on top of your shit in
here.

2631
03:04:35,719 --> 03:04:41,086
MATT: "Thank you. I appreciate that." Now,
stepping into the Tri-Spires--

2632
03:04:41,086 --> 03:04:43,888
LIAM: Does that happen lickety-split, the second
guard comes down?

2633
03:04:43,888 --> 03:04:51,505
MATT: There's maybe a 20 second period where he's
making his way down. You get the sense from the

2634
03:04:51,505 --> 03:05:00,334
look of this, and glancing through the interior,
you see elements of beautiful courtyard parks with

2635
03:05:00,334 --> 03:05:08,638
trees and bushes. You can see statuesque
structures that decorate what normally was just

2636
03:05:09,092 --> 03:05:13,301
dirt road with occasional bits of stonework, as
beautifully laid cobblestone from the interior,

2637
03:05:13,301 --> 03:05:19,402
you can see homesteads of different styles of
construction from all across this continent and

2638
03:05:19,402 --> 03:05:25,924
beyond. This is where the money in the city goes.
This is the district where the elite live, where

2639
03:05:25,924 --> 03:05:32,834
the elite work, and where folk of very specific
visual presentation and purpose are allowed entry.

2640
03:05:33,234 --> 03:05:37,537
LIAM: Right, and as she goes and does her thing, I
just want you to know that Frumpkin does follow

2641
03:05:37,537 --> 03:05:43,285
her, and I leave and walk around the block, and
duck into an alley, or any private place, and cast

2642
03:05:43,285 --> 03:05:48,229
Disguise Self on myself to make myself look very
resplendent.

2643
03:05:48,729 --> 03:05:51,619
MATT: Roll a stealth check for Frumpkin.

2644
03:05:51,619 --> 03:05:57,041
LIAM: For Frumpkin? It's not very good. That is
only a four.

2645
03:05:58,681 --> 03:06:04,004
MATT: As Frumpkin begins to (meowing) run on its
way, and one of the guards goes, "Piss off," and

2646
03:06:04,004 --> 03:06:08,570
kicks Frumpkin about ten feet off, and stumbles
and skids, and then gets back up.

2647
03:06:08,570 --> 03:06:10,153
MARISHA: No! Not okay!

2648
03:06:10,153 --> 03:06:11,773
LIAM: Does that take any damage?

2649
03:06:11,773 --> 03:06:12,652
MATT: I'd say take one point of damage.

2650
03:06:12,652 --> 03:06:13,459
LIAM: Gone.

2651
03:06:13,459 --> 03:06:15,871
LAURA: No, you said one point?

2652
03:06:15,871 --> 03:06:19,111
LIAM: I rolled hit points for him when I made him,
and it was one, so he's gone.

2653
03:06:20,711 --> 03:06:22,205
TRAVIS: (explosion)

2654
03:06:22,205 --> 03:06:24,451
MARISHA: You kicked his cat into oblivion!

2655
03:06:24,451 --> 03:06:26,606
TRAVIS: You kicked his cat until it burst!

2656
03:06:26,606 --> 03:06:27,471
MATT: I didn't.

2657
03:06:27,471 --> 03:06:28,759
TRAVIS: He kicked his cat so hard!

2658
03:06:28,759 --> 03:06:33,139
TRAVIS and LAURA: He kicked the highlights out of
his hair!

2659
03:06:33,139 --> 03:06:36,411
LIAM: Who's laughing now, Billy? Who's laughing
now?

2660
03:06:38,721 --> 03:06:41,422
MATT: Stray cats can't just wander into--

2661
03:06:41,422 --> 03:06:46,468
LIAM: Caleb curses to himself and wanders around,
and does what he says, suddenly looking very

2662
03:06:46,468 --> 03:06:49,736
noble. I'll let that go and then I'll follow up.

2663
03:06:49,736 --> 03:06:53,927
TRAVIS: You guys, I kicked this cat today, and it
fucking evaporated.

2664
03:06:53,927 --> 03:06:56,060
(laughter)

2665
03:06:56,060 --> 03:06:59,199
TALIESIN: If that isn't a beer-worthy story, I
don't know what is.

2666
03:07:00,239 --> 03:07:01,970
TRAVIS: Somebody punch me. (punching sound)

2667
03:07:02,730 --> 03:07:04,730
LIAM: Caleb is pissed.

2668
03:07:05,930 --> 03:07:12,558
MATT: The guard looks a bit confused. As you
wander back, he's pointing at the tip of his boot,

2669
03:07:12,558 --> 03:07:18,701
and he's like, "I don't know, it was fucking
crazy." So what do you look like?

2670
03:07:18,701 --> 03:07:26,179
LIAM: I am wearing the deepest black robes, and I
have a black goatee. Very Evil David Hasselhoff.

2671
03:07:27,469 --> 03:07:29,201
TALIESIN: The Master from Doctor Who.

2672
03:07:29,201 --> 03:07:30,006
LIAM: Sure, that.

2673
03:07:30,006 --> 03:07:32,083
LAURA: He looks very embroidered and everything.

2674
03:07:32,083 --> 03:07:39,107
LIAM: It's all black velvet. The way the audience
thinks Vax looks, that's what I look like right now.

2675
03:07:39,677 --> 03:07:41,874
SAM: Kneel before Zod.

2676
03:07:46,462 --> 03:07:51,967
LIAM: I have a meeting in 20 minutes at the Pillow
Inn. I don't know what it's called, but Caleb

2677
03:07:51,967 --> 03:07:58,678
does. I don't remember shit, but Caleb says
whatever the name of it is, because of my feat.

2678
03:07:58,678 --> 03:08:01,637
TALIESIN: This is the smartest feat you've ever
taken.

2679
03:08:02,507 --> 03:08:06,547
LIAM: Of course it is, it was chosen very
specifically. I say whatever it's called--

2680
03:08:06,547 --> 03:08:07,365
MATT: The Pillow Trove.

2681
03:08:09,485 --> 03:08:16,208
LIAM: I don't remember, he does. I have a meeting
in 20 minutes at the Pillow Grove-- I know that's

2682
03:08:16,208 --> 03:08:20,782
wrong-- Right now, 20 minutes, I need to get in.

2683
03:08:23,212 --> 03:08:28,175
MATT: They both blink their eyes at you. As you
glance down to look at your hand, it's your

2684
03:08:28,175 --> 03:08:28,692
regular sleeve.

2685
03:08:32,452 --> 03:08:33,742
LIAM: The spell didn't work here?

2686
03:08:33,742 --> 03:08:37,135
MATT: It worked, but then as you approached, you
looked down and it's no longer there.

2687
03:08:37,135 --> 03:08:39,596
(gasping)

2688
03:08:39,596 --> 03:08:41,500
MARISHA: Oh, magic shit.

2689
03:08:42,470 --> 03:08:50,111
MATT: You have a sense now, you think back to the
air of magical longevity the spell would maintain,

2690
03:08:50,111 --> 03:08:51,200
it's gone.

2691
03:08:51,200 --> 03:08:52,042
LIAM: Oh, wow.

2692
03:08:52,042 --> 03:08:53,549
SAM: Oh no.

2693
03:08:53,549 --> 03:08:54,383
TRAVIS: Disguise Self?

2694
03:08:55,503 --> 03:08:56,736
LIAM: Yeah, he used Disguise Self.

2695
03:08:57,716 --> 03:08:58,801
LAURA: So they dispelled it?

2696
03:08:59,491 --> 03:09:00,345
LIAM: We don't know.

2697
03:09:01,495 --> 03:09:06,336
MATT: At some point, as you approached and then
walked up to the gate, your Disguise Self just

2698
03:09:06,336 --> 03:09:10,490
dissipated. The one guard that was there before is
like--

2699
03:09:13,690 --> 03:09:15,148
LIAM: Okay, I just walk away.

2700
03:09:16,458 --> 03:09:19,267
MATT: As you walk away, he just goes, "Yeah,
that's what I thought."

2701
03:09:19,267 --> 03:09:20,022
LIAM: Cat kicker.

2702
03:09:21,452 --> 03:09:25,969
MATT: "Quick meeting, right? Quick fucking
meeting."

2703
03:09:25,969 --> 03:09:26,933
SAM: Kill that guy.

2704
03:09:26,933 --> 03:09:27,872
LAURA: What a dick.

2705
03:09:28,492 --> 03:09:30,026
MARISHA: You just made some guard's night.

2706
03:09:34,486 --> 03:09:35,817
TALIESIN: We got to kill that guard.

2707
03:09:35,817 --> 03:09:36,687
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's gone.

2708
03:09:36,687 --> 03:09:44,490
MATT: You are escorted to the exterior of the
Pillow Trove, which would be over here in the Tri-Spires.

2709
03:09:46,525 --> 03:09:48,817
MARISHA: I wonder how much of the Tri-Spires is
like this?

2710
03:09:48,817 --> 03:09:50,306
TRAVIS: It's got to be locked up--

2711
03:09:50,306 --> 03:09:50,905
MARISHA: Right?

2712
03:09:50,905 --> 03:09:51,941
LIAM: Yeah, it's fancy pants.

2713
03:09:51,941 --> 03:09:59,322
MATT: You're led down the beautiful cobblestone
street. Around the bend of this beautiful

2714
03:09:59,785 --> 03:10:04,825
courtyard where you can see a family that is
currently sitting down and having an open-air

2715
03:10:04,825 --> 03:10:11,721
picnic here amongst the grass. Butterflies in the
air, it's picturesque to the point where you

2716
03:10:11,721 --> 03:10:20,942
question how engineered it is to a certain degree.
With a couple of quick spins, you see one that

2717
03:10:20,942 --> 03:10:29,795
catches your eye, which is really interesting,
this massive one of the Tri-Spire towers that's

2718
03:10:29,795 --> 03:10:36,120
closest to the vicinity of The Pillow Trove, looks
like it was this old temple that's been completely

2719
03:10:36,120 --> 03:10:44,932
hollowed out and re-purposed to look like a glitzy
casino. There are banners that are pulled across

2720
03:10:44,932 --> 03:10:51,984
in brightly-colored silks that mingle and braid
into each other. You can see on each different

2721
03:10:51,984 --> 03:10:56,953
floor there's a different tone to the stone that's
been slightly altered, and you can see signs

2722
03:10:56,953 --> 03:11:06,587
showing different forms of entertainment. It's
simultaneously historically awe-inspiring and

2723
03:11:06,587 --> 03:11:10,433
gaudy combination that is intriguing.

2724
03:11:10,433 --> 03:11:11,645
LAURA: Like Caesar's Palace?

2725
03:11:11,645 --> 03:11:17,045
MATT: Kind of, yeah. It's a little Vegas-y,
compared to the rest of this area. You can see a

2726
03:11:17,045 --> 03:11:20,537
lot of the--

2727
03:11:20,537 --> 03:11:22,846
MARISHA: There's clouds painted on the ceiling for
no reason.

2728
03:11:23,486 --> 03:11:29,170
MATT: At the corners of these roads, you can see
these tall lanterns that contain a very faintly

2729
03:11:29,170 --> 03:11:37,775
ever-burning flame. Between each of them, there's
a long, white, silken banner that hangs as part of

2730
03:11:37,775 --> 03:11:43,303
decoration along each road. The roads themselves
feel like they're always in some loose parade-type

2731
03:11:43,303 --> 03:11:49,686
celebration, that's just part of the decor of the
vicinity. The stark contrast between the

2732
03:11:49,686 --> 03:11:58,726
Outersteads, to even the moderately average
Innersteads, to the Tri-Spires is astronomical.

2733
03:11:59,256 --> 03:12:01,452
LAURA: Can I ask the guard: What is that
building?

2734
03:12:02,742 --> 03:12:04,331
MATT: "Have you not been here before?"

2735
03:12:04,331 --> 03:12:06,181
LAURA: No. I'm new to town, actually.

2736
03:12:07,201 --> 03:12:21,153
MATT: "Interesting. You're in the Silken Terrace.
What you're looking at right there is called the

2737
03:12:21,153 --> 03:12:32,443
Triumph Chime. It's got all sorts of bars,
gambling halls, inn rooms, brothel, everything you

2738
03:12:32,443 --> 03:12:33,315
need up here."

2739
03:12:33,315 --> 03:12:36,281
LAURA: Oh, wow. I didn't think you had things like
this in the Empire.

2740
03:12:37,471 --> 03:12:42,133
MATT: "We've got them in places. What, you think
we're uncivilized folk? Where are you from?"

2741
03:12:42,133 --> 03:12:45,418
LAURA: I'm from the Menagerie Coast, actually.
Nicodranas.

2742
03:12:46,248 --> 03:12:48,499
MATT: "Huh. Well, you'll feel right at home,
yeah."

2743
03:12:48,929 --> 03:12:49,681
LAURA: Quite.

2744
03:12:51,471 --> 03:12:55,593
MATT: "Well, here you are. Pillow Trove." As he
motions over to the side, you see this luxurious

2745
03:12:55,593 --> 03:13:02,664
inn that has this cylindrical appearance to the
front and then turns into a blocky building

2746
03:13:02,664 --> 03:13:14,226
behind. It has this gold and deep purple
coloration to the pillars that hold up the various

2747
03:13:14,226 --> 03:13:22,301
walls to each intersection, and as soon as you
walk inside, the scents of scented candles and

2748
03:13:22,301 --> 03:13:31,060
various lavender-type smells hit your nose. The
element of it reminds you of home. As you walk

2749
03:13:31,060 --> 03:13:40,434
inside, there's a beautiful semi-circle desk, and
a human woman, probably in her mid-20s or so, jet

2750
03:13:40,434 --> 03:13:45,324
black hair that's straight and dangles past her
shoulders, watches you approach, as the guard

2751
03:13:45,324 --> 03:13:47,465
says, "I'll wait here and escort you out when
you're done."

2752
03:13:47,465 --> 03:13:59,722
LAURA: Thank you very much, kind sir! I walk
grandiosely up to the woman. Hello. I have a

2753
03:13:59,722 --> 03:14:02,449
package that's being delivered to here.

2754
03:14:04,489 --> 03:14:07,048
MATT: "Very well. What is the name receiving?"

2755
03:14:07,048 --> 03:14:07,935
LAURA: Jester.

2756
03:14:09,475 --> 03:14:13,109
MATT: "I shall inquire. I'll be back here in just
a moment."

2757
03:14:13,109 --> 03:14:14,694
LAURA: Thank you very much.

2758
03:14:14,694 --> 03:14:18,956
MATT: As she leaves from the front desk, you can
see there are two crownsguard that are assigned to

2759
03:14:18,956 --> 03:14:23,902
the sides that are keeping a close watch on you,
but they're lackadaisy through their day. You

2760
03:14:23,902 --> 03:14:30,200
get the sense they probably don't have to work too
hard this side of the city. About five minutes pass.

2761
03:14:31,012 --> 03:14:33,297
LAURA: Is anybody watching me?

2762
03:14:33,833 --> 03:14:40,579
MATT: They're both watching you, but not intently
like hawks, more just making sure you're not doing

2763
03:14:40,579 --> 03:14:52,353
anything silly. You watch as a rather bounding
obese merchant in his late 40s or so comes

2764
03:14:52,353 --> 03:14:59,885
barreling down the stairway, sniffling hard and
rubbing his nose. He's dressed really well-- maybe

2765
03:14:59,885 --> 03:15:05,474
a size too small, trying to reclaim a presentation
maybe of a younger self and he hasn't quite come

2766
03:15:05,474 --> 03:15:10,966
to terms with the fact that he's hitting that age.
As he walks past, he goes, "Ah. Good day."

2767
03:15:11,436 --> 03:15:12,317
LAURA: Good day.

2768
03:15:13,487 --> 03:15:18,095
MATT: He exits the building. Another five minutes
pass, and eventually the woman comes back and she

2769
03:15:18,095 --> 03:15:25,470
goes, "I'm sorry, we don't have a package for that
name here. Is there any other it might be under?"

2770
03:15:25,470 --> 03:15:27,987
LAURA: Maybe under Lavorre?

2771
03:15:29,687 --> 03:15:30,796
MATT: "I'll check."

2772
03:15:30,796 --> 03:15:31,420
LAURA: Okay.

2773
03:15:31,420 --> 03:15:38,821
MATT: She leaves again for another few minutes.
Comes back after that, "I'm sorry, there's nothing

2774
03:15:38,821 --> 03:15:39,630
under that name."

2775
03:15:41,460 --> 03:15:44,526
LAURA: Anything from The Ruby of the Sea, maybe?

2776
03:15:46,456 --> 03:15:47,611
MATT: "I'll check one more time."

2777
03:15:47,611 --> 03:15:48,493
LAURA: Okay, thank you.

2778
03:15:48,493 --> 03:15:49,655
MATT: She leaves.

2779
03:15:50,485 --> 03:15:53,324
LAURA: I smile back at the guard, like (pained
laugh) this is crazy, isn't it?

2780
03:15:55,514 --> 03:16:02,491
MATT: She comes back out. "I'm terribly sorry, we
do not have a package for or under any of those names.

2781
03:16:04,502 --> 03:16:15,804
LAURA: Well, that's really weird. Okay. Well, tell
you what, how about, because it's probably going

2782
03:16:15,804 --> 03:16:24,601
to be coming, you know, I'm here really early for
it, you know-- so if it comes for me-- when it

2783
03:16:24,601 --> 03:16:31,339
does-- could you leave word with the guard outside
the Tri-Spire?

2784
03:16:33,219 --> 03:16:34,098
MATT: "Which one?"

2785
03:16:34,478 --> 03:16:36,114
LAURA: The guard house, you know.

2786
03:16:36,114 --> 03:16:37,418
MATT: "Oh. All right, okay."

2787
03:16:37,418 --> 03:16:41,488
LAURA: Then I can come and ask if it's been
delivered and then I can come, because I don't

2788
03:16:41,488 --> 03:16:44,681
want to have to walk all the way here, you know,
if it's not here for me yet.

2789
03:16:44,681 --> 03:16:46,122
MATT: "Very well. I'll make a note of it."

2790
03:16:46,122 --> 03:16:49,818
LAURA: Okay. Unless I should maybe stay here,
waiting for it?

2791
03:16:50,488 --> 03:16:53,075
MATT: "If you like, we could set you up with a
room."

2792
03:16:53,075 --> 03:16:55,091
LAURA: Oh! Yes, how much would that be?

2793
03:16:55,521 --> 03:17:00,977
MATT: "Well, depends on the size. We have our
general suites, we have the lordly suites, and

2794
03:17:00,977 --> 03:17:08,043
then we have the diplomatic invitational suites.
Pricing begins at ten gold per room for the basic

2795
03:17:08,043 --> 03:17:13,551
suites, 20 for the next tier up, and for the
diplomatic ones, those run about 50 gold a night."

2796
03:17:14,261 --> 03:17:24,907
LAURA: Well, I normally stay in the diplomatic
rooms, but I guess the smallest room because, you

2797
03:17:24,907 --> 03:17:25,956
know, I'm small.

2798
03:17:26,516 --> 03:17:29,705
MATT: "Of course. Ten gold per night, how long do
you plan to stay?"

2799
03:17:31,725 --> 03:17:35,973
LAURA: Probably just tonight, because it'll
probably be here in the morning.

2800
03:17:35,973 --> 03:17:37,934
MATT: "All right. That was Jester, right?"

2801
03:17:37,934 --> 03:17:38,400
LAURA: Yes.

2802
03:17:38,400 --> 03:17:39,764
MATT: "Very well, all right."

2803
03:17:41,734 --> 03:17:43,330
LAURA: Oh yes, here you go, thank you.

2804
03:17:43,330 --> 03:17:45,327
MATT: "Thank you, and here is the key to your
room."

2805
03:17:45,327 --> 03:17:45,906
LAURA: Oh, thank you!

2806
03:17:45,906 --> 03:17:50,618
MATT: "Second floor, third door on the left, it
should be number 12."

2807
03:17:50,618 --> 03:17:53,031
LAURA: 12, that's my favorite number!

2808
03:17:54,481 --> 03:17:56,361
MATT: "So sorry I couldn't be of help with you."

2809
03:17:56,361 --> 03:17:59,438
LAURA: Okay. I go upstairs.

2810
03:18:00,708 --> 03:18:01,247
MATT: Okay.

2811
03:18:01,687 --> 03:18:02,676
LAURA: I sit down.

2812
03:18:03,216 --> 03:18:07,367
MATT: You get into your room. The door opens, it's
a beautiful small room, but well decorated and a

2813
03:18:07,367 --> 03:18:16,168
nice queen-size canopy bed and a dresser with a
mirror, a chair, a little--

2814
03:18:17,668 --> 03:18:18,536
SAM: Mini-fridge.

2815
03:18:20,246 --> 03:18:20,731
TALIESIN: Wet bar.

2816
03:18:20,731 --> 03:18:41,460
LAURA: Right? Hmm. Traveler? Are you here? Shit.
Okay. I don't know where I'm staying tonight,

2817
03:18:41,460 --> 03:18:47,841
Traveler, I might be here, I might be with my
friends, but-- Okay, I'll see you soon, okay! And

2818
03:18:47,841 --> 03:18:49,532
I run back out of the room.

2819
03:18:49,532 --> 03:18:56,989
MATT: You turn and in the hallway to where you
entered, you see a familiar cloak of deep green, hooded.

2820
03:18:57,538 --> 03:19:01,060
LAURA: (gasps) Hi!

2821
03:19:02,220 --> 03:19:09,719
MATT: The cloak nods down towards you and the
voice slowly cascades out from underneath, "I'm so

2822
03:19:09,719 --> 03:19:19,954
sorry she's not aware that you're here now, but
you're with friends."

2823
03:19:24,474 --> 03:19:32,068
LAURA: Okay. Do you think you could help me,
though?

2824
03:19:35,468 --> 03:19:38,564
MATT: "Child, I think I help you quite a bit
already."

2825
03:19:38,564 --> 03:19:41,282
LAURA: I know. You do.

2826
03:19:43,252 --> 03:19:44,425
MATT: "What do you need?"

2827
03:19:44,425 --> 03:19:48,928
LAURA: I don't know how to let her know-- I don't
know what to do.

2828
03:19:54,198 --> 03:19:58,420
MATT: He leans forward and the hand reaches out
and takes your chin a little bit and holds it

2829
03:19:58,420 --> 03:20:05,934
there. There in the dark space of the hood, you
can see the familiar verdant irises looking back

2830
03:20:05,934 --> 03:20:13,212
and the warmth fills you once more, the comfort
that kept you comfortable so many years alone in

2831
03:20:13,212 --> 03:20:32,834
that room. "I think the more deeds you do, the
more lives you change, the more confident brats

2832
03:20:32,834 --> 03:20:38,023
you break-- She'll find you."

2833
03:20:39,263 --> 03:20:44,618
LAURA: Okay. I pull out the pamphlet. Look what I
made for you!

2834
03:20:47,698 --> 03:20:53,352
MATT: The hand pulls back and takes the pamphlet.
"Hmm. Adorable."

2835
03:20:56,702 --> 03:20:59,620
LAURA: People are going to worship you like
crazy.

2836
03:21:00,690 --> 03:21:02,246
MATT: "You know what to do, then?"

2837
03:21:02,246 --> 03:21:05,940
LAURA: Yes! Okay. I missed you.

2838
03:21:07,200 --> 03:21:08,086
MATT: "I'm never far."

2839
03:21:11,696 --> 03:21:14,365
LAURA: (high-pitched) All right, I'm going to
walk, if you want to follow me, I'm going to go

2840
03:21:14,365 --> 03:21:15,306
over here then.

2841
03:21:15,306 --> 03:21:22,929
MATT: As you look down at the pamphlet and look up
to say that, he's gone. You hear this faint little

2842
03:21:22,929 --> 03:21:25,569
(chuckles).

2843
03:21:26,449 --> 03:21:27,908
LAURA: I skip away.

2844
03:21:30,248 --> 03:21:30,934
TRAVIS: Skip away?

2845
03:21:33,464 --> 03:21:39,240
LAURA: I go back to the guard. Okay, I have a room
here. I don't know if you need to escort me

2846
03:21:39,240 --> 03:21:43,887
anymore because I'm staying here at The Pillow
Trove, but I'm going to go, okay?

2847
03:21:44,717 --> 03:21:45,630
MATT: "Um, all right."

2848
03:21:46,680 --> 03:21:47,084
LAURA: Okay.

2849
03:21:48,474 --> 03:21:49,030
MATT: "You're welcome."

2850
03:21:49,030 --> 03:21:51,597
LAURA: Hey, guard, what's your name?

2851
03:21:53,237 --> 03:21:53,898
MATT: "Reeve."

2852
03:21:53,898 --> 03:21:56,164
LAURA: Reeve, it's so nice to meet you, I'm
Jester.

2853
03:21:56,164 --> 03:21:59,939
MATT: He had his hand out, looks like he's
expecting some sort of a tip--

2854
03:21:59,939 --> 03:22:01,305
LAURA: And I shake it.

2855
03:22:01,305 --> 03:22:02,443
MATT: "Oh, okay."

2856
03:22:02,443 --> 03:22:08,158
LAURA: Hey, so that guy that I hired to guard me,
I gave him some money. What am I supposed to do,

2857
03:22:08,158 --> 03:22:11,508
am I allowed to get him in here so he can actually
do his job?

2858
03:22:11,508 --> 03:22:19,395
MATT: "He's not an interior guard. Based on his
markings, it looks like he's supposed to be at the perimeter."

2859
03:22:19,395 --> 03:22:23,755
LAURA: The guy that was all in his tattered coat
and stuff?

2860
03:22:23,755 --> 03:22:25,373
MATT: "Oh! I misunderstood."

2861
03:22:25,373 --> 03:22:26,027
LAURA: Yeah.

2862
03:22:28,237 --> 03:22:29,074
MATT: "He's not coming in."

2863
03:22:29,074 --> 03:22:33,408
LAURA: But I hired him to guard me, though.

2864
03:22:35,248 --> 03:22:39,651
MATT: "I'm sorry, we have to maintain a certain
kind of presentation here."

2865
03:22:43,461 --> 03:22:45,318
LAURA: All right. Okay.

2866
03:22:45,318 --> 03:22:50,720
LIAM: Quickly, could I have asked around and found
my way to the other entrance to this area by now?

2867
03:22:50,720 --> 03:22:52,604
TRAVIS: Or to a Banana Republic, maybe?

2868
03:22:52,604 --> 03:22:55,900
(laughter)

2869
03:22:55,900 --> 03:22:59,591
LIAM: No, I have this. Super quick: a single
question at the gate.

2870
03:22:59,591 --> 03:23:02,327
MATT: Yeah, in this time you could have made your
way around.

2871
03:23:02,327 --> 03:23:05,810
LIAM: Ask around, find my way there. All right, so
I walk up straight, looking like me.

2872
03:23:05,810 --> 03:23:06,315
MATT: Yeah.

2873
03:23:07,225 --> 03:23:12,889
LIAM: Excuse me, may I have a word of your time--
may I have a moment of your time?

2874
03:23:12,889 --> 03:23:13,633
MATT: "Piss off."

2875
03:23:15,213 --> 03:23:21,621
LIAM: Listen to me, there is a store in here
called Chastity's Nook that sells dirty books. I

2876
03:23:21,916 --> 03:23:27,101
have heard of it for months, and I am going to
shop at this store, and if you want to make three

2877
03:23:27,101 --> 03:23:33,196
gold-- and if this one wants to make three gold--
you will let me in there to shop for smut at the store.

2878
03:23:33,196 --> 03:23:40,969
MATT: You watch as his face-- His eyes go wide for
a second and he goes, "You're a fan of the

2879
03:23:40,969 --> 03:23:42,075
Chastity Nook?"

2880
03:23:44,195 --> 03:23:45,294
LIAM: I want to be.

2881
03:23:47,664 --> 03:23:49,240
MATT: "You hear that?"

2882
03:23:50,510 --> 03:23:54,598
LIAM: One, two, three. One, two, three, each of
you.

2883
03:23:54,598 --> 03:23:57,047
MARISHA: The guard's a critter!

2884
03:23:57,047 --> 03:23:57,738
MATT: "No!"

2885
03:23:57,738 --> 03:24:00,543
ALL: Aww!

2886
03:24:01,213 --> 03:24:02,214
MARISHA: Damn it!

2887
03:24:02,705 --> 03:24:05,681
LAURA: You know, for six gold, you could buy
yourself some real fancy clothes.

2888
03:24:07,471 --> 03:24:11,591
MATT: "I appreciate what you're trying to do, pay
off a Crownsguard of the city of Zadash to let

2889
03:24:11,591 --> 03:24:17,824
you, a lowlife from the skids of the town, in the
most expensive and most well-guarded region of the

2890
03:24:17,824 --> 03:24:20,606
city. I like my job, I like my head."

2891
03:24:23,446 --> 03:24:26,187
LIAM: Okay, enjoy working for the man. I walk
off.

2892
03:24:26,187 --> 03:24:28,910
TRAVIS: Yeah! Anarchy!

2893
03:24:29,710 --> 03:24:30,372
TALIESIN: Boom!

2894
03:24:32,472 --> 03:24:32,843
LIAM: Done.

2895
03:24:34,223 --> 03:24:34,812
MATT: Jester?

2896
03:24:36,232 --> 03:24:37,761
LAURA: I guess I go back to Caleb.

2897
03:24:39,211 --> 03:24:42,198
MATT: Okay. You guys meet up on the outside of the
district.

2898
03:24:44,268 --> 03:24:45,194
LIAM: How was it?

2899
03:24:45,194 --> 03:24:52,023
LAURA: It was really pretty in there. People are
kind of stupid, but I did talk to the Traveler, so

2900
03:24:52,023 --> 03:24:56,178
everything's cool. Also, I don't have any money.

2901
03:24:57,238 --> 03:25:00,189
LIAM: That's okay, I have a little bit of money,
do you need some?

2902
03:25:00,189 --> 03:25:01,425
LAURA: No, I mean I have--

2903
03:25:01,425 --> 03:25:02,978
LIAM: I have about 50 gold, do you want me to give
you some?

2904
03:25:02,978 --> 03:25:06,530
LAURA: I mean, that's about as much as I have now.
It's so stupid, though!

2905
03:25:06,530 --> 03:25:07,925
LIAM: That's a lot of money!

2906
03:25:07,925 --> 03:25:09,589
LAURA: It's not, Caleb.

2907
03:25:09,589 --> 03:25:10,891
LIAM: It is!

2908
03:25:10,891 --> 03:25:12,734
LAURA: It's not!

2909
03:25:13,274 --> 03:25:16,812
LIAM: That's more money than my parents ever made
in their entire life.

2910
03:25:16,812 --> 03:25:20,926
LAURA: That's what I made, like, every day for my
allowance!

2911
03:25:25,506 --> 03:25:31,884
LIAM: In full view of Jester, I reach into my
pocket and take what's left of the mud and just--

2912
03:25:31,884 --> 03:25:39,798
Then I storm off towards our original shitty inn.

2913
03:25:39,798 --> 03:25:44,090
LAURA: Caleb! I didn't mean to make you put your
shit on your face again.

2914
03:25:45,220 --> 03:25:46,120
LIAM: I don't hear that.

2915
03:25:46,120 --> 03:25:54,451
MATT: As you guys jaunt off to catch up with the
rest of the troop, meeting probably-- because you

2916
03:25:54,451 --> 03:26:02,110
guys would probably be heading back to The Leaky
Tap. You manage to gather in the center of the

2917
03:26:02,110 --> 03:26:09,910
common area. You see a freshly-muddied Caleb enter
with a somewhat flustered, but smiling, Jester.

2918
03:26:10,198 --> 03:26:11,002
TRAVIS: Hey-- oh.

2919
03:26:11,530 --> 03:26:13,533
MARISHA: Yeah! Hi-- oh.

2920
03:26:14,543 --> 03:26:17,622
TALIESIN: We're clean, we're relaxed, we're ready
to go into a sewer.

2921
03:26:19,252 --> 03:26:21,442
TRAVIS: Fitting, absolutely fitting.

2922
03:26:22,282 --> 03:26:24,493
ASHLEY: How did-- didn't you just--?

2923
03:26:25,123 --> 03:26:28,928
SAM: This is his normal look-- I think it's very
nice, actually.

2924
03:26:28,928 --> 03:26:29,628
TALIESIN: I do, too.

2925
03:26:29,628 --> 03:26:38,766
ASHLEY: I thought we took a-- Hey, I am not a
person to judge. I know I don't look-- It's fine.

2926
03:26:38,766 --> 03:26:40,945
Where are we going again?

2927
03:26:40,945 --> 03:26:43,586
LIAM: I like you. Do you want to hang with us for
a while?

2928
03:26:44,206 --> 03:26:45,020
ASHLEY: I don't know.

2929
03:26:47,200 --> 03:26:48,719
LIAM: Oh, this day is great!

2930
03:26:51,669 --> 03:26:52,388
TRAVIS: We'll take it.

2931
03:26:52,388 --> 03:26:53,920
ASHLEY: Well, let's go kill something, yeah?

2932
03:26:53,920 --> 03:26:55,679
TRAVIS: We're going to the outer wall of the
Tri-Spire.

2933
03:26:55,679 --> 03:26:56,274
MARISHA: What time is it?

2934
03:26:56,724 --> 03:26:59,091
MATT: By now, I'd say it's probably closer to
three in the afternoon--

2935
03:26:59,091 --> 03:27:00,643
LIAM: It's beast killing time!

2936
03:27:00,643 --> 03:27:02,698
MARISHA: Oh, it's beast killing time, yeah!

2937
03:27:02,698 --> 03:27:04,113
TALIESIN: It's time to eat some roast beast.

2938
03:27:04,113 --> 03:27:07,037
TRAVIS: Maybe a late lunch, carb up, and then
let's fucking--

2939
03:27:07,037 --> 03:27:07,625
MARISHA: Yeah!

2940
03:27:07,625 --> 03:27:08,380
TALIESIN: Let's carb up.

2941
03:27:09,490 --> 03:27:10,328
ASHLEY: Pot roast beast?

2942
03:27:10,328 --> 03:27:11,899
LAURA: Guess what, Molly.

2943
03:27:11,899 --> 03:27:12,490
TALIESIN: Hm?

2944
03:27:12,490 --> 03:27:14,380
LAURA: I got a room at The Pillow Trove.

2945
03:27:14,380 --> 03:27:16,665
TALIESIN: Why would you get a room at The Pillow
Trove?

2946
03:27:16,665 --> 03:27:21,458
LAURA: Well, because my package didn't come, so I
thought that maybe if I got a room there, then I

2947
03:27:21,458 --> 03:27:22,885
can check in in the morning as well, maybe?

2948
03:27:22,885 --> 03:27:27,680
TALIESIN: Oh, that's very clever, actually. Well
done. Are you still expecting your package?

2949
03:27:27,680 --> 03:27:30,895
LAURA: Yeah, it's been not enough time, I don't
think.

2950
03:27:30,895 --> 03:27:35,896
TALIESIN: Sometimes I expect things to show up and
then they don't. It can be very disappointing, but

2951
03:27:35,896 --> 03:27:37,541
it's all right. I'm sure it'll show up.

2952
03:27:37,541 --> 03:27:39,250
LAURA: It'll show up, of course it will.

2953
03:27:39,250 --> 03:27:40,534
TALIESIN: Not that it matters if it doesn't.

2954
03:27:41,694 --> 03:27:46,905
ASHLEY: The trick is to not expect anything in
life.

2955
03:27:48,215 --> 03:27:49,745
TALIESIN: I didn't expect you to say that.

2956
03:27:49,745 --> 03:27:50,498
LIAM: That's good advice.

2957
03:27:51,698 --> 03:27:54,267
ASHLEY: Then you'll never be disappointed, you
know?

2958
03:27:54,267 --> 03:27:55,205
TALIESIN: That's very true.

2959
03:27:56,455 --> 03:28:00,581
MARISHA: Yeah, here's to abandoning expectations!

2960
03:28:00,581 --> 03:28:03,152
TRAVIS: Abandoning expectations!

2961
03:28:03,152 --> 03:28:04,661
SAM: Where did we get these drinks?

2962
03:28:04,661 --> 03:28:09,528
(laughter)

2963
03:28:09,528 --> 03:28:10,763
ASHLEY: On the way home from the airport!

2964
03:28:12,463 --> 03:28:18,197
MATT: Taking a little bit of liquid courage as you
muster your weaponry and gather your way to the

2965
03:28:18,197 --> 03:28:28,822
direction to the entry of the sewer where the
currently acquired mercenary contract had been taken.

2966
03:28:28,822 --> 03:28:32,740
MARISHA: Before we enter, Beau says: Wait, should
we have done research on what we're fighting?

2967
03:28:32,740 --> 03:28:33,765
SAM: Nah, we'll be fine.

2968
03:28:33,765 --> 03:28:34,638
MARISHA: All right, let's go!

2969
03:28:34,638 --> 03:28:38,215
(laughter)

2970
03:28:38,215 --> 03:28:39,563
MATT: And that's where we'll pick up next week.

2971
03:28:39,563 --> 03:28:42,256
(cheering)

2972
03:28:42,256 --> 03:28:42,816
TRAVIS: Yasha!

2973
03:28:42,816 --> 03:28:47,120
ALL: Yasha!

2974
03:28:47,120 --> 03:28:51,960
LIAM: Send all of your complaints for not knowing
what would happen in the porno shop to @matthewmercer.

2975
03:28:54,450 --> 03:28:55,355
MATT: Sorry, man!

2976
03:28:56,495 --> 03:28:58,197
LAURA: You just got to get some fancy clothes,
man!

2977
03:28:58,197 --> 03:29:02,696
TALIESIN: I was just waiting for the drop to look
at the shoes and you look back and yep, no, those

2978
03:29:02,696 --> 03:29:03,715
shoes don't get in here.

2979
03:29:03,715 --> 03:29:08,071
TRAVIS: We got to figure out how to get rid of the
Disguise Self blockage, that's a big-- What caused that?

2980
03:29:08,098 --> 03:29:12,668
SAM: We can go over the wall, around the wall,
under the wall--

2981
03:29:12,668 --> 03:29:13,350
TRAVIS: Plus, there are sewers.

2982
03:29:13,350 --> 03:29:15,113
LIAM: The place is crawling with--

2983
03:29:15,113 --> 03:29:17,470
MARISHA: If it's a vicinity thing--

2984
03:29:17,470 --> 03:29:21,209
SAM: We will get you porn, Liam. We will get you
porn.

2985
03:29:21,209 --> 03:29:23,029
TRAVIS: Smut you shall have!

2986
03:29:23,029 --> 03:29:25,501
MARISHA: I agree, I think you just need a nice
coat.

2987
03:29:25,501 --> 03:29:27,038
LIAM: Got to get to that shop, man.

2988
03:29:27,038 --> 03:29:28,523
MARISHA: A nice coat can get you porn.

2989
03:29:28,523 --> 03:29:35,002
MATT: Please continue to try! Not every means to
an end is the easiest and most straightforward, man.

2990
03:29:35,002 --> 03:29:38,776
TALIESIN: When I was young, we would stack three
up and put on a coat.

2991
03:29:38,776 --> 03:29:44,465
MATT: I want this to be an Ocean's Eleven-style,
like three episode mini-arc to get into the smut

2992
03:29:44,465 --> 03:29:46,613
shop, that's what I want.

2993
03:29:46,613 --> 03:29:47,889
(laughter)

2994
03:29:51,179 --> 03:29:53,184
LIAM: Got reasons.

2995
03:29:53,184 --> 03:29:58,675
MATT: Thank you guys so much for watching. Those
I'll see in Kentucky, I'll see you soon. Oh, boy.

2996
03:29:58,675 --> 03:30:04,422
MARISHA: Take care of my boy, home-state. Be good
to him.

2997
03:30:04,422 --> 03:30:07,178
MATT: Be back next week, with Ashley.

2998
03:30:07,178 --> 03:30:08,518
ALL: Yay!

2999
03:30:08,518 --> 03:30:10,647
MATT: Excited to have you home for a little
longer.

3000
03:30:10,647 --> 03:30:12,698
ASHLEY: Yeah! Just a little bit.

3001
03:30:12,698 --> 03:30:20,097
MATT: I missed you. There was something else I was
supposed to talk about.

3002
03:30:20,097 --> 03:30:23,198
SAM: Yes, you were supposed to say something about
giveaways or something.

3003
03:30:23,198 --> 03:30:26,505
MATT: No, I already commented on the giveaway.
What was it?

3004
03:30:26,505 --> 03:30:28,222
SAM: What were you supposed to say?

3005
03:30:28,222 --> 03:30:30,778
MATT: Where'd Lockey go? He was supposed to remind
me of something.

3006
03:30:32,422 --> 03:30:36,729
MATT: Anyway. I'll put it on Twitter if I remember
what it was. Anyway, love you guys, take care of

3007
03:30:36,729 --> 03:30:41,458
yourselves, we'll see you next week, and is it
Thursday yet? Good night.

3008
03:30:41,458 --> 03:30:42,655
LIAM: It still is!

3009
03:30:42,655 --> 03:30:44,496
MATT: We had a bathhouse episode!
