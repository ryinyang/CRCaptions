00:00:00,172 --> 00:00:03,303
MATT: Hello everyone! And welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where us nerdy-ass voice

2
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:07,410
actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons.
Slight delay there due to tech issues but we're

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:17,742
back online and all is well. Tick issues are a
problem-- It's a thing, I know. We're going to

4
00:00:17,742 --> 00:00:22,669
jump in here shortly. We have a guest who'll be
joining us partway into the story. Before we get

5
00:00:22,669 --> 00:00:25,724
to that, let's go ahead and get to our
announcements and get them out of the way because

6
00:00:25,724 --> 00:00:29,603
we're a little behind. We'll try and rush through.
First and foremost, tonight our sponsor and has

7
00:00:29,603 --> 00:00:35,834
been our sponsor from the beginning and onward
into the campaign, our friends at D&D Beyond.

8
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:39,044
They've been awesome. Sam! You seem ready to say
something?

9
00:00:39,044 --> 00:00:41,625
SAM: You guys know what D&D Beyond is? It's
awesome. You should check out the site

10
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:48,908
dndbeyond.com. They also now have open alpha
access for an upcoming mobile app. The D&D Beyond

11
00:00:48,908 --> 00:00:54,042
team is looking for additional stress testers and
you can sign up using the following links. Insert

12
00:00:54,042 --> 00:00:57,283
links below me.

13
00:00:57,283 --> 00:01:00,176
MATT: In case they aren't--

14
00:01:00,176 --> 00:01:08,491
SAM: Oh, I have to read it? Okay, bit.ly/dndios
and bit.ly/dndandroid.

15
00:01:08,491 --> 00:01:11,247
MATT: Bit.ly as in bit dot ly.

16
00:01:11,247 --> 00:01:12,891
SAM: Yeah, they know what bit.ly is.

17
00:01:12,891 --> 00:01:14,448
MATT: I'm just making sure!

18
00:01:14,448 --> 00:01:20,453
SAM: Sure. Since D&D is such a dorky 80s thing to
do, I've composed a dorky 80s jingle for D&D

19
00:01:20,453 --> 00:01:22,159
Beyond.

20
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,136
(cheering)

21
00:01:24,136 --> 00:01:30,097
SAM: (singing) You got the perfect warlock, the
weapons and supplies, But you need a place to

22
00:01:30,097 --> 00:01:37,348
track your stuff, 'cause you're so disorganized!
You click open the web page you heard about on

23
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:48,723
Critical Role. Now you're ready to kick some butt
in that mineshaft full of gnolls! It's D&D! D&D

24
00:01:48,723 --> 00:01:58,701
Beyond. Yeah D&D! D&D Beyond. You got your stats,
you got your sword and you've got your invisible

25
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:06,345
wand! It's D&D! D&D (synthetic drum sound effects)
D&D Beyond!

26
00:02:06,345 --> 00:02:10,048
(cheering and applause)

27
00:02:10,085 --> 00:02:14,740
TRAVIS: Oh my god! If they don't make that they're
fools!

28
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,765
MARISHA: That was magic!

29
00:02:16,765 --> 00:02:18,904
LAURA: I want to see that!

30
00:02:18,904 --> 00:02:22,411
TRAVIS: We're going to make that right? We're
going to make that now.

31
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:27,385
MATT: There are moments like this that it makes me
a little sad that you're no longer a bard. At

32
00:02:27,385 --> 00:02:31,103
least we keep the Scanlan alive with shit like
this.

33
00:02:31,103 --> 00:02:33,320
TRAVIS: Tell me you were singing that in your car
on the way home from work.

34
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,313
SAM: I was.

35
00:02:35,313 --> 00:02:37,839
TALIESIN: I can see action figures busting through
walls being held by hands (explosion sound

36
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:39,945
effects).

37
00:02:39,945 --> 00:02:41,969
MATT: That was awesome. Thank you, Sam.

38
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:43,607
SAM: You had to imagine the synths.

39
00:02:43,607 --> 00:02:50,307
MATT: Oh yeah, we were there. Thank you D&D Beyond
for allowing that to happen as well as being a

40
00:02:50,307 --> 00:02:51,385
helpful tool.

41
00:02:51,385 --> 00:02:55,882
LIAM: Les Mis was a stepping stone for that
moment.

42
00:02:55,882 --> 00:03:04,201
MATT: Awesome. Next up. Reminder guys who have
Amazon Prime, with Twitch Prime, you can actually

43
00:03:04,201 --> 00:03:09,807
subscribe to a Twitch channel for free. One a
month with your Amazon Prime account. If you have

44
00:03:09,807 --> 00:03:12,717

45
00:03:12,717 --> 00:03:15,062

46
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:20,627
LIAM: (as Mickey Mouse) Comes with Prime!

47
00:03:20,627 --> 00:03:24,412
MATT: What is going on? I'm so scared.

48
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:28,149
TRAVIS: You hit a particular high note and we're
trying to do our best squeaky voice.

49
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:31,365
MATT: It's a really good idea to taunt the DM
before you start playing. I think it works out

50
00:03:31,365 --> 00:03:33,872
really well for everyone involved.

51
00:03:33,872 --> 00:03:37,287
LIAM: Like the internet, we like to obsess about
your every little movement.

52
00:03:37,287 --> 00:03:46,137
MATT: Of course, that's okay. I have a sense of
self. Talks Machina, of course, will be discussing

53
00:03:46,137 --> 00:03:52,624
tonight's episode next Tuesday with our host W.
Foster. Brian W. Foster. It's been a long day. W

54
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,109
Foster!

55
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,167
MARISHA: It's very formal.

56
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:59,081
MATT: Isn't it though? When he dresses up nice?
Tuesday at 7:00pm Pacific here at Twitch and

57
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:03,363
Project Alpha to discuss what happens tonight.
Check that out. Laura, you said there's a merch

58
00:04:03,363 --> 00:04:04,545
update.

59
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:09,719
LAURA: Yes! Hey! I don't know if you guys have
gone to the store lately but there's stuff in

60
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:16,449
there. The reason that I was talking today is
because I was informed that there's actually some

61
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:21,811
more CR dice, not the Vox Machina dice-- those
aren't back yet, but the CR dice are in stock if

62
00:04:21,811 --> 00:04:28,056
you've been wanting some of those. There's also
stickers and keychains and t-shirts-- lots of

63
00:04:28,056 --> 00:04:30,921
t-shirts you should check them out-- and notebooks
and awesome pencils.

64
00:04:30,921 --> 00:04:32,627
LIAM: Still got that art book.

65
00:04:32,627 --> 00:04:36,373
LAURA: That art book and an apron for the Slayer's
Cake.

66
00:04:36,373 --> 00:04:37,393
SAM: Just one?

67
00:04:37,393 --> 00:04:38,617
LAURA: Just one apron.

68
00:04:38,617 --> 00:04:41,438
MATT: A single apron, get it now before it's
gone. Awesome, thank you, Laura.

69
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:43,427
LAURA: Supplies are limited.

70
00:04:43,427 --> 00:04:48,255
MATT: The podcast for last week's episode is
available for download where all fine podcasts are

71
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:53,402
available on the internet. If you have friends
listening to the audio version, they be caught up,

72
00:04:53,402 --> 00:05:00,463
now. After this episode probably, they'll start it
now. You get it. We announced at Emerald City

73
00:05:00,463 --> 00:05:06,207
Comic Con we have a limited release, only 1000
copies of the physical copies of the Issue #1 of

74
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:07,678
the Vox Machina Origins comic.

75
00:05:07,678 --> 00:05:09,152
(shouts of excitement)

76
00:05:09,152 --> 00:05:11,516
MATT: Oh, I haven't seen it yet!

77
00:05:11,516 --> 00:05:13,364
LAURA: I haven't seen it in person yet!

78
00:05:13,364 --> 00:05:15,341
TALIESIN: It's all about the back.

79
00:05:15,341 --> 00:05:19,342
SAM: Don't open it! Your hands will touch it and
it will no longer be mint!

80
00:05:19,342 --> 00:05:20,958
(groaning)

81
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:25,021
TRAVIS: Now it's worth more. Keep going.

82
00:05:25,021 --> 00:05:30,015
MATT: There'll be 1000 copies there. The limit is
only five copies per person per day.

83
00:05:30,015 --> 00:05:31,979
MARISHA: Oh my goodness gracious.

84
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:33,757
SAM: You're on the back of a comic book?

85
00:05:33,757 --> 00:05:36,255
LAURA: Hey, and it's the Slayer's Cake apron that
I was just--

86
00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:40,447
MATT: (laughing) Thank you Laura for pointing that
out.

87
00:05:40,447 --> 00:05:44,153
(exclamations of awe)

88
00:05:44,153 --> 00:05:47,819
MATT: Dark Horse is releasing that for this
special event. Please check it out if you are

89
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:53,751
going to be there. Grab a copy if you want. It is
March 1st through the 4th, and our good cast

90
00:05:53,751 --> 00:05:56,706
members here Laura and Travis will be there.

91
00:05:56,706 --> 00:06:01,182
LAURA: Yes we will as well as-- You're going to be
there too.

92
00:06:01,182 --> 00:06:07,259
MATT: Oh shit! Well, there you go. You can go tell
him how much you liked his character tonight.

93
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:14,331
Speaking of the comic book: Issue five will be
released on digital platforms of that very comic

94
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:21,913
March 7th. Those that want to keep up and get to
the next chapter of the six issue arc, issue five

95
00:06:21,913 --> 00:06:25,065
comes out March 7th so keep an eye out for that
and we'll have announcements as that comes. You

96
00:06:25,065 --> 00:06:30,662
can look for a sneak peek at the artwork at
geekandsundry.com. Once again, our campaign is

97
00:06:30,662 --> 00:06:38,681
pushing our fantastic friends at 826LA. They're an
amazing charity group that takes underprivileged

98
00:06:38,681 --> 00:06:44,460
kids or children and young teens who don't have
the opportunity to get in depth and learn about

99
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,587
creative writing and give them a safe space for
them. They do wonderful work. Check it out if you

100
00:06:47,587 --> 00:06:51,503
have the opportunity. See if you can give either
financially or with your time and you can

101
00:06:51,503 --> 00:06:58,436
volunteer to be part of the program. It's really
great. Other than that, appearances are as they've

102
00:06:58,436 --> 00:07:01,042
been and I think--

103
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:06,918
SAM: I have one more thing. A quick shoutout to a
critter named Carol who is an awesome fantasy

104
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:11,294
writer and friend of the show. She's been feeling
a little under the weather but she's been watching

105
00:07:11,294 --> 00:07:16,250
our new campaign and I wanted to wish her a speedy
recovery and thanks for watching.

106
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:23,935
MATT: Love to you, Carol. All right guys, without
further ado, let's dive into tonight episode of

107
00:07:23,935 --> 00:07:26,614
Critical Role.

108
00:07:26,734 --> 00:07:31,190
[click, TV static]

109
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:35,989
[groovy Critical Role theme]

110
00:08:48,452 --> 00:08:52,763
(laughter)

111
00:08:52,763 --> 00:08:58,519
MATT: Welcome back. The DM will remember that.

112
00:08:58,977 --> 00:09:00,760
LIAM: Are we doing a show right now?

113
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,945
MATT: We are.

114
00:09:01,945 --> 00:09:03,297
LIAM: (whimpering) Okay.

115
00:09:03,297 --> 00:09:12,071
MATT: Welcome back. Last we left off: The group of
adventures in seeking a warband of gnolls which

116
00:09:12,071 --> 00:09:16,567
had attacked the city of Alfield they were passing
through on their way to Zadash. Began to track

117
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:21,554
them as to where they had retrieved a number of
bodies, both dead and living of the civilians of

118
00:09:21,554 --> 00:09:26,945
the town and taken them with them. You eventually
track them to an abandoned mine a number of miles

119
00:09:26,945 --> 00:09:33,767
away from the city to the northeast. You entered,
narrowly missed a trap or two, managed to recover

120
00:09:33,767 --> 00:09:40,454
a couple of interesting items, delved off to the
left side during the first divide of pathways, and

121
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:47,678
came upon some sort of small ritual with a number
of gnolls and some humanoid figure wearing bits of

122
00:09:47,678 --> 00:09:56,475
gnoll as an armor or cloak. Doing a ritual-- after
he had left along with the previously armored

123
00:09:56,475 --> 00:10:02,427
gnoll that you had battled during the incursion at
Alfield. You tore into a number of hyenas and

124
00:10:02,427 --> 00:10:06,960
gnolls that remained within the chamber and upon
defeating them, took a moment to take a breath,

125
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:15,100
get your bearings before hearing a muffled boom in
the distance, some sort a low vocalization, some

126
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:20,923
cackling, and eventually the scream of a woman
saying, "No, my baby!" You began to run and give

127
00:10:20,923 --> 00:10:30,993
chase. That is where we're picking up this week.
Grabbing your weapons and keeping your mettle

128
00:10:30,993 --> 00:10:38,321
about you, you charge further down the tunnel. The
shaft curves to the right in a wide spiral about a

129
00:10:38,321 --> 00:10:45,521
few dozen-- there we go. What was that?

130
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:47,178
TRAVIS: The shaft curves to the right.

131
00:10:47,178 --> 00:10:52,305
SAM: You said "The sha--" and she laughed. Like
before you were done with the word shaft.

132
00:10:52,305 --> 00:10:54,287
LAURA: Because the shaft curves to the right,
y'all.

133
00:10:54,384 --> 00:10:56,049
LIAM: It's her psychic power.

134
00:10:56,049 --> 00:10:57,894
TRAVIS: It's usually to the left, but whatever.

135
00:10:57,894 --> 00:10:59,414
MATT: It's okay.

136
00:10:59,414 --> 00:11:01,134
SAM: Not from her perspective.

137
00:11:01,134 --> 00:11:06,080
(laughter)

138
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,091
MATT: Boom!

139
00:11:08,091 --> 00:11:10,359
MARISHA: That's fair.

140
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:15,877
TRAVIS: Too fast! Like a fencer! That was
amazing!

141
00:11:15,877 --> 00:11:17,241
LAURA: Only you.

142
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:20,072
(laughter)

143
00:11:20,072 --> 00:11:22,945
MARISHA: Walked into that one.

144
00:11:22,945 --> 00:11:23,983
LIAM: Well.

145
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:26,049
MARISHA: Yeah.

146
00:11:26,049 --> 00:11:28,304
TRAVIS: Life or death. Here we go.

147
00:11:28,304 --> 00:11:32,441
MATT: The tunnel continues in a wide spiral before
eventually snaking a bit--

148
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:37,285
(laughter)

149
00:11:37,285 --> 00:11:40,364
MARISHA: You're an asshole.

150
00:11:40,364 --> 00:11:44,799
MATT: --before sharply turning to the right. The
tunnel straightens out before emerging into a

151
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:54,287
chamber of-- goddamn it guys, this is serious!
Lives are at stake here. Okay.

152
00:11:54,287 --> 00:11:55,430
(laughter)

153
00:11:57,273 --> 00:11:58,614
MARISHA: What were you going to say?

154
00:11:58,614 --> 00:12:00,896
TRAVIS: You got it. We're with you. Life or
death.

155
00:12:00,896 --> 00:12:02,764
SAM: The path--

156
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:06,575
MATT: The tunnel straightens out before emerging
into a chamber of mixed natural rock walls and

157
00:12:06,575 --> 00:12:10,898
simple stone work. Two other tunnels mark this
chamber as a Y intersection or like a second

158
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:16,822
common room. Similar to the one you that you
originally encountered when you entered the mine.

159
00:12:16,822 --> 00:12:22,314
Tables and stools are strewn about the area, with
a pair of hyenas currently picking at junk for

160
00:12:22,314 --> 00:12:26,168
scraps. You see bits of meat that are being
dragged across the ground by them about 20 feet

161
00:12:26,168 --> 00:12:31,581
off to the left. Two thick natural pillars of rock
currently stand as load bearing portions of the

162
00:12:31,581 --> 00:12:39,040
chamber breaking the open space while a crumpled
section of the floor drops into a pit below. Two

163
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:46,443
closed doors, to the left of where you're looking
into it, are guarded by a skeletal gnoll and two

164
00:12:46,443 --> 00:12:51,228
standard gnoll warriors, one of which has
apparently pulled a small child from one of the

165
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:58,051
doors. The sound of muffled cries coming from
beyond the closed door. Four other gnolls rush

166
00:12:58,051 --> 00:13:05,272
from within the chamber into the right tunnel
exiting on the opposite side. What do you guys

167
00:13:05,272 --> 00:13:06,195
do?

168
00:13:06,195 --> 00:13:07,248
MARISHA: Four to the right?

169
00:13:07,248 --> 00:13:12,071
MATT: You watch as four of them rush into the
other exit. There's an exit to the left and an

170
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:16,120
exit to the right. They exit the room to the right
and then there's three left: two regular--

171
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,263
MATT, TRAVIS, and MARISHA: (singing) Regular
gnolls!

172
00:13:19,263 --> 00:13:22,468
MATT: --and then one skeletal gnoll and then two
hyenas that are currently picking at scraps. You

173
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:26,054
can see as the gnoll pulls the child out, is
currently in the process of crying and they're

174
00:13:26,054 --> 00:13:29,636
both looking at each other like-- still holding
the child by the arm essentially-- but currently

175
00:13:29,636 --> 00:13:31,407
is bickering with the other gnoll.

176
00:13:31,407 --> 00:13:38,018
LIAM: From our vantage point, it is the entrance
that we're at and then there is doors to the

177
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:38,807
left--?

178
00:13:38,807 --> 00:13:40,424
MATT: Let me go ahead and give you a visual.

179
00:13:40,424 --> 00:13:43,768
TRAVIS: (singing) Visual aid, visual aid.

180
00:13:43,768 --> 00:13:45,586
LIAM, TRAVIS, AND MARISHA: (singing) Visual aid,
visual aid.

181
00:13:45,586 --> 00:13:48,137
LAURA: Oh no! If this is like a running thing this
whole campaign--

182
00:13:48,137 --> 00:13:50,020
TALIESIN: Oh, there's no getting away from this.

183
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,168
(laughter)

184
00:13:52,168 --> 00:13:55,009
(Oohs and ahs)

185
00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:58,766
LAURA: Look at that opening, it's so cool
looking!

186
00:13:58,766 --> 00:14:00,063
SAM: Where are we?

187
00:14:00,063 --> 00:14:02,374
MATT: You guys are entering from this side.

188
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:04,349
LAURA: Oh that's a little door? That's the door
you we're talking about?

189
00:14:04,349 --> 00:14:06,205
MATT: Yep.

190
00:14:06,205 --> 00:14:09,817
SAM: There's too many options!

191
00:14:09,817 --> 00:14:14,365
MATT: Essentially, over here-- You can place
yourselves as you feel necessary. Off to this

192
00:14:14,365 --> 00:14:18,064
side, in whichever marching order you prefer.

193
00:14:19,874 --> 00:14:22,109
LIAM: I will be at the rear.

194
00:14:22,688 --> 00:14:24,323
MATT: I figured as much.

195
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:27,558
LAURA: How old is the child that got pulled out of
the room?

196
00:14:27,558 --> 00:14:30,748
MATT: At first glance, it's hard to see,
especially for those of you who are keeping their

197
00:14:30,748 --> 00:14:34,819
light low, because there is no light source in the
chamber. Those with dark vision will be making out

198
00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:37,189
most of the details here.

199
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:39,272
TRAVIS: I'll be up front. I can do that.

200
00:14:39,272 --> 00:14:42,486
MATT: All right, that would put Fjord up at the
front.

201
00:14:42,486 --> 00:14:44,362
LAURA: I'll be behind Fjord.

202
00:14:44,362 --> 00:14:46,681
MATT: Okay.

203
00:14:48,605 --> 00:14:50,473
MARISHA: I can't see shit.

204
00:14:54,954 --> 00:15:05,777
MATT: Given this, you guys are deciding what to
do. There's, in a brief moment of quiet, a loud

205
00:15:05,777 --> 00:15:14,044
boom that shakes the interior of the chamber. You
watch as both the hyenas (squeal) look up, scared.

206
00:15:14,044 --> 00:15:18,168
The two gnolls immediately look about. Dust and
rocks begin to settle and fall from the ceiling as

207
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:25,097
it shakes and then comes to rest. A moment later,
a cloud of dust and smoke comes billowing out this

208
00:15:25,097 --> 00:15:33,877
side of the chamber where the four gnolls had run
previously. Then the rumbling settles. The gnolls

209
00:15:33,877 --> 00:15:42,249
themselves are spooked. Then, distracted from the
child at the moment, both peeking over, the undead

210
00:15:42,249 --> 00:15:50,598
gnoll stands there glancing about, seeming
unaffected by the current scenario. Passive

211
00:15:50,598 --> 00:15:57,547
perception, the highest on this would be
Beauregard, Caleb, Molly, and Jester, I believe.

212
00:15:57,547 --> 00:16:03,907
Actually, Caleb and Beauregard would not, because
they don't see anything. You guys hear sounds, and

213
00:16:03,907 --> 00:16:07,498
you're waiting for any inclination of light to
kick in.

214
00:16:07,498 --> 00:16:09,230
LAURA: What do we see, though?

215
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:16,740
MATT: You guys see the faint appearance of some
sort of a flying creature, very small, emerge from

216
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:21,284
the tunnel that had recently expelled all this
dust and smoke.

217
00:16:21,284 --> 00:16:23,343
LAURA: Frumpkin size or smaller?

218
00:16:23,343 --> 00:16:30,161
MATT: Frumpkin size. (humming) It hovers in the
air in a few places, and then locks itself over

219
00:16:30,161 --> 00:16:34,140
here onto this far wall, on a higher perch.

220
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,051
TRAVIS: Fucking bugs.

221
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:38,884
LAURA: Did you see that?

222
00:16:38,884 --> 00:16:40,324
TALIESIN: I think I saw that. Did you see that?

223
00:16:40,324 --> 00:16:41,815
LAURA: I saw that.

224
00:16:41,815 --> 00:16:53,564
MATT: (snarl) Another moment passes, and the
gnolls relax. You watch as the immediate dread of

225
00:16:53,564 --> 00:16:59,290
the recent explosion sound, the shocking and
rocking of the room, seems to have passed over

226
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:03,452
them. They both go back to paying attention to
their recent vicinity, which includes the small

227
00:17:03,452 --> 00:17:08,896
child, which is still quietly sobbing in the
painful grasp of this large curled gnoll hand.

228
00:17:08,896 --> 00:17:10,658
TALIESIN: On the count of three?

229
00:17:10,658 --> 00:17:11,955
SAM: Wait, are we just going to attack?

230
00:17:11,955 --> 00:17:13,064
TRAVIS: Yeah.

231
00:17:13,064 --> 00:17:14,439
SAM: We should distract them--!

232
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:15,456
LAURA: Radiant blast!

233
00:17:15,456 --> 00:17:16,941
SAM: Oh, Jesus.

234
00:17:16,941 --> 00:17:18,344
LAURA: Sacred Flame, I mean.

235
00:17:18,393 --> 00:17:23,589
MATT: All right. The ones who are making the
initial strike on this--

236
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:25,512
SAM: I could distract them or something first!

237
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:27,401
TRAVIS: Eldritch Blast for me, yeah.

238
00:17:27,401 --> 00:17:30,557
LIAM: I will also do that as well, following suit
with everybody.

239
00:17:30,557 --> 00:17:31,848
MARISHA: Wait, are things happening?

240
00:17:31,848 --> 00:17:33,225
LAURA: Don't hit the kid!

241
00:17:33,225 --> 00:17:34,861
MARISHA: We can't see! Do you have your lights?

242
00:17:34,861 --> 00:17:36,046
MATT: Caleb, you don't see anything.

243
00:17:36,046 --> 00:17:39,012
LIAM: Oh, okay.

244
00:17:39,012 --> 00:17:42,147
MATT: The ones who can see in the dark right now,
which would be the four of you, you guys get a

245
00:17:42,147 --> 00:17:43,475
round of attack on this.

246
00:17:43,475 --> 00:17:44,576
TRAVIS: Nice.

247
00:17:44,576 --> 00:17:48,903
MATT: Where you're currently positioned, I would
like you all to roll initiative before we get to

248
00:17:48,903 --> 00:17:50,653
your round, just so we have it.

249
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:53,161
TRAVIS: Come on, first roll of the night! Be
fucking amazing.

250
00:17:53,161 --> 00:17:55,306
TALIESIN: Yay!

251
00:17:55,306 --> 00:17:56,789
MATT: Not so much?

252
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:59,088
TRAVIS: I've had better.

253
00:17:59,088 --> 00:18:01,458
MATT: All righty. So--

254
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,921
SAM: I'm not drunk anymore, right?

255
00:18:04,146 --> 00:18:06,328
MATT: No, that's worn off.

256
00:18:06,328 --> 00:18:08,698
LIAM: Great. How about Nott?

257
00:18:10,066 --> 00:18:11,695
MATT: 25 to 20?

258
00:18:11,695 --> 00:18:12,377
MARISHA: 20.

259
00:18:12,377 --> 00:18:13,867
SAM: 24.

260
00:18:13,867 --> 00:18:15,146
ALL: Ooh!

261
00:18:15,146 --> 00:18:17,827
SAM: Natural 20.

262
00:18:18,876 --> 00:18:22,506
MATT: All right. 20 to 15.

263
00:18:22,506 --> 00:18:24,625
TALIESIN: 16.

264
00:18:25,043 --> 00:18:27,133
LAURA: But you can't see, Beau.

265
00:18:27,133 --> 00:18:29,930
MATT: She's missing the initial round.

266
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,579
LAURA: Oh, this is for the whole thing.

267
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:34,456
MATT: Correct. This is just general combat.

268
00:18:34,456 --> 00:18:37,205
LAURA: If I'd have known that, I would have rolled
better for the whole thing.

269
00:18:37,205 --> 00:18:38,985
MATT: That's true. Sorry about that. That's okay.

270
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:40,529
LAURA: I wasn't trying so hard.

271
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:41,918
MATT: 15 to ten?

272
00:18:41,918 --> 00:18:43,331
LAURA: Ten.

273
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:45,968
TALIESIN: That's very adequate.

274
00:18:45,968 --> 00:18:47,979
LIAM: I have rolled a nine.

275
00:18:50,219 --> 00:18:55,088
TALIESIN: This is going to be the thing for the
entire campaign. This is going to be the joke that

276
00:18:55,088 --> 00:18:57,359
never goes away. <i>Nein</i>!

277
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:59,046
LIAM: (singing) Regular gnoll, regular gnoll.

278
00:18:59,046 --> 00:19:00,986
LAURA: Oh no, oh no.

279
00:19:01,195 --> 00:19:04,142
LIAM: That's it. Just nine and regular gnoll,
that's all that we have. That's campaign two,

280
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:05,902
ladies and gentlemen.

281
00:19:05,902 --> 00:19:08,352
MATT: That leaves-- you rolled a what?

282
00:19:08,352 --> 00:19:09,421
TRAVIS: An eight.

283
00:19:09,421 --> 00:19:12,007
MARISHA: Nines and gnolls. That's our group name,
you guys.

284
00:19:12,007 --> 00:19:17,510
TALIESIN: No! Don't joke, don't ever.

285
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:27,919
SAM: It's one of the best rolls you can make in
the game. What is our initiative shit?

286
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:28,934
LAURA: Ah!

287
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:32,302
MATT: Nott, you're up first.

288
00:19:32,302 --> 00:19:36,751
SAM: Okay, but I didn't see, and you guys decided
to attack first. I will grace you going first if

289
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:39,973
you prefer.

290
00:19:39,973 --> 00:19:41,679
LAURA: You're going to hold your turn?

291
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,439
MATT: You feel the tension rising and you're like,
I'll follow their lead.

292
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:48,406
SAM: Does that mean I still get to move and shit
when I do my move?

293
00:19:48,406 --> 00:19:51,523
MATT: That means you're holding your action.

294
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:55,172
SAM: Then I'll go now. Because they're more than
30 feet away, right?

295
00:19:55,172 --> 00:19:57,588
MATT: Yeah. You can see what's out there, you just
don't notice the bird.

296
00:19:57,588 --> 00:20:06,468
SAM: Hand crossbow, it says 30/120. I've got to be
within 30 to hit them without disadvantage, right?

297
00:20:06,468 --> 00:20:14,017
If I run out there, they'll see me and I won't be
sneak attack anymore, right? How does this work?

298
00:20:14,017 --> 00:20:19,585
MATT: If they don't know you're there, which this
is currently what's considered an ambush round,

299
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,828
you still have advantage on your first strike if
they're not aware of your presence. Which means it

300
00:20:21,828 --> 00:20:23,766
would cancel out that disadvantage.

301
00:20:23,766 --> 00:20:26,458
SAM: I can take my shot from here.

302
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,722
MATT: You can, yes.

303
00:20:27,722 --> 00:20:29,300
SAM: All right. I will fire.

304
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,985
MATT: All right.

305
00:20:30,985 --> 00:20:34,395
SAM: Ooh! 17 plus a lot. Six! 17 plus six to hit.

306
00:20:34,395 --> 00:20:39,703
MATT: That hits. You do not get sneak attack on
this because you do not have advantage on the

307
00:20:39,703 --> 00:20:41,302
strike.

308
00:20:41,302 --> 00:20:43,260
SAM: I thought you just said I had advantage!

309
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,482
MATT: You had advantage, but you have disadvantage
because they're beyond the--

310
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:49,513
LIAM: It cancelled out your advantage. It's just a
straight roll and you lost the sneak attack.

311
00:20:49,513 --> 00:20:52,556
SAM: Could I run forward and still get the sneak
attack?

312
00:20:52,556 --> 00:20:53,663
MATT: You could try it.

313
00:20:53,663 --> 00:20:56,318
SAM: That's what I will do. Undo.

314
00:20:56,318 --> 00:20:58,808
LAURA: Roll again, because you might get natural
20!

315
00:20:58,808 --> 00:21:01,856
SAM: Now I have to roll for stealth, right?

316
00:21:01,856 --> 00:21:05,467
MATT: You've been stealthed as you crept up on
this from the last time, so go for it.

317
00:21:05,467 --> 00:21:07,527
SAM: I'm rolling to hit?

318
00:21:07,527 --> 00:21:08,968
MATT: You already hit on that.

319
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:11,553
LAURA: Roll again for advantage, you might get a
20.

320
00:21:11,553 --> 00:21:14,997
SAM: Okay. Still 17 plus six.

321
00:21:14,997 --> 00:21:16,430
MATT: Now you get a sneak attack, go for it.

322
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,838
SAM: Cool.

323
00:21:17,838 --> 00:21:19,233
LAURA: Did you find it?

324
00:21:19,233 --> 00:21:24,020
MARISHA: I did! It was nowhere it should have
been.

325
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,657
SAM: 11 points. Not very good rolls.

326
00:21:26,657 --> 00:21:28,118
TRAVIS: Which one are you aiming at?

327
00:21:28,118 --> 00:21:29,313
MATT: Not bad, either.

328
00:21:29,313 --> 00:21:30,908
SAM: The one that's holding the child.

329
00:21:30,908 --> 00:21:35,871
MATT: As it's holding the child and it's looking
down at the young boy, lifting it off the ground

330
00:21:35,871 --> 00:21:41,778
and bringing it towards its jaws as its teeth open
wide, its lips curl back like it's ready to take a

331
00:21:41,778 --> 00:21:47,327
quick little nibble of the child's arm. Suddenly
the bolt hits it in the side of the jaw and it's

332
00:21:47,327 --> 00:21:52,974
sticking out. (squeal, snarl) It starts looking
over in your direction and it looks right towards

333
00:21:52,974 --> 00:21:55,367
you. (growl)

334
00:21:55,367 --> 00:22:02,513
SAM: Can I use my regular-- regular gnoll. Do I
have remaining movement as a bonus?

335
00:22:02,513 --> 00:22:05,157
MATT: No, it's your full movement to get there.
Bonus action you can dash if you want to.

336
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:10,452
SAM: Yes. I will dash away, but I can't hide. I
will dash behind those rocks to my right.

337
00:22:10,452 --> 00:22:11,142
MATT: Over here?

338
00:22:11,142 --> 00:22:18,496
SAM: Yes. In those skulls or anywhere around
there.

339
00:22:18,496 --> 00:22:23,260
MATT: That works fine there. Beau.

340
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,778
TRAVIS: She can't see shit.

341
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:26,322
LAURA: I'm not Beau.

342
00:22:26,322 --> 00:22:31,318
MATT: Sorry. Beau, you lose your turn. It's been a
long day, I'm sorry. Molly, you're up next.

343
00:22:31,318 --> 00:22:42,151
TALIESIN: I'm going to run straight in, take a
look around. Is the undead one the closest one to

344
00:22:42,151 --> 00:22:43,104
me?

345
00:22:43,104 --> 00:22:44,250
MATT: It is, yes.

346
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,165
TALIESIN: Push me a little more against the wall.

347
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:48,295
MATT: Over here?

348
00:22:48,295 --> 00:22:57,538
TALIESIN: Yeah, over there. I'm going to hit that
undead one with Vicious Mockery. Actually, I'm

349
00:22:57,538 --> 00:23:00,338
going to hit the one that has the kid with Vicious
Mockery, not the undead one.

350
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:04,218
MATT: Okay. Same roll, puts him at a two, natural
roll, so he's affected by it.

351
00:23:04,218 --> 00:23:09,559
TALIESIN: Oh that's right, I don't have to roll to
hit. Just a wisdom saving throw. That's three

352
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:12,387
points of damage.

353
00:23:12,387 --> 00:23:13,911
MATT: All right, and he has disadvantage on his
next attack roll.

354
00:23:13,911 --> 00:23:15,890
TALIESIN: Yes. (rasping) Drop the child!

355
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:16,976
TRAVIS: Jesus Christ.

356
00:23:16,976 --> 00:23:18,711
TALIESIN: Get used to it.

357
00:23:18,711 --> 00:23:23,036
MATT: The skeletal gnoll turns to you (cracking).
It seems to hear it and there's something about

358
00:23:23,036 --> 00:23:28,629
the speech and the connection to this entity that
cause it to shudder for a moment. That ends your

359
00:23:28,629 --> 00:23:29,407
turn?

360
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:30,915
TALIESIN: Yep. I'm holding waiting for them.

361
00:23:30,915 --> 00:23:37,635
MATT: Next up is Beau. Wait, no. Sorry. That's my
problem, I wrote Beau twice on this.

362
00:23:37,635 --> 00:23:40,781
TRAVIS: I'm the only other one that can see.

363
00:23:40,781 --> 00:23:43,159
LAURA: I'm Beau number two!

364
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:45,257
MATT: Jester and then you.

365
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:51,403
LAURA: I lied! I am not going to do the Sacred
Flame, I'm going to do Toll the Dead because

366
00:23:51,403 --> 00:23:53,147
that's a wisdom saving throw.

367
00:23:53,147 --> 00:23:55,682
MATT: Okay! Toll the Dead to which one?

368
00:23:55,682 --> 00:23:57,607
LAURA: To the one holding the kid.

369
00:23:57,607 --> 00:24:01,458
MATT: All righty. Constitution saving throw?

370
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:03,666
LAURA: That's a wisdom saving throw.

371
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:06,201
MATT: That is going to put him at a 15.

372
00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:07,478
LAURA: Aw, he saves.

373
00:24:07,478 --> 00:24:13,831
MATT: Sorry. As it seems to ring within its head,
the impact of the necromantic magic, currently

374
00:24:13,831 --> 00:24:18,775
still reeling from the pain in the throat from the
bolt, it seems to shrug it off, unaffected. Then

375
00:24:18,775 --> 00:24:20,634
Fjord, you're up.

376
00:24:20,634 --> 00:24:23,670
LAURA: (rasping) Next time I'm going to really
hurt you! I said that in Infernal.

377
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,924
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah!

378
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:29,804
TRAVIS: Which one of them is the undead looking
gnoll?

379
00:24:29,804 --> 00:24:30,713
MATT: Right there.

380
00:24:30,713 --> 00:24:35,331
TRAVIS: That guy. I would like to aim at the dude
on the right, the one closest to you, and I will

381
00:24:35,331 --> 00:24:41,238
carry over my Hex that is still up since it lasts
an hour, so for my bonus action I will cast Hex on

382
00:24:41,312 --> 00:24:42,586
that motherfuck.

383
00:24:42,586 --> 00:24:44,120
MATT: All righty.

384
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,491
TRAVIS: I would like to use Eldritch Blast.

385
00:24:46,491 --> 00:24:48,447
MATT: Go for it. Roll for the attack.

386
00:24:49,147 --> 00:24:51,555
TRAVIS: Plus six, that's a 20.

387
00:24:51,555 --> 00:24:53,262
MATT: Yeah, that hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

388
00:24:53,262 --> 00:25:05,305
TRAVIS: Nice. This is a 1d10 plus four. That's 11
plus five points of necrotic damage for 16 total.

389
00:25:05,305 --> 00:25:12,865
MATT: 16 points of damage, all right. As it's
standing on this upper portion of the rock floor,

390
00:25:12,865 --> 00:25:18,335
it glances back as you guys enter. You guys see a
flash of light from the arcing of the arcane

391
00:25:18,335 --> 00:25:23,063
energy as it streaks across and slams into its
body just in time to see another shadowed shape

392
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:33,747
emerging out of this tunnel to join the fray. As
it falls back (snarling, chattering). That's going

393
00:25:33,747 --> 00:25:39,207
to end the initial round of combat. Now we're into
the initiative order. At the top of this, you guys

394
00:25:39,207 --> 00:25:44,448
glance over and the four of you, at least, see
this shape begin to emerge from around the wall.

395
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:50,181
You see this tall, spindly humanoid figure that
begins to curve around the side. Khary, if you

396
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:51,482
want to join the table.

397
00:25:51,482 --> 00:25:53,543
(cheering)

398
00:25:53,543 --> 00:25:56,286
TRAVIS: Spindly, what?

399
00:25:56,286 --> 00:25:59,352
MATT: If I can have you roll initiative when you
get settled in there.

400
00:25:59,352 --> 00:26:02,292
TRAVIS: Oh, man, I don't even know what that
means!

401
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:04,487
LAURA: I've got to see this dice as you roll it.

402
00:26:04,487 --> 00:26:06,668
MARISHA: Do you want a dice tray, Khary? We have
an extra one down here.

403
00:26:06,668 --> 00:26:08,210
KHARY: Oh my goodness, look at this!

404
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:09,690
MARISHA: Look at that.

405
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,020
TRAVIS: The luxurious life.

406
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,564
LIAM: Welcome, friend! Welcome!

407
00:26:12,564 --> 00:26:15,608
KHARY: This is the first time this dice has been
rolled, ladies and gentlemen.

408
00:26:15,608 --> 00:26:16,545
TRAVIS: Do it.

409
00:26:16,545 --> 00:26:17,894
MARISHA: It's a christening roll!

410
00:26:17,894 --> 00:26:19,628
LIAM: It's a one!

411
00:26:19,628 --> 00:26:20,904
KHARY: It's a one?

412
00:26:20,904 --> 00:26:22,982
TRAVIS: Welcome! Welcome!

413
00:26:22,982 --> 00:26:25,922
LIAM: One of us! One of us!

414
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:29,532
[laughing]

415
00:26:29,532 --> 00:26:33,901
KHARY: Thanks for having me, guys. I'll just be
taking this.

416
00:26:34,046 --> 00:26:36,147
LIAM: Storytelling!

417
00:26:36,147 --> 00:26:38,568
LAURA: You weren't even rolling those dice?

418
00:26:38,568 --> 00:26:41,378
KHARY: Yes. All right, here we go.

419
00:26:41,378 --> 00:26:51,895
MATT: You, having succeeded at some of your other
business, begin to creep further into these

420
00:26:51,895 --> 00:26:59,201
tunnels and suddenly see a cluster of unidentified
individuals rushing in here and attacking these

421
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:05,586
gnolls in front of you and the surprise of it
apparently puts you off for the moment.

422
00:27:05,586 --> 00:27:08,426
KHARY: Just a little.

423
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:11,641
MATT: We'll come to you in just a moment. Good to
know. At the top of the combat round, Nott, you're

424
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:12,872
up first.

425
00:27:12,872 --> 00:27:15,113
SAM: That was it? We cycled through a whole round
of combat?

426
00:27:15,113 --> 00:27:20,102
MATT: The surprise round. The humans can't see
anything, unfortunately. Everything you'll be

427
00:27:20,102 --> 00:27:22,585
doing will be at disadvantage after this point.

428
00:27:22,585 --> 00:27:28,511
SAM: I'll have to move. I'll lean around to get
around that stalagtite.

429
00:27:28,511 --> 00:27:30,225
MATT: Around here?

430
00:27:30,225 --> 00:27:32,880
SAM: No, just so I can get an eyeline on the one I
already shot once.

431
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:34,089
MATT: Back over here?

432
00:27:34,089 --> 00:27:40,596
SAM: Yeah. Anywhere. I'm going to move right back
in a second. I'll lean around, reload. Oh, god!

433
00:27:40,596 --> 00:27:41,991
Fire again.

434
00:27:41,991 --> 00:27:43,420
MATT: Go for it.

435
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:46,729
SAM: Do I get sneak attack? No, right?

436
00:27:46,729 --> 00:27:47,778
MATT: No, because you're not hidden.

437
00:27:47,778 --> 00:27:49,833
SAM: Shitballs. 20 to hit.

438
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:51,577
MATT: 20 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

439
00:27:51,577 --> 00:27:53,677
SAM: Eight.

440
00:27:53,677 --> 00:28:01,210
MATT: Eight points of damage. That'll do it,
actually. As it's holding the child and lifting it

441
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:05,518
up by the arm in the air, it looks like it's ready
to run away and grab it with it. As it turns to

442
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:10,546
flee, you catch it in the base of the skull and it
falls to the ground. The child falls prone onto

443
00:28:10,546 --> 00:28:15,527
the floor next to the now lifeless gnoll body.

444
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:21,005
SAM: What does the child look like? He or she?
It's a boy?

445
00:28:21,005 --> 00:28:24,339
MATT: It looks to be a young boy, probably between
six and eight years old. You're not quite sure of

446
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:25,306
the age.

447
00:28:25,306 --> 00:28:27,225
SAM: And human, I don't know anything about. Is it
injured?

448
00:28:27,225 --> 00:28:31,361
MATT: You haven't got a strong bead on it but he
looks to be humanoid.

449
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:32,633
MARISHA: Six or eight years old?

450
00:28:32,633 --> 00:28:33,961
MATT: Around that age group, you'd assume.

451
00:28:33,961 --> 00:28:36,137
TALIESIN: Some would say seven.

452
00:28:36,137 --> 00:28:39,038
LAURA: Yes! The field is ours now!

453
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:49,333
SAM: No! I'm too scared to go over there. No,
there's a child in need. We've got to help.

454
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:51,132
TRAVIS: You're sober now, right?

455
00:28:51,132 --> 00:28:55,827
SAM: Yeah. Nott's going to scurry over to the boy
as fast as she can scurry.

456
00:28:55,827 --> 00:29:00,651
MATT: 30, and then you can use your bonus action
to dash if you want to.

457
00:29:00,651 --> 00:29:02,541
SAM: Yep, all the way to the little boy.

458
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:05,181
MATT: That'll do it. You can get right to the
little boy.

459
00:29:05,181 --> 00:29:06,899
SAM: (screech)

460
00:29:06,899 --> 00:29:10,994
MATT: As you run up, the little boy's like,
(screaming) Just starts screaming bloody murder in

461
00:29:10,994 --> 00:29:12,993
the tunnel.

462
00:29:12,993 --> 00:29:14,992
[laughing]

463
00:29:14,992 --> 00:29:16,992
SAM: I'm good! I'm a good one! I'm good!

464
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:23,015
MATT: (screaming) He starts crying even louder,
somehow scared of you more than the gnoll.

465
00:29:26,795 --> 00:29:28,635
[screaming]

466
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,680
LAURA: Now it's a horror movie.

467
00:29:32,818 --> 00:29:37,498
MATT: That's your turn, Nott. Beau, you're up.
You're hearing all these sounds, but you can't see

468
00:29:37,498 --> 00:29:39,034
anything.

469
00:29:39,034 --> 00:29:46,691
MARISHA: I'm going to turn to Caleb and be like:
Can you do the thing? The lights?

470
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:49,731
LIAM: Get back to me in a second, in about nine
seconds.

471
00:29:49,731 --> 00:29:53,207
MARISHA: I'm going to wait until he casts Dancing
Lights.

472
00:29:53,207 --> 00:29:56,593
MATT: You can't move in there if you hold your
action, but you can move in and then hold your

473
00:29:56,593 --> 00:29:59,924
action if you want to. You're just not quite sure
where you're walking.

474
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:07,708
MARISHA: Okay. Sure. I will stumble forward. I
will head towards Molly because I'm going to

475
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:09,512
follow his fluorescent purple coat.

476
00:30:09,512 --> 00:30:11,032
TRAVIS: Just doing this?

477
00:30:11,032 --> 00:30:13,141
MARISHA: Molly! Molly!

478
00:30:13,141 --> 00:30:17,490
MATT: He's easy to see because Molly has this
faint, luminous glow around the sword from his

479
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:21,376
right. You see that as a beacon. You're like,
"That I know, that I can follow." You cozy up

480
00:30:21,376 --> 00:30:24,456
right next to Molly and carefully prepare
yourself.

481
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:25,898
MARISHA: Where are they?

482
00:30:25,898 --> 00:30:28,816
MATT: What action are you holding? If any.

483
00:30:28,816 --> 00:30:34,770
MARISHA: I-- Because I moved and I'm not near
anything.

484
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:35,603
MATT: Correct.

485
00:30:35,603 --> 00:30:37,168
MARISHA: So I'll take the Dodge action.

486
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,947
MATT: Okay. Dodge action. You're just being
careful. All right, ending Beau's turn, Molly,

487
00:30:39,947 --> 00:30:41,527
you're up again.

488
00:30:41,527 --> 00:30:42,763
TALIESIN: I'm going to rush the undead one.

489
00:30:42,763 --> 00:30:43,986
MATT: Okay.

490
00:30:43,986 --> 00:30:48,676
TALIESIN: Spinning swords at bloody high speed and
take two shots.

491
00:30:48,676 --> 00:30:53,005
MATT: Go for it. Do you want to be on the higher
ground here or--?

492
00:30:53,005 --> 00:30:54,251
TALIESIN: Ooh! Can I do the higher ground?

493
00:30:54,251 --> 00:30:55,044
MATT: Yeah, you can.

494
00:30:55,044 --> 00:30:56,905
TALIESIN: I'll do the higher ground. That's
exciting.

495
00:30:56,905 --> 00:30:59,217
LIAM: Now taking the stage, it's Mollymauk!

496
00:30:59,217 --> 00:31:03,524
TALIESIN: That sucks! I'm taking your--

497
00:31:03,524 --> 00:31:05,647
LAURA: I was trying to help!

498
00:31:05,647 --> 00:31:06,904
TALIESIN: Nope!

499
00:31:06,904 --> 00:31:08,468
MATT: And your off-hand?

500
00:31:08,468 --> 00:31:09,586
TALIESIN: That's a 15.

501
00:31:09,586 --> 00:31:10,703
MATT: 15 does hit.

502
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:18,518
TALIESIN: Okay. Yep. No. That's at least eight
points of damage.

503
00:31:18,518 --> 00:31:19,427
LAURA: That's great!

504
00:31:19,427 --> 00:31:24,656
TALIESIN: That's okay. That's okay. I'm now
engaged in combat with him, so that's fine. I am

505
00:31:24,656 --> 00:31:27,198
whirling dervish that hits nothing at this point.

506
00:31:27,198 --> 00:31:28,545
SAM: As per usual.

507
00:31:28,545 --> 00:31:40,424
TALIESIN: I'm a hippie with poi right now. Might
as well be a pair of pois. Wah! Wah!

508
00:31:40,424 --> 00:31:42,116
MATT: Good to know. End of Molly's turn, Jester,
you're up.

509
00:31:42,116 --> 00:31:50,857
LAURA: Oh! Okay. I'm going to move forward into
the room. To about, yeah, there's good, sure. I'm

510
00:31:50,857 --> 00:31:56,971
going to try it again. Did the guy up there get
hurt at all?

511
00:31:56,971 --> 00:31:58,714
MATT: Yeah, he's been damaged, yes.

512
00:31:58,714 --> 00:32:01,894
LAURA: Yes? Then I'm going to cast Toll the Dead
at him.

513
00:32:01,894 --> 00:32:03,788
MATT: All right. That is a 14.

514
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:06,450
LAURA: Fucking A, piece of shit!

515
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,160
TRAVIS: What's the save?

516
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,542
LAURA: It's 13 because I'm lame!

517
00:32:11,542 --> 00:32:17,435
MATT: Sorry. As you try and release the energy
once more, it can't quite get a bead on the

518
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,454
gnoll's head. It's moving around and dodging and
you can't focus on it.

519
00:32:20,454 --> 00:32:23,654
LAURA: I'm going to start unsnapping my sickle to
get it out to hit things.

520
00:32:23,654 --> 00:32:27,658
MATT: Okay. As you're fussing with this side,
that's the end of your turn. All right. Caleb,

521
00:32:27,658 --> 00:32:29,032
you're up.

522
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:35,890
LIAM: I cannot see anything, so I cast Dancing
Lights. I put one above my head and as soon as I

523
00:32:35,937 --> 00:32:41,518
get a little bit of light, I send one over Beau's
head and then I send one about 20 feet beyond Beau

524
00:32:41,518 --> 00:32:46,167
and then the fourth one, even beyond that one so
there's a line of four lights because I don't know

525
00:32:46,167 --> 00:32:47,656
what the chamber is shaped like.

526
00:32:47,656 --> 00:32:52,005
MATT: The chamber erupts into bright light like
there's four torches now lifting brightly at the

527
00:32:52,005 --> 00:32:52,890
entire space.

528
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:53,987
TRAVIS: Ah, god!

529
00:32:53,987 --> 00:32:58,592
MATT: Bright visuals there, you can now see the
child on the ground being scared shitless by the

530
00:32:58,592 --> 00:33:04,460
goblin trying to help. The undead gnoll that's
currently locked in combat with Molly. You see the

531
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:08,409
two hyenas that are both snarling and getting
ready to pounce on whoever comes too close. The

532
00:33:08,409 --> 00:33:11,838
one wounded gnoll over there. As well as, if you'd
like to describe yourself.

533
00:33:11,838 --> 00:33:13,935
(exclamations of excitement)

534
00:33:13,935 --> 00:33:15,423
SAM: Where is he?

535
00:33:15,423 --> 00:33:22,541
LIAM: You know, Matthew, the guiding lights, those
little '"foomphs" of light, they only have a

536
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:28,000
10-foot radius, so probably the edges of the line
that I have cast just barely makes it flame.

537
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,542
MARISHA: They're like market lights so it's
pretty. Yeah.

538
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:36,041
LIAM: Of course. It is, of course, pretty. Never
mind, just continue.

539
00:33:36,041 --> 00:33:37,015
MATT: Yes. So.

540
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:41,721
KHARY: The thing you probably notice about me,
first of all--

541
00:33:41,721 --> 00:33:44,381
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (high-pitched) Ooh!

542
00:33:44,381 --> 00:33:47,511
SAM: No. You can't have a better accent than all
of us.

543
00:33:47,511 --> 00:33:54,398
KHARY: --is my hair. My billowy, white afro.

544
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:56,210
TRAVIS: Yes!

545
00:33:56,210 --> 00:34:01,012
KHARY: Fingers of curly hair radiating in all
directions. That should be the thing that you

546
00:34:01,012 --> 00:34:08,471
notice first about me but that's not it. It's my
eyes. My eyes, as white as my hair. My pupil-less

547
00:34:08,471 --> 00:34:15,187
eyes as white as my hair. As white as the hair
dripping down from my chin to a straight point

548
00:34:15,187 --> 00:34:20,392
about three or four inches below. I think that's
all you really notice.

549
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,956
TRAVIS: Shit!

550
00:34:22,956 --> 00:34:24,532
MATT: Caleb, do you wish to move?

551
00:34:24,532 --> 00:34:25,945
MARISHA: I'm in love. What?

552
00:34:25,945 --> 00:34:27,281
MATT: Caleb, do you wish to move?

553
00:34:27,281 --> 00:34:28,141
MARISHA: Oh!

554
00:34:28,141 --> 00:34:31,475
LIAM: Oh. Fuck that. I will stay where I am. No,
thank you.

555
00:34:31,496 --> 00:34:42,761
MATT: All right. Fjord and the gnoll going at the
same time. What are you doing?

556
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:45,669
TRAVIS: Eldritch Blast again at that motherfuck.

557
00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:51,329
MATT: As this gnoll here has taken the impact is
going to rush over towards Mollymauk to attempt to

558
00:34:51,329 --> 00:35:00,811
take a strike. While another gnoll who's bloodied
and partially crushed is now hobbling its way up

559
00:35:00,811 --> 00:35:07,755
out of this tunnel and spins around to see you up
against the side of the wall (growls and yips).

560
00:35:07,755 --> 00:35:09,686
All right, Fjord?

561
00:35:09,686 --> 00:35:12,147
TRAVIS: 16 plus six, so 22?

562
00:35:12,147 --> 00:35:17,225
MATT: That hits. The gnoll's going to be striking
you. That's a three, that's not going to happen.

563
00:35:17,225 --> 00:35:18,271
No.

564
00:35:18,271 --> 00:35:25,201
TRAVIS: Eight plus four is 12 plus four points of
necrotic for 16 total points of damage.

565
00:35:25,201 --> 00:35:30,535
MATT: All right. The reason it misses is right as
it swings towards you, Fjord raises the back of

566
00:35:30,535 --> 00:35:34,359
the sword and fires a blast of eldritch energy
that hits the back of the gnoll's shoulder as it

567
00:35:34,359 --> 00:35:38,605
tries to spin and strike you. As it does, it goes
wide. It pirouettes on its foot and stumbles back

568
00:35:38,605 --> 00:35:44,023
into the open hole. (high-pitched yell)

569
00:35:44,023 --> 00:35:48,910
TRAVIS: Oh, there's an open fucking hole?! That's
good to know! Oh, shit!

570
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:49,877
MATT: Yeah!

571
00:35:49,877 --> 00:35:54,416
LIAM: Did you hear the sound go (high-pitched
yell)? So it's not ten feet, it's big.

572
00:35:54,416 --> 00:35:58,257
TRAVIS: Okay. Good to know! Fuck.

573
00:35:58,257 --> 00:36:00,036
MATT: You're a ways away. It's hard to see.

574
00:36:00,036 --> 00:36:01,155
TRAVIS: Yeah. Uh-huh.

575
00:36:01,155 --> 00:36:06,437
MATT: Described your initial description of the
room, though, so now you know. As you, who has not

576
00:36:06,437 --> 00:36:10,389
given your name yet, but you turn around and see
this gnoll as it looks towards you. It's leaning

577
00:36:10,389 --> 00:36:15,641
towards-- normally, it would be seven-foot, but
it's hunched and wounded and as it turns down, it

578
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:22,694
snarls. Takes its spear and attempts to pin you to
the wall a bit. That's going to be a 12. What's

579
00:36:22,694 --> 00:36:24,448
your armor class?

580
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:29,463
KHARY: My armor class is-- what is it? It's 15.

581
00:36:29,622 --> 00:36:30,748
MATT: 15? It does not hit.

582
00:36:30,748 --> 00:36:31,750
TRAVIS: Yeah!

583
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:35,644
MATT: As it swings, you push out of the way in
time, parrying it with your hand and your cane off

584
00:36:35,644 --> 00:36:41,301
to the side and it smacks into the stone and
sparks off of it for a second, hitting flint. All

585
00:36:41,301 --> 00:36:46,600
right, that ends the gnolls' turn. The hyenas go.
Both of these hyenas now, turning around and

586
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,075
seeing what's happening are going to rush forward.
This one is going to run up alongside and attack

587
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:52,705
Molly. This one is going to rush over to Nott.

588
00:36:52,705 --> 00:36:53,779
LAURA: Oh no.

589
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:57,838
MATT: Attacking Molly, that's going to be a 16 to
hit?

590
00:36:57,838 --> 00:36:58,576
TALIESIN: That hits.

591
00:36:58,576 --> 00:37:01,781
MATT: All right. It's going to be--

592
00:37:01,781 --> 00:37:04,070
TRAVIS: Dance harder, dance harder!

593
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:08,091
MATT: --two points of piercing damage. As it snaps
up and bites the edge of your foot, you have to

594
00:37:08,148 --> 00:37:13,204
kick and shake it off on the rocks to get it to
let go. The one that's striking towards you, Nott,

595
00:37:13,204 --> 00:37:16,202
that's going to be an 18 to hit?

596
00:37:16,202 --> 00:37:17,444
SAM: Hits!

597
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:22,322
MATT: You take only one point of piercing damage.
It gets one little bite on the side of your elbow

598
00:37:22,322 --> 00:37:26,528
and you immediately pull away and kick it
instinctually in the chin, going (yelps). The kid

599
00:37:26,528 --> 00:37:29,839
is now freaking out of his mind as now there's,
from his perspective, two snarling beasts

600
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:34,846
cornering in. That's going to end the hyenas'
turn. All right. Your go.

601
00:37:36,016 --> 00:37:40,872
KHARY: I would say, if this thing is this close to
me.

602
00:37:40,933 --> 00:37:42,356
MATT: Yeah, it's right up against you.

603
00:37:42,356 --> 00:37:44,652
KHARY: It's right up against me. I think I should
push him away.

604
00:37:44,652 --> 00:37:46,466
MATT: If you feel the need, yeah.

605
00:37:46,466 --> 00:37:48,002
KHARY: Let's see. Thunderwave?

606
00:37:48,002 --> 00:37:49,164
MATT: Certainly!

607
00:37:49,164 --> 00:37:51,818
SAM: Skadoosh.

608
00:37:51,818 --> 00:37:54,489
MATT: Is that a wisdom saving throw or
constitution--?

609
00:37:54,489 --> 00:37:55,934
LIAM: It's a constitution save.

610
00:37:55,934 --> 00:37:57,497
KHARY: That is a constitution save.

611
00:37:57,497 --> 00:38:02,849
MATT: That is a three. A natural two plus,
actually plus zero. So two.

612
00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:04,921
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, that fails.

613
00:38:04,921 --> 00:38:05,975
MATT: Yeah, that fails.

614
00:38:05,975 --> 00:38:07,519
SAM: Your spellcasting modifier--

615
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:08,684
TRAVIS: He rolled a two, you're fine.

616
00:38:08,684 --> 00:38:10,129
LIAM: 15!

617
00:38:10,129 --> 00:38:12,929
KHARY: 15. It failed. Ah. Well, great.

618
00:38:12,929 --> 00:38:17,772
MATT: 13, I believe. All right, cool. Go ahead and
roll the damage of that.

619
00:38:17,772 --> 00:38:20,381
KHARY: With this?

620
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,212
MATT: Well, it should say it on the spell there.

621
00:38:22,212 --> 00:38:23,869
MARISHA: I think it's 2d8?

622
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:33,750
LIAM: Thunderwave is 2d8. Yeah. 2d8 there. You
want the one that's shaped like a diamond. Here it

623
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:39,608
is. Yeah. That's good and then roll one more time.
Oh, that's good!

624
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,311
KHARY: Five and seven?

625
00:38:41,311 --> 00:38:43,096
TRAVIS: 12. Damn!

626
00:38:43,096 --> 00:38:48,878
MATT: 12 points of damage! As you turn towards it,
describe what you do with your spell as the gnoll

627
00:38:48,878 --> 00:38:50,018
pulls back with its spear.

628
00:38:50,018 --> 00:38:58,116
KHARY: I take my reed of a wand and whip it. Three
times.

629
00:38:58,116 --> 00:39:03,805
MATT: (whipping sounds) As the third one hits,
there's a burst of energy forward. You watch as

630
00:39:03,805 --> 00:39:08,934
the gnoll gets blown back, slamming into the stone
wall and falls back to its knees before getting

631
00:39:08,934 --> 00:39:12,890
itself up. It was previously wounded, now it's on
death's door. It looks like it's starting to

632
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:14,781
hobble and try and flee.

633
00:39:14,781 --> 00:39:18,003
TRAVIS: Would you say you whip your reed back and
forth? You whip your reed back and forth?

634
00:39:18,003 --> 00:39:20,480
KHARY: I do. I whip my reed. I whip my reed back
and forth.

635
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,503
MATT: Do you wish to move?

636
00:39:23,503 --> 00:39:32,126
KHARY: I do. I wish to move away from this
gentleman that I just knocked against a wall and

637
00:39:32,126 --> 00:39:38,150
how about we take a perch on top of-- there we go,
baby.

638
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:41,110
LIAM: Oh, look at that fucking miniature!

639
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,209
MARISHA and LAURA: So cool!

640
00:39:43,209 --> 00:39:47,336
MATT: That finishes your turn. At the top, Nott,
you're up.

641
00:39:47,336 --> 00:39:54,899
SAM: Okay, I've got this thing on my arm? So with
my other hand, I will (high-pitched whimpering)

642
00:39:54,899 --> 00:40:00,334
grab its face (normal voice) and I will say a few
a words that Caleb told me and cast Shocking Grasp

643
00:40:00,334 --> 00:40:01,740
on it!

644
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:05,340
MATT: Okay! What is the spell save on that?

645
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:09,039
SAM: Shit, how do I find out? You click on it.

646
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:11,900
MATT: Oh, it's a spell melee attack. So go and
roll--

647
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:15,242
SAM: Ooh! Nine.

648
00:40:15,242 --> 00:40:22,861
MATT: No. You try and reach out, but the snout is
too slobbery and your hand slips off of it and it

649
00:40:22,861 --> 00:40:24,648
discharges the spell having no effect.

650
00:40:24,648 --> 00:40:25,557
SAM: (yelps)

651
00:40:25,557 --> 00:40:26,889
MATT: (yips)

652
00:40:26,889 --> 00:40:27,894
SAM: Oh, god.

653
00:40:27,894 --> 00:40:29,152
MATT: All right.

654
00:40:29,152 --> 00:40:33,310
SAM: Let's see here. I've still got some bonus-y
stuff. Can I disengage? No, because--

655
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:34,149
MATT: Yeah.

656
00:40:34,149 --> 00:40:40,701
SAM: Okay. I'll disengage, grab the boy, and try
to lead him behind the-- there's an overturned

657
00:40:40,701 --> 00:40:41,923
table?

658
00:40:41,923 --> 00:40:46,747
MATT: There is an overturned table. Yeah, these
are overturned tables over here.

659
00:40:46,747 --> 00:40:47,938
SAM: Like right there.

660
00:40:47,938 --> 00:40:49,806
MATT: Oh, right next to you. Yeah, you're right.
Right there.

661
00:40:49,806 --> 00:40:50,971
SAM: Can I do that?

662
00:40:50,971 --> 00:40:52,346
MATT: You can, yeah.

663
00:40:52,346 --> 00:40:54,194
LAURA: Will the hyena get a bite on the kid?

664
00:40:54,194 --> 00:40:55,454
SAM: We'll find out.

665
00:40:55,454 --> 00:41:00,634
MATT: As you drag the child away, while you've
disengaged, you pull the child out of the range of

666
00:41:00,634 --> 00:41:02,639
the hyena and it sees the opening and snaps out
towards--

667
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:04,319
LAURA: Children have no hit points!

668
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:05,859
SAM: I'm sure this one is hardy.

669
00:41:05,859 --> 00:41:09,454
MATT: (chuckles)

670
00:41:09,454 --> 00:41:11,114
LIAM: (singing) Careful, the kids you pull.

671
00:41:11,114 --> 00:41:13,432
LAURA: (singing) Hyenas will bite them.

672
00:41:13,432 --> 00:41:20,777
MATT: The hyena bites down and its jaws clamp into
the child's clavicle and chest. You hear this

673
00:41:20,777 --> 00:41:25,345
clenched scream that's immediately muffled as you
watch a bit of blood begin to pour out of the side

674
00:41:25,345 --> 00:41:33,232
of his mouth. As you pull the child from its jaws,
the child is alive. For now. Unconscious and

675
00:41:33,232 --> 00:41:34,880
bleeding out.

676
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,617
(groaning)

677
00:41:36,617 --> 00:41:37,951
MARISHA: Thank god it wasn't me this time.

678
00:41:38,891 --> 00:41:41,843
MATT: That ends your turn, Nott. Beau, you're up.

679
00:41:42,023 --> 00:41:47,526
MARISHA: Okay, seeing the situation that Nott is
in, I'm going to immediately run over and attack

680
00:41:47,526 --> 00:41:49,590
that hyena.

681
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,640
MATT: Putting you there easy enough.

682
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,478
MARISHA: I'm just going to run up and go, "Yeah,
get!" Go kick and just kick it real hard.

683
00:41:55,478 --> 00:41:56,705
TRAVIS: G-I-T.

684
00:41:56,705 --> 00:41:58,176
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Git!

685
00:41:59,186 --> 00:42:00,194
MARISHA: Natural 20.

686
00:42:00,266 --> 00:42:01,594
TRAVIS: That it is.

687
00:42:01,594 --> 00:42:04,101
MATT: Roll some damage.

688
00:42:04,101 --> 00:42:10,732
MARISHA: I use my staff as a little bit like a
jumping leverage point to give me a little bit of

689
00:42:10,732 --> 00:42:12,068
momentum and--

690
00:42:12,068 --> 00:42:14,026
TRAVIS: Mini pole-vaulting?

691
00:42:14,026 --> 00:42:20,494
MARISHA: Yeah. What do I do? I roll 1d8 and then
double it. That sucks, but that's six plus four,

692
00:42:20,494 --> 00:42:21,275
so ten.

693
00:42:21,275 --> 00:42:26,879
MATT: That's enough to do it. As you kick, the
hyena gets launched and arc through the air,

694
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:30,606
slamming into this table which busts it up against
the wall onto its side and you can't even see the

695
00:42:30,606 --> 00:42:36,103
lifeless body of the hyena. It's currently buried
beneath the overturned table. That's your first--

696
00:42:36,103 --> 00:42:40,275
MARISHA: Can I do a bonus action to use my med kit
on the kid? My healer's kit?

697
00:42:40,275 --> 00:42:44,503
MATT: It's an action to use a healer's kit,
unfortunately. You still have some movement.

698
00:42:44,503 --> 00:42:47,985
MARISHA: I'll just move over to the kid and hold
the wound.

699
00:42:47,985 --> 00:42:49,097
TRAVIS: Stem the flow?

700
00:42:49,097 --> 00:42:50,244
MARISHA: Yeah.

701
00:42:50,244 --> 00:42:53,058
MATT: Okay, so you get down with Nott at this
point and you're trying to think of some way to

702
00:42:53,257 --> 00:42:57,698
apply pressure to prevent the bleeding. Okay, that
ends your turn. That brings us to Molly.

703
00:42:57,698 --> 00:43:01,704
TALIESIN: I'm taking a roll at the big guy. First
strike.

704
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:06,134
MATT: That's right, I forgot to put the undead guy
on the initiative order which he would have gotten

705
00:43:06,134 --> 00:43:09,626
a round. We'll say you and him go simultaneously
at this point since you engaged him.

706
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:13,780
TALIESIN: That's fine because that's a 19 to hit?

707
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,459
MATT: That's a 13 to hit you. What's your armor
class?

708
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:16,361
TALIESIN: 15.

709
00:43:16,361 --> 00:43:22,365
MATT: Yeah, even as it goes to strike at you with
some sort of rusted battleaxe, you still manage to

710
00:43:22,365 --> 00:43:25,114
lift your foot out of the way and strike down
towards it.

711
00:43:25,114 --> 00:43:33,089
TALIESIN: This is with the good sword, so this--
ooh, so this is (counting) 13 points of damage?

712
00:43:33,089 --> 00:43:34,132
MATT: That's adding your wisdom modifier?

713
00:43:34,132 --> 00:43:35,315
TALIESIN: That's adding my wisdom.

714
00:43:35,315 --> 00:43:40,778
MATT: That'll do it. You shatter it with a strike.
As it attempts to swing towards you with the axe,

715
00:43:40,778 --> 00:43:45,995
you duck out of the way, spin around, and backhand
it with your right enchanted scimitar, watching

716
00:43:45,995 --> 00:43:49,948
the bones (boom) explode and scatter across the
ground. Like so many pebbles being thrown across

717
00:43:49,948 --> 00:43:51,286
the floor.

718
00:43:51,286 --> 00:43:55,608
TALIESIN: With my off-hand, I'm going to take a
swipe for the hyena over there.

719
00:43:55,608 --> 00:43:56,933
MATT: Go for it.

720
00:43:56,933 --> 00:43:59,466
TALIESIN: Come on. There we go! 20 to hit.

721
00:43:59,466 --> 00:44:00,639
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

722
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,694
TRAVIS: It's good to dispatch two in one turn.

723
00:44:02,694 --> 00:44:03,810
LAURA: Yes!

724
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:06,850
TALIESIN: That's nine points of damage. I would
love to just kick that fucker right into the--

725
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:07,798
MATT: Yeah, you do.

726
00:44:07,798 --> 00:44:09,208
TRAVIS: Yeah!

727
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:15,887
MATT: It gets down and jumps to pounce towards you
and you lean back and kick it and it tumbles down

728
00:44:15,887 --> 00:44:19,415
to the darkness below. You wish to move?

729
00:44:19,415 --> 00:44:24,252
TALIESIN: I'm going to move to the other side. I'm
going to start running towards the stranger just

730
00:44:24,252 --> 00:44:27,506
to the left of-- yeah, I'm going to move towards
that cover right there.

731
00:44:27,506 --> 00:44:28,122
MATT: Here?

732
00:44:28,122 --> 00:44:29,797
TALIESIN: No, the other way. Towards me. Right
there, yeah.

733
00:44:29,797 --> 00:44:34,255
MATT: Gotcha. That ends your go, Molly. That
brings us to Jester.

734
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:37,918
LAURA: Okay. Did I see the child go down?

735
00:44:37,918 --> 00:44:39,321
MATT: You would've, yes.

736
00:44:39,321 --> 00:44:44,722
LAURA: Okay. Then I am going to run over to the
kid.

737
00:44:44,722 --> 00:44:46,829
SAM: You don't have to.

738
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:50,176
Just kill-- the kid's gonna live.

739
00:44:50,176 --> 00:44:54,204
LAURA: No, all these other people are helping this
kid, so I guess I will too. Somebody better kill

740
00:44:54,431 --> 00:44:55,479
that big gnoll, though.

741
00:44:55,479 --> 00:44:56,549
SAM: Do you really care about the kid?

742
00:44:56,549 --> 00:44:57,412
LAURA: I don't.

743
00:44:57,412 --> 00:44:58,451
SAM: Then don't help.

744
00:44:58,451 --> 00:45:00,990
LAURA: I don't care but now I feel guilty.

745
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:03,227
MATT: Are you going to healer's kit, Cure Wounds,
what are you doing?

746
00:45:03,227 --> 00:45:05,009
LAURA: Should I use my last spell on this kid?

747
00:45:05,009 --> 00:45:06,505
SAM: Hells no!

748
00:45:06,505 --> 00:45:10,652
LAURA: I'm going to use a healer's kit to
stabilize him.

749
00:45:10,652 --> 00:45:16,567
MATT: You don't have to make a check for that. You
get down and start pulling heavy rolls of soft

750
00:45:16,567 --> 00:45:22,210
cotton fabric and various balms to help treat the
wound, and help staunch the flow of blood and bind

751
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:24,413
the child to the point where it's no longer on
death's door.

752
00:45:24,413 --> 00:45:27,979
LAURA: The whole time I'm grumbling like: Oh I
could have gotten that last Toll of the Dead! It

753
00:45:27,979 --> 00:45:31,412
would have heard a really good bell and instead
I'm doing <i>this</i>!

754
00:45:31,412 --> 00:45:34,472
(laughter)

755
00:45:36,622 --> 00:45:38,447
MATT: Perfect, that ends Jester's turn. Caleb,
you're up.

756
00:45:39,637 --> 00:45:41,377
SAM: Angry healing.

757
00:45:41,377 --> 00:45:47,843
LIAM: I cannot see anything except for Fjord, so
if I move forward up to where he is, am I able to

758
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:51,480
see any gnolls or any other kind of baddies where
I am?

759
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:56,539
MATT: Right there you can barely see the one
across the way that's on the ground getting up.

760
00:45:56,539 --> 00:46:01,358
LIAM: Then I'll let my hand blacken and I will
fire off a Fire Bolt at him from here. Which I'm

761
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:05,048
sure will miss. Yeah it is. It misses.

762
00:46:05,048 --> 00:46:08,453
(laughter)

763
00:46:08,453 --> 00:46:11,151
TRAVIS: The call before it was clutch!

764
00:46:11,151 --> 00:46:13,150
LAURA: Oh no!

765
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:15,839
LIAM: I turn to Fjord as it misses and say: Eh,
yeah.

766
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,697
(laughter)

767
00:46:22,266 --> 00:46:23,316
MATT: Okay!

768
00:46:23,316 --> 00:46:25,774
TALIESIN: We've got to get you glasses.

769
00:46:25,988 --> 00:46:27,420
LAURA: Oh my god, Caleb needs glasses!

770
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,119
MATT: Caleb needs glasses.

771
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,506
LIAM: I have them, they're right here!

772
00:46:31,506 --> 00:46:33,701
MATT: That ends Caleb's turn.

773
00:46:33,701 --> 00:46:35,095
LAURA: A new prescription!

774
00:46:35,095 --> 00:46:38,526
LIAM: I need an intelligence bump is what I need.
Boomp!

775
00:46:38,526 --> 00:46:41,680
MATT: The gnoll's been wounded. It is going to
take a--

776
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,650
LAURA: Glasses make you smarter.

777
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:47,988
MATT: He's going to take a longbow off its and
looking over and seeing the Fire Bolt that almost

778
00:46:48,022 --> 00:46:52,036
struck it, it's going to spin back towards you and
pull and arrow. It's going to take a shot at you

779
00:46:52,036 --> 00:46:54,249
from across the way, Caleb.

780
00:46:54,294 --> 00:46:56,813
LIAM: What do you mean?

781
00:46:56,813 --> 00:47:00,847
MATT: This one remaining wounded gnoll is going to
take a shot at you with its longbow. Just checking

782
00:47:00,847 --> 00:47:02,272
real fast.

783
00:47:02,272 --> 00:47:04,672
LAURA: Your scarf will protect you!

784
00:47:04,672 --> 00:47:08,488
MATT: Yeah, sure! You're well within its first
range increment.

785
00:47:08,488 --> 00:47:10,686
LIAM: I have a very high AC. It's okay.

786
00:47:10,686 --> 00:47:12,289
MATT: That's a natural 20.

787
00:47:13,478 --> 00:47:15,304
MARISHA: Oh my god!

788
00:47:16,385 --> 00:47:18,301
MATT: However--

789
00:47:18,645 --> 00:47:20,476
SAM: However nothing.

790
00:47:20,476 --> 00:47:22,938
LIAM: Unload it, give it to me!

791
00:47:22,938 --> 00:47:24,632
MARISHA: He's trying to find a positive.

792
00:47:24,632 --> 00:47:26,069
LIAM: No, don't find a positive!

793
00:47:26,069 --> 00:47:28,575
MATT: Oh, that's good actually! He rolled a one on
the weapon die. It was a d8, it could have been a

794
00:47:28,575 --> 00:47:34,682
16. Two plus two, four points of piercing damage.
That could have been a lot worse!

795
00:47:34,682 --> 00:47:36,386
TRAVIS: That's pretty bad for him, though.

796
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:39,672
LIAM: No, actually that hurts an awful lot.

797
00:47:39,672 --> 00:47:45,351
MATT: The gnoll released the arrow. As it hits you
in the stomach, it comes piercing out the other

798
00:47:45,351 --> 00:47:50,896
side, pinning your jacket to you torso. You feel
like the pain and the warm pulse up your back from

799
00:47:50,896 --> 00:47:55,413
the wound. It's almost numb at first and then you
feel the shock hit you as the gnoll turns and runs

800
00:47:55,413 --> 00:47:56,868
this way.

801
00:47:56,868 --> 00:47:59,148
LAURA: Oh no! I should have Tolled the Dead on
him.

802
00:47:59,148 --> 00:48:00,877
MATT: And he's way over there.

803
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:04,656
That's going to ends the gnoll's turn while
you're going Fjord. Because you're going in the

804
00:48:04,656 --> 00:48:07,194
same round as this is happening, so you
technically could intercept.

805
00:48:07,194 --> 00:48:11,317
TRAVIS: I'd like to get line of sight on him. I
look back at Caleb with his failed attempts and

806
00:48:11,483 --> 00:48:17,086
say: Let me try mine. I'll move my Hex over to
him.

807
00:48:17,086 --> 00:48:19,813
MATT: The Hex is on him.

808
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:25,700
TRAVIS: I'll fire an Eldritch Blast in his
direction. That is only a 16.

809
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:31,263
MATT: A 16? 16 hits, actually. You needed a 15 to
hit.

810
00:48:32,083 --> 00:48:39,899
TRAVIS: Four plus four, eight. Plus three points
of necrotic for 11 damage.

811
00:48:39,899 --> 00:48:47,163
MATT: As it turns with its bow, Fjord runs around.
Holding your sword out, another burst of eldritch

812
00:48:47,163 --> 00:48:51,428
energy smacks into the back of the gnoll. You hear
(screeches) as it falls to the ground and slow

813
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:57,311
bits of curling green and blue eldritch flame
begin to burn and consume the corpse before

814
00:48:57,311 --> 00:49:01,678
eventually it goes out, leaving most of the body
intact. Its back shoulder blades now a black cave

815
00:49:01,678 --> 00:49:04,183
where its body once was.

816
00:49:04,183 --> 00:49:07,460
LIAM: You ganked him at the last second?

817
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:11,280
LAURA: Someone bring me those ears and bring them
to my jar!

818
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:20,782
MATT: That being the case, the combat has come to
an end.

819
00:49:20,782 --> 00:49:22,861
LAURA: How many gnolls was that we just killed?

820
00:49:22,861 --> 00:49:24,647
TRAVIS: Three.

821
00:49:24,647 --> 00:49:30,382
LIAM: Well don't we send a lot of them down the
hole. We didn't get their ears. So bad job.

822
00:49:30,382 --> 00:49:33,142
LAURA: We only sent one down the hole.

823
00:49:33,142 --> 00:49:35,369
TRAVIS: We got two ears.

824
00:49:35,369 --> 00:49:40,659
MATT: Correct. They're sets of ears. There's the
one there and then the one that was killed there.

825
00:49:40,659 --> 00:49:43,428
LAURA: Right and then, one hyena set.

826
00:49:43,428 --> 00:49:46,981
KHARY: I appreciate you all counting ears, but can
we deal with the kid for a minute?

827
00:49:46,981 --> 00:49:48,984
SAM: He needs some help!

828
00:49:48,984 --> 00:49:50,465
LAURA: Do you see what I'm doing?

829
00:49:50,465 --> 00:49:53,978
SAM: Who are you?! Ah! Who are you?

830
00:49:53,978 --> 00:49:55,214
KHARY: I like your smile.

831
00:49:55,214 --> 00:49:56,992
(laughter)

832
00:49:56,992 --> 00:50:03,817
KHARY: Who am I? My name is Shakäste. Nice to meet
you.

833
00:50:03,817 --> 00:50:08,837
SAM: (swooning) He said Shakäste.

834
00:50:11,862 --> 00:50:15,541
KHARY: You can thank my bird for knowing what you
look like, actually.

835
00:50:15,541 --> 00:50:17,752
LAURA: Oh, I saw your bird!

836
00:50:17,752 --> 00:50:24,659
KHARY: That's not just some bird. That's the Grand
Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna. They call her Stacy,

837
00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:26,502
but that's not her name.

838
00:50:26,502 --> 00:50:27,886
LAURA: (whispering) The Grand Duchess.

839
00:50:27,886 --> 00:50:31,096
KHARY: The Grand Duchess. She's a sweetheart, but
she's angry.

840
00:50:31,096 --> 00:50:33,979
LIAM: It is very dark in here, what kind of bird
is that you have?

841
00:50:34,181 --> 00:50:42,092
KHARY: Oh, that would be an abrahum. That's a
dark, midnight hummingbird.

842
00:50:42,092 --> 00:50:46,413
MARISHA: Hey, you're a badass, what's your deal?

843
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:51,190
KHARY: Well, right now my deal it to deal with
this little person over here.

844
00:50:51,272 --> 00:50:56,059
LIAM: Yes, handle this child, but then we're very
curious to ask a couple-- I'll shut up.

845
00:50:56,059 --> 00:50:59,579
LAURA: Can you heal? Do you have healing? Because
I'm stabilizing him don't worry, but--

846
00:50:59,579 --> 00:51:01,676
SAM: He doesn't look good.

847
00:51:01,676 --> 00:51:03,568
KHARY: I think I can maybe do something about
that.

848
00:51:03,568 --> 00:51:07,135
MATT: Perhaps. The child is wounded, but the
child's wounds have been tended to. He's

849
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:13,570
unconscious, but is no longer in immediate danger
of dying. He'll eventually need rest.

850
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,150
LAURA: And some doughnuts.

851
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:16,730
MATT: Perhaps some doughnuts.

852
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:18,676
LAURA: I take one and push it onto his face.

853
00:51:18,676 --> 00:51:23,377
TRAVIS: No, no! Fresh doughnuts! You know do no harm,
all that shit?

854
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:26,323
SAM: Can you do anything to help this guy?

855
00:51:26,323 --> 00:51:28,947
KHARY: Well he seemed to be stabilized. I think
the best thing we could do is to get him to

856
00:51:28,947 --> 00:51:29,965
safety.

857
00:51:29,965 --> 00:51:35,507
TRAVIS: I agree. What were you doing down here? We
ourselves were comin' down trying to rescue folks.

858
00:51:35,871 --> 00:51:41,762
KHARY: I tend to look over the people who happen
to be around here. I come by every once in a

859
00:51:41,762 --> 00:51:49,979
while. I used to live and grew up in this place,
or in the valley not too far from here. Probably

860
00:51:49,979 --> 00:51:56,953
just like you, I heard a commotion. I've taken a
few of these people to safety. I've been trying to

861
00:51:56,953 --> 00:52:00,771
do it less overtly than some of you.

862
00:52:00,771 --> 00:52:02,984
TRAVIS: We do make a bit of a clatter.

863
00:52:02,984 --> 00:52:04,718
LAURA: We're working on it.

864
00:52:04,926 --> 00:52:06,606
SAM: Insight check!

865
00:52:06,606 --> 00:52:08,584
[laughter]

866
00:52:09,608 --> 00:52:14,535
11 plus, what am I adding? 13.

867
00:52:14,535 --> 00:52:24,982
MATT: 13. He's generally pretty forthright in
speech, charismatic figure, you don't get any

868
00:52:24,982 --> 00:52:34,593
sense of any immediate lying or conflict to the
words he's saying. You're also not getting a full

869
00:52:34,593 --> 00:52:36,455
read, either.

870
00:52:36,455 --> 00:52:38,760
SAM: How handsome is he?

871
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,445
MATT: Quite handsome. If you'd like to describe
how handsome you are.

872
00:52:41,445 --> 00:52:43,117
LIAM: Yeah, what do you look like?

873
00:52:43,186 --> 00:52:45,943
KHARY: I would say I'm an old--

874
00:52:45,943 --> 00:52:47,770
LAURA: On a scale from one to ten.

875
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:53,603
KHARY: On a scale from one to ten, I would call
him striking.

876
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:57,698
SAM: Bachelorette finalist?

877
00:52:57,726 --> 00:53:00,234
[laughter]

878
00:53:00,702 --> 00:53:06,774
KHARY: You know what? I think he's old enough that
he's gotten past all the bachelor-ing and the

879
00:53:06,774 --> 00:53:07,928
bachelorette-ing.

880
00:53:07,928 --> 00:53:09,830
LIAM: Are you a gray fox, is that what you are?

881
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:20,087
KHARY: I would call him more of a shock of white.
I mean, he's a striking character. He's got three

882
00:53:20,087 --> 00:53:29,595
dimples, one you can't see. Two are pretty deep in
his face and can be menacing, unless he's

883
00:53:29,595 --> 00:53:30,855
smiling.

884
00:53:30,855 --> 00:53:32,734
LAURA: What are you wearing?

885
00:53:32,734 --> 00:53:43,447
KHARY: He's covered in leather straps that are a
tangle of brown and red and green that pretty much

886
00:53:43,447 --> 00:53:52,814
cover him from his neck to his calf where his
boots start to take over. There's a hood that he's

887
00:53:52,814 --> 00:54:01,461
wearing, deep green. It goes down to his legs and
a big enough hood that's able to cover his ample

888
00:54:01,461 --> 00:54:03,100
locks.

889
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:10,593
LIAM: Meanwhile everyone is talking to this
stranger, I'm going to edge up to this hole in the

890
00:54:10,593 --> 00:54:16,998
ground and hold onto rocks because I'm scared to
death. Look over and send my globules of light

891
00:54:16,998 --> 00:54:21,145
down there to see if it's a deep hole, if it goes
a long way, what am I looking at?

892
00:54:21,145 --> 00:54:28,575
MATT: As your lights begin to slowly drift down
into the hole, they get about 50 or 60 feet down

893
00:54:28,575 --> 00:54:35,033
before you begin to see the bottom of the shaft. It
looks to have been an intentionally created

894
00:54:35,222 --> 00:54:42,168
well-like hole that has since seen disuse.
Currently ends into rocks and rubble.

895
00:54:42,168 --> 00:54:44,150
LAURA: It's a poop hole!

896
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:49,984
MATT: You see the broken body of a gnoll and the
broken body of a hyena down at the bottom of it.

897
00:54:49,984 --> 00:54:54,796
LIAM: We have to get this gnoll out of the bottom
of this hole because that's gold.

898
00:54:54,796 --> 00:55:00,496
LAURA: He's probably covered in really old poop.

899
00:55:00,496 --> 00:55:05,962
LIAM: It's still good for the monetary value that
was laid out for us, so maybe on the way out we

900
00:55:05,962 --> 00:55:11,785
could send-- We have a rope we could lower you
down and you could slice it off.

901
00:55:11,785 --> 00:55:13,348
SAM: Yeah, I could down there.

902
00:55:13,348 --> 00:55:14,803
LIAM: Not right now, save it for a rainy day.

903
00:55:14,803 --> 00:55:19,064
TRAVIS: Shakäste, my name is Fjord. We are, like I
said, on a rescue mission. Are you familiar with

904
00:55:19,064 --> 00:55:21,349
these tunnels, at all? Have you been down here
before?

905
00:55:21,909 --> 00:55:24,633
KHARY: Have I been down here before?

906
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:28,815
MATT: The most you've been down was the opposite
side of this tunnel here. There was a group up

907
00:55:28,815 --> 00:55:33,364
here where you had been working with previously,
but only recently decided to delve deeper once you

908
00:55:33,364 --> 00:55:36,213
had made sure that those few were safe.

909
00:55:36,213 --> 00:55:42,626
KHARY: Right, right. Well, I've done a pretty good
job of taking care of the other tentacle of this

910
00:55:42,626 --> 00:55:45,855
cavern, I guess you'd say.

911
00:55:45,855 --> 00:55:46,919
LAURA: Shaft.

912
00:55:46,919 --> 00:55:53,055
KHARY: Yes, the shaft. That's a good way of
putting it. That boom you may have heard happened

913
00:55:53,055 --> 00:55:58,593
to come from me, so we've got a little bit less to
have to deal with. This, I really don't know

914
00:55:58,593 --> 00:55:59,867
what's going on.

915
00:55:59,867 --> 00:56:06,680
LAURA: Oh, speaking of, I stand up and I 
walk to the door where the little kid was pulled from.

916
00:56:06,702 --> 00:56:13,529
LIAM: Wait, Nott, do you want to let her take a look
at it? In case it could blow up on you.

917
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:17,178
SAM: I've seen their traps. I know their methods!

918
00:56:17,178 --> 00:56:19,801
LAURA: Are there any ropes across the door?

919
00:56:19,801 --> 00:56:21,686
SAM: Let me look! Are there?

920
00:56:21,686 --> 00:56:23,433
MATT: Make an investigation check.

921
00:56:25,029 --> 00:56:29,006
SAM: Five. Plus five is ten.

922
00:56:29,006 --> 00:56:34,372
MATT: Best you can tell, it doesn't appear to be
trapped. It does have a simple latch that is only

923
00:56:34,372 --> 00:56:37,330
accessible from the outer side, but it is not
locked.

924
00:56:37,330 --> 00:56:43,758
LAURA: I knock on the door. Housekeeping! Is
anybody locked in here?

925
00:56:43,758 --> 00:56:48,273
MATT: A moment passes. There's no response, but
you hear the faint sniffing and whimpering of

926
00:56:48,273 --> 00:56:50,051
somebody on the other side.

927
00:56:50,069 --> 00:56:51,562
LAURA: I think it's the mom.

928
00:56:51,562 --> 00:56:52,670
SAM: Let's open the door.

929
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:54,674
LAURA: Okay. (turning noise)

930
00:56:54,674 --> 00:57:02,629
MATT: You lift the small latch and pull the door
open. First it hits you, a strong smell of decay.

931
00:57:02,629 --> 00:57:09,230
You see the back of this room is filled with piles
of bodies or parts of bodies. It looks to be maybe

932
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:15,534
four people in total that have been placed here.
Then there's one living woman, in her mid-thirties

933
00:57:15,534 --> 00:57:23,350
or so, who is wearing a dirtied apron. She's
covered in dirt. A spatter of blood, you don't

934
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:28,903
know if it's from her or not. Her hair is ratted.
She looks to be human. She's currently huddled

935
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:33,692
with her knees to her chest and there's tear
streaks down her face.

936
00:57:33,692 --> 00:57:36,044
SAM: Is the, is the-- Oh, sorry, go on.

937
00:57:36,044 --> 00:57:40,451
KHARY: Can I walk to her?

938
00:57:40,451 --> 00:57:46,527
MATT: Yeah. As you open the door you watch as
Shakäste begins to approach and take the space.

939
00:57:46,527 --> 00:57:54,974
KHARY: I look her in the eye. I put my hand on her
chin, so that she looks me in the eye, and I tell

940
00:57:54,974 --> 00:58:01,502
her, shh. What does that make her feel?

941
00:58:01,502 --> 00:58:07,554
MATT: You watch as there's a brief moment of
confusion, and then an expression of

942
00:58:07,554 --> 00:58:14,094
acknowledgement comes across her face. She reaches
up and takes your hand. She goes, "Thank you.

943
00:58:14,094 --> 00:58:15,698
Thank you."

944
00:58:15,698 --> 00:58:17,664
KHARY: We need to get her out of here.

945
00:58:17,664 --> 00:58:18,958
LAURA: Yes. Definitely.

946
00:58:18,958 --> 00:58:20,162
MARISHA: Holy shit, this guy's good.

947
00:58:20,162 --> 00:58:21,787
TRAVIS: He is. Smooth operator.

948
00:58:21,787 --> 00:58:25,577
SAM: Can I ask the woman, is this your child?

949
00:58:25,577 --> 00:58:30,693
MATT: She turns around, and she goes, "Oh my god!"
She runs over to him and immediately picks him up

950
00:58:30,693 --> 00:58:33,011
into her arms and begins to hold him.

951
00:58:33,011 --> 00:58:34,833
LAURA: He's alive, don't worry.

952
00:58:34,833 --> 00:58:43,386
MATT: (crying) "Thank you. Thank you." She's
rocking the child in her arms, quietly rubbing his

953
00:58:43,386 --> 00:58:46,739
face and wiping a bit of blood off of his cheeks.

954
00:58:46,739 --> 00:58:50,297
LAURA: Are there any other people that are alive
that you know of?

955
00:58:50,297 --> 00:58:58,405
MATT: "There are a few. I haven't seen, but I've
heard voices across the way, and they took a

956
00:58:58,405 --> 00:59:01,985
number deeper in, before they locked me in."

957
00:59:01,985 --> 00:59:04,379
LAURA: Oh. Can we run over to the other door?

958
00:59:04,379 --> 00:59:09,168
TALIESIN: I was saying, if I'm not near the other
door I'm going to start looking and unlatching it.

959
00:59:09,168 --> 00:59:10,556
Nonchalantly.

960
00:59:10,556 --> 00:59:16,021
MATT: You unlatch it. You watch as the mother,
who's currently running her fingers over the hair

961
00:59:16,021 --> 00:59:22,438
of the boy, says, "Jules, it's okay. It's okay,
Jules." She pulls him in. The other door, as you

962
00:59:22,438 --> 00:59:28,858
open it, a familiar sight. It looks like there's
three bodies in here. These bodies seem to be

963
00:59:28,858 --> 00:59:37,225
placed in here for some sort of storage, for the
time being. There is one figure you can see, a man

964
00:59:37,225 --> 00:59:43,499
in his older years. Half-elven in appearance, his
features are a little sharper, a little more

965
00:59:43,499 --> 00:59:52,297
elven, but not fully. His hair is dark-brown,
black to gray, and salt and pepper on the sides.

966
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:55,824
He looks as disheveled as the woman you just
uncovered.

967
00:59:55,869 --> 00:59:56,955
LAURA: But he's alive?

968
00:59:56,955 --> 00:59:57,909
MATT: He's alive.

969
00:59:57,909 --> 01:00:00,702
TALIESIN: This is a personal question. Is there
anyone alive in here right now?

970
01:00:00,702 --> 01:00:02,344
MATT: "I'm the only one."

971
01:00:02,344 --> 01:00:06,740
TALIESIN: Oh! Well, we'll take it. I'm swinging
the door open and coming in.

972
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:13,112
MATT: You get up, and you can see now, there's a
large claw gash across his midsection that might

973
01:00:13,112 --> 01:00:15,013
be infected.

974
01:00:15,013 --> 01:00:18,534
TALIESIN: If you wait a second, it's only getting
better.

975
01:00:18,534 --> 01:00:21,798
MATT: "Who are you?"

976
01:00:21,798 --> 01:00:26,566
TALIESIN: Oh, that is a question. We're here to
help. Come on out.

977
01:00:26,566 --> 01:00:28,147
LAURA: We're the rescue party.

978
01:00:28,147 --> 01:00:35,917
MARISHA: Is there anyone else that you were with
that's no longer with us in there?

979
01:00:35,917 --> 01:00:43,642
MATT: "I mean--" He points back and says, "I don't
know most of these folks, I was just passing

980
01:00:43,825 --> 01:00:52,552
through. We were bringing some of our armor-wares
up to Zadash when we were waylaid on the road.

981
01:00:52,552 --> 01:00:56,128
MARISHA: You didn't get taken from Alfield?

982
01:00:56,128 --> 01:01:00,102
MATT: "Oh, we were taken on the way to Alfield. We
were almost there. They hit us right as they were

983
01:01:00,126 --> 01:01:02,748
reaching the city. We had no chance."

984
01:01:02,748 --> 01:01:05,191
TALIESIN: You got hit on the way to the city, not
in the raid on the city?

985
01:01:05,191 --> 01:01:07,821
MATT: "We were just arriving in Alfield when it
hit."

986
01:01:07,821 --> 01:01:09,283
LAURA: Bad timing.

987
01:01:09,283 --> 01:01:10,952
MATT: "You're telling me."

988
01:01:10,952 --> 01:01:15,165
TALIESIN: Let's get you out here, for a second.

989
01:01:15,165 --> 01:01:17,779
MATT: The woman has come up once again to--

990
01:01:17,779 --> 01:01:23,813
KHARY: I have a place for these people to go. It's
up on the surface.

991
01:01:23,813 --> 01:01:25,065
LAURA: They're safe there?

992
01:01:25,065 --> 01:01:26,847
KHARY: They will be safe there.

993
01:01:26,847 --> 01:01:29,256
LAURA: Do you have a cart to get them back to
Alfield?

994
01:01:29,256 --> 01:01:36,957
KHARY: Well, a cart was just the thing I was
needing. What say we hang out?

995
01:01:36,957 --> 01:01:40,462
LAURA: All of us together, like a big party?

996
01:01:40,462 --> 01:01:41,714
KHARY: I've got nothing else to do.

997
01:01:41,714 --> 01:01:43,052
LAURA: I like it.

998
01:01:43,052 --> 01:01:44,514
TALIESIN: So many new friends lately.

999
01:01:44,514 --> 01:01:49,091
TRAVIS: I am concerned that there are more further
on in these tunnels, but I think you're right, we

1000
01:01:49,091 --> 01:01:51,821
won't be of any use to these people if we don't
get them to safety first.

1001
01:01:51,821 --> 01:01:53,062
KHARY: Exactly.

1002
01:01:53,062 --> 01:01:59,607
MARISHA: How far was that tunnel to the surface?
We cleared out this side.

1003
01:01:59,607 --> 01:02:02,264
KHARY: Have we lost our way from- or at least the
way that I--

1004
01:02:02,264 --> 01:02:04,248
MATT: That tunnel's not operational.

1005
01:02:04,248 --> 01:02:09,080
KHARY: That tunnel's not operational. We've got
two ways out here, I see.

1006
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:12,751
MATT: You have this way, which appears to go
deeper into the mine.

1007
01:02:12,751 --> 01:02:14,717
TRAVIS: Yeah, not that way, nope.

1008
01:02:14,717 --> 01:02:16,479
MATT: This way, which backtracks where you guys
come from.

1009
01:02:16,479 --> 01:02:17,558
TRAVIS: That's the one.

1010
01:02:17,558 --> 01:02:21,413
TALIESIN: Do we need to escort them or can we send
them up to the surface?

1011
01:02:21,413 --> 01:02:26,129
LIAM: You know what we could do? If we want to
check this cave for more people, is that we could

1012
01:02:26,129 --> 01:02:33,028
bring them up to the cart and I could do that one
spell that I have that would let me know down here

1013
01:02:33,028 --> 01:02:35,146
if anything is happening up there--

1014
01:02:35,146 --> 01:02:35,908
LAURA: Yeah.

1015
01:02:35,908 --> 01:02:39,945
LIAM: Yeah. If the little bell goes off in my head
then I know that either that something's coming out--

1016
01:02:39,945 --> 01:02:41,408
LAURA: The good bell, not the bad bell.

1017
01:02:41,408 --> 01:02:47,278
LIAM: The good kind, <i>ja</i>. We would know, more or less,
not 100 percent perfect, but pretty close. Then we

1018
01:02:47,498 --> 01:02:51,012
could come back down here quickly, and see if
there's anyone else who needs help.

1019
01:02:51,012 --> 01:02:55,485
MARISHA: How long is it going to take to hike back
the way we came?

1020
01:02:55,485 --> 01:02:58,498
MATT: Not too long, maybe 20 or so minutes back to
the surface.

1021
01:02:58,498 --> 01:02:59,655
MARISHA: Let's do it.

1022
01:02:59,655 --> 01:03:00,935
KHARY: That's not bad.

1023
01:03:00,935 --> 01:03:03,083
SAM: Are we going to leave some folks down here
to--

1024
01:03:03,083 --> 01:03:04,616
LAURA: No.

1025
01:03:04,616 --> 01:03:07,920
SAM: What if they repopulate all of these rooms
that we've already cleared?

1026
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:10,402
TRAVIS: We should move together. There's no point
in leaving just a few--

1027
01:03:10,402 --> 01:03:13,679
TALIESIN: If you leave your alarm up here--

1028
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:19,710
LIAM: Well, I was thinking about getting them to
safety outside. If anything leaves the mine, we'll

1029
01:03:19,710 --> 01:03:21,670
know it was them.

1030
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:23,466
TALIESIN: That's fair then, yeah. That's a good
plan.

1031
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:24,729
LAURA: Let's do it.

1032
01:03:24,729 --> 01:03:28,756
SAM: I don't like this plan at all. What if
someone-- What if one of the gnolls wanders into

1033
01:03:28,756 --> 01:03:31,343
this room and sees five of his dead brothers?

1034
01:03:31,343 --> 01:03:33,418
LAURA: Let's throw them down the hole!

1035
01:03:33,418 --> 01:03:36,537
TALIESIN: We start kicking them right up to the
edge, kicking them right in the hole.

1036
01:03:36,537 --> 01:03:39,290
MATT: One after another, you take the remainders
of the previous battle and roll them into the hole

1037
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:41,137
in the center.

1038
01:03:41,137 --> 01:03:43,020
KHARY: Good call.

1039
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:45,331
LAURA: Now they all look like they just left and
had some--

1040
01:03:45,331 --> 01:03:49,501
SAM: There's a whole other room with dead bodies
in it that we also caused, and also ball bearings.

1041
01:03:49,756 --> 01:03:51,838
TALIESIN: Oh, people die all the time.

1042
01:03:51,838 --> 01:03:54,468
LAURA: You know, sometimes accidents happen.

1043
01:03:54,468 --> 01:03:57,717
TRAVIS: We'll be coming right back down. We just
need to get them to safety.

1044
01:03:57,717 --> 01:04:01,141
LIAM: You know, people don't bare balls all the
time, but I think it's a reasonable risk at this

1045
01:04:01,141 --> 01:04:03,027
point in time.

1046
01:04:03,027 --> 01:04:06,152
TRAVIS: Plus, we could take a short rest up top
while we're getting them folks to safety.

1047
01:04:06,152 --> 01:04:07,650
SAM: All right.

1048
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:09,236
TALIESIN: I like this plan.

1049
01:04:09,236 --> 01:04:12,210
SAM: Are there any other boxes or things to search
down here before we get out?

1050
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:13,635
MATT: You can search if you want to.

1051
01:04:13,635 --> 01:04:15,339
LAURA: Yeah, let's search around.

1052
01:04:15,339 --> 01:04:18,626
MARISHA: Oh my God. I crack boxes like fucking
Zelda.

1053
01:04:18,626 --> 01:04:20,678
TRAVIS: Quietly, maybe?

1054
01:04:20,678 --> 01:04:22,067
MARISHA: Quiet, sorry.

1055
01:04:22,067 --> 01:04:27,001
LAURA: How many dead bodies do you think I could
carry?

1056
01:04:27,001 --> 01:04:29,235
MATT: You could drag two.

1057
01:04:29,235 --> 01:04:30,956
TALIESIN: I'll take a couple as well.

1058
01:04:30,956 --> 01:04:33,233
MATT: Because you're pretty strong, you could drag
two bodies.

1059
01:04:33,233 --> 01:04:35,155
LAURA: I'm going to try to drag some of the dead
out--

1060
01:04:35,155 --> 01:04:37,879
MATT: Everybody else can take one each, I think,
based on your strengths. You can take none.

1061
01:04:37,879 --> 01:04:40,736
KHARY: Yeah, my dragging days are over.

1062
01:04:40,736 --> 01:04:44,744
TALIESIN: We're going to look around, see if
there's anything of interest.

1063
01:04:44,744 --> 01:04:47,195
MATT: All right, so two of you can make
investigation checks on this one.

1064
01:04:47,195 --> 01:04:49,744
LIAM: I will help you look because I have an
eye--

1065
01:04:49,744 --> 01:04:52,433
LAURA: You need glasses though.

1066
01:04:52,433 --> 01:04:56,139
LIAM: No, I have very-- trust me, I mean I could
roll for shit but--

1067
01:04:56,139 --> 01:04:57,509
MARISHA: He's nearsighted.

1068
01:04:57,509 --> 01:04:59,088
LAURA: Oh nearsighted, I understand.

1069
01:04:59,088 --> 01:05:00,871
LIAM: That's okay.

1070
01:05:00,871 --> 01:05:02,031
MARISHA: But you have advantage.

1071
01:05:02,031 --> 01:05:03,442
LIAM: Do I have advantage?

1072
01:05:03,442 --> 01:05:04,939
MARISHA: Because he's assisting you.

1073
01:05:04,939 --> 01:05:06,337
MATT: If he's assisting you, yeah.

1074
01:05:06,337 --> 01:05:13,545
LIAM: That's a little better. Oh, yeah, it's good.
That's 15. You know, for level three. <i>Fünfzehn</i>.

1075
01:05:13,545 --> 01:05:16,284
TRAVIS: (chanting) Level three. Level three.

1076
01:05:16,284 --> 01:05:26,588
MATT: In a quick glance through, a lot of it
appears to be pickaxes, shovels. Most in here

1077
01:05:26,588 --> 01:05:33,281
seems to be tools and anything of worth has been
ravaged or taken. You find a few bits of rotted

1078
01:05:33,281 --> 01:05:37,859
meat of indeterminate origin, that you immediately
shrink away from.

1079
01:05:37,859 --> 01:05:41,938
LIAM: No, actually, I'm going to scoop up some of
those pieces of rotted meat and put them in my

1080
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:42,921
pockets.

1081
01:05:42,921 --> 01:05:44,343
MATT: Okay. There you go.

1082
01:05:44,343 --> 01:05:45,681
LIAM: You can't smell it.

1083
01:05:45,681 --> 01:05:47,187
SAM: No, it smells good to me!

1084
01:05:47,187 --> 01:05:48,524
TRAVIS: Could be good bait later.

1085
01:05:48,524 --> 01:05:50,139
LIAM: That's why I'm taking it.

1086
01:05:50,139 --> 01:05:54,160
SAM: Any baubles or little doodads?

1087
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:59,999
MATT: Nothing in this chamber, unfortunately. This
one has either been picked clean or didn't contain

1088
01:05:59,999 --> 01:06:02,367
anything of immediate worth in the process.

1089
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:04,964
SAM: Oh, I don't care about worth.

1090
01:06:05,764 --> 01:06:08,451
MATT: I mean, there are plenty of bodies you could
rummage through if you wanted to, but.

1091
01:06:08,451 --> 01:06:12,292
LAURA: As we're walking them, Nott's going through
the pockets.

1092
01:06:12,292 --> 01:06:14,141
KHARY: Anything explosive?

1093
01:06:14,141 --> 01:06:16,099
MATT: You can make an investigation check, if
you'd like.

1094
01:06:16,099 --> 01:06:17,525
KHARY: All right. How would I do that?

1095
01:06:17,525 --> 01:06:20,279
MATT: Roll a d20 and add your investigation skill
bonus.

1096
01:06:20,279 --> 01:06:23,198
LIAM: It's there by-- good
roll.

1097
01:06:23,528 --> 01:06:24,884
KHARY: Plus one.

1098
01:06:25,070 --> 01:06:26,413
LIAM: Yeah, 15 for him.

1099
01:06:26,413 --> 01:06:31,916
MATT: 15 as well. All right, so. Not in this
chamber in particular, but as you guys are going

1100
01:06:31,916 --> 01:06:37,850
through the other tunnel, you glance over in one
of the overturned boxes and you find another

1101
01:06:37,850 --> 01:06:43,317
familiar object, one of which you had used
previously. Another singular stick with a long

1102
01:06:43,317 --> 01:06:48,891
explosive wick on the end. You have another piece
with you.

1103
01:06:48,891 --> 01:06:51,323
KHARY: Gingerly, I take it up.

1104
01:06:51,323 --> 01:06:55,336
SAM: Gently! You should be careful with that.
Those can make big booms.

1105
01:06:55,336 --> 01:06:58,956
KHARY: This ain't my first rodeo, baby. Thank
you.

1106
01:06:58,956 --> 01:07:01,202
SAM: (flustered noise)

1107
01:07:01,816 --> 01:07:07,577
MATT: As he says that and turns, you watch as the
small black hummingbird perches on his shoulder as

1108
01:07:07,577 --> 01:07:09,676
he continues to walk.

1109
01:07:09,676 --> 01:07:11,722
SAM: He's got a Frumpkin too!

1110
01:07:11,722 --> 01:07:16,519
LAURA: I'm dragging the bodies going, Duchess!
Duchess Stacy, please come over to me! Duchess

1111
01:07:16,519 --> 01:07:18,120
Stacy!

1112
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:19,750
KHARY: Grand Duchess.

1113
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:21,754
LAURA: Grand Duchess Stacy!

1114
01:07:21,754 --> 01:07:24,427
TRAVIS: We make our way back up to the top.

1115
01:07:24,427 --> 01:07:29,200
MATT: I'll have you all-- You can't make stealth
checks. You're dragging bodies. Who's carrying;

1116
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,756
how many bodies are you bringing back?

1117
01:07:30,756 --> 01:07:32,090
TALIESIN, TRAVIS, LIAM, MARISHA, and MATT: One.

1118
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:33,470
LAURA: Two.

1119
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:35,203
MATT: That's four, five, six, seven.

1120
01:07:35,203 --> 01:07:37,674
SAM: I will go ahead of the party to run point.

1121
01:07:37,674 --> 01:07:39,446
MATT: Make a perception check for me.

1122
01:07:40,915 --> 01:07:42,133
SAM: 11.

1123
01:07:42,133 --> 01:07:46,663
MATT: Okay. You guys carefully make your way back
up through, trying not to drag the bodies over

1124
01:07:46,663 --> 01:07:52,303
heavy bumps or rocks, eventually making your way
out of the main entrance way. You notice a trap

1125
01:07:52,303 --> 01:07:59,111
that you had deftly avoided multiple times getting
people in and out, of a large tree trunk that had

1126
01:07:59,111 --> 01:08:03,614
been suspended in the roof to swing down when
triggered, had been triggered and is now hanging

1127
01:08:03,614 --> 01:08:08,531
there. Apparently somebody made an unfortunate
mistake making their way through. You all

1128
01:08:08,531 --> 01:08:13,093
eventually find your way out into the daylight
once more. The woman, who's now introduced herself

1129
01:08:13,093 --> 01:08:19,460
as Herma, and the older half-elf man, Petrov, all
step out into the light, blinking, bleary in the

1130
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:26,102
sudden influx of light. As soon as you make it
into the open sky, you can see this breath of

1131
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:32,209
relief wash over both of them, and the young boy
is now starting to come to consciousness again.

1132
01:08:32,209 --> 01:08:40,747
Goes, "Mom?" She goes, "Shh! It's okay; it's
okay." She looks up over towards Shakäste, and has

1133
01:08:40,747 --> 01:08:44,339
more tears in her eyes, and goes, "Thank you."

1134
01:08:46,249 --> 01:08:47,732
SAM: I helped too!

1135
01:08:47,756 --> 01:08:51,566
LAURA: I stabilized him. I stabilized him real
good.

1136
01:08:51,566 --> 01:08:58,272
MATT: "Thank you all so much." You lead them over
through the hills here, that cluster around where

1137
01:08:58,272 --> 01:09:03,495
this mine once was, around the corner there
appears to be a shed that's been long abandoned

1138
01:09:03,495 --> 01:09:11,674
and locked up. As you approach, you have been here
previously.

1139
01:09:13,754 --> 01:09:18,020
KHARY: I take my reed stick and rap on the door.

1140
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:23,037
MATT: "Is that you?"

1141
01:09:23,037 --> 01:09:24,778
KHARY: Shh.

1142
01:09:24,778 --> 01:09:32,030
MATT: The door opens and there you can see
emerging four survivors, also from Alfield that,

1143
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:37,509
with bright eyes, welcome the arrival of this
strange traveler, as well as the three other

1144
01:09:37,509 --> 01:09:44,416
survivors you've brought in. As some of them begin
to reunite with people that are familiar to them,

1145
01:09:44,416 --> 01:09:50,394
people who live in Alfield and know each other,
they begin to hold each other and take a moment to

1146
01:09:50,394 --> 01:09:57,691
relish in this renewed moment of life. Then they
begin to pour over the bodies that have been

1147
01:09:57,691 --> 01:10:03,271
recovered, and they begin to identify them to each
other, and then sadness takes over. Then once

1148
01:10:03,271 --> 01:10:09,815
those waves have passed, individuals begin to go
up and thank you, and take your hand, and a few of

1149
01:10:09,815 --> 01:10:16,134
them are like, "Anything I can give you, please,
just let me know. Thank you so much." It's a lot,

1150
01:10:16,134 --> 01:10:23,845
to have at once, and for many of you an experience
that is different and new. Take it as you will,

1151
01:10:23,845 --> 01:10:28,596
however you wish to, but you also know time is of
the essence, and not too much time can be spent on

1152
01:10:28,596 --> 01:10:29,528
this.

1153
01:10:29,541 --> 01:10:34,054
LIAM: I would say that I did not partake in any of
that. As soon as we exited efficiently, I pulled

1154
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:38,690
out the silver thread and I'm already doing my
thing while they do that.

1155
01:10:38,690 --> 01:10:48,309
KHARY: I would say, to the people inside: Stay
safe, stay here. I look at everyone else and say:

1156
01:10:48,309 --> 01:10:50,220
this isn't over.

1157
01:10:50,220 --> 01:10:52,399
MARISHA and KHARY: Let's go.

1158
01:10:52,399 --> 01:10:54,702
LIAM and MARISHA: Let's go.

1159
01:10:54,702 --> 01:10:57,383
TRAVIS: That's a badass motherfucker, I'm just
saying.

1160
01:10:57,383 --> 01:11:01,127
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm so about it. He's so cool.

1161
01:11:01,127 --> 01:11:02,949
TRAVIS: I know. Number one fan club.

1162
01:11:02,949 --> 01:11:05,002
LIAM: I guess we do not need a perception check.

1163
01:11:05,002 --> 01:11:11,387
MATT: All the bodies are placed in a small pile
and a large heavy piece of canvas material is

1164
01:11:11,387 --> 01:11:15,923
placed over them to hide them. The shed is closed
and locked, and they all seem to feel, at least

1165
01:11:15,923 --> 01:11:20,052
for the moment, comfort and safety in this space,
as you all begin to delve once more into the mines

1166
01:11:20,052 --> 01:11:27,352
beneath the hills. I would like you all to make a
stealth check, please, as you progress further in.

1167
01:11:27,407 --> 01:11:29,102
LIAM: Oh good. That's my specialty.

1168
01:11:29,102 --> 01:11:33,180
LAURA: Ooh, I could give someone a blessing, who's
shitty at this? Blessing!

1169
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:35,877
LIAM: Thank you. Ugh.

1170
01:11:35,877 --> 01:11:37,255
TRAVIS: Ugh.

1171
01:11:37,255 --> 01:11:38,711
KHARY: What am I doing?

1172
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:40,184
TRAVIS: 15.

1173
01:11:40,184 --> 01:11:41,772
SAM and LAURA: Roll a 20.

1174
01:11:41,772 --> 01:11:43,110
KHARY: Roll the 20.

1175
01:11:43,110 --> 01:11:44,227
MARISHA: 25.

1176
01:11:44,227 --> 01:11:45,572
LIAM: Eight.

1177
01:11:45,572 --> 01:11:46,703
LAURA: With advantage?!

1178
01:11:46,703 --> 01:11:47,427
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

1179
01:11:47,427 --> 01:11:48,698
LAURA: Fuck.

1180
01:11:48,698 --> 01:11:49,852
LIAM: You brought me from a four to a seven.

1181
01:11:49,852 --> 01:11:51,205
LAURA: Oh, Jesus.

1182
01:11:51,205 --> 01:11:52,341
KHARY: 17.

1183
01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:53,503
SAM: 13.

1184
01:11:53,503 --> 01:11:55,211
LAURA and TALIESIN: 18.

1185
01:11:55,211 --> 01:12:02,865
MATT: Universally, you guys are all confident in
your ability to delve without being seen, even

1186
01:12:02,865 --> 01:12:06,718
making up for those who maybe not have been a less
bumbling experience making their way in.

1187
01:12:06,718 --> 01:12:08,260
LIAM: I stubbed my toe!

1188
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:09,590
MARISHA: Shh!

1189
01:12:09,590 --> 01:12:12,383
(laughter)

1190
01:12:12,383 --> 01:12:15,269
TALIESIN: Learn how to see in the bloody dark!

1191
01:12:15,269 --> 01:12:17,817
KHARY: You've got light, boy, you'll be fine.

1192
01:12:17,817 --> 01:12:22,726
MATT: You make your way back through the familiar
tunnel, and you can now see that the right tunnel,

1193
01:12:22,726 --> 01:12:29,421
the one that you had previously seen the pitfall
and decided to not head down into, is now a large

1194
01:12:29,421 --> 01:12:31,325
cluster of rock and rubble.

1195
01:12:31,325 --> 01:12:32,555
LAURA: Oh, that's where you came from?

1196
01:12:32,555 --> 01:12:33,722
KHARY: Mm.

1197
01:12:33,722 --> 01:12:43,315
MATT: You progress down through the ritual area,
carefully avoiding a scattering of metallic ball

1198
01:12:43,315 --> 01:12:50,299
bearings across the floor. You see an altar with
candles on it that have all burned down entirely,

1199
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:55,911
except for a few tiny flickers. Is there any light
source you guys are bringing down here with you?

1200
01:12:55,911 --> 01:12:57,465
LIAM: (spell effect)

1201
01:12:57,465 --> 01:13:02,103
MATT: All right, the balls of light now float as
you progress, giving everyone who needs it sight.

1202
01:13:02,103 --> 01:13:07,103
You head down into the familiar chamber where this
last fray occurred, carefully avoiding the large

1203
01:13:07,103 --> 01:13:15,432
hole in the ground. This is the only other exit
from this chamber. You continue forward. Who's

1204
01:13:15,432 --> 01:13:17,606
taking point, and what is the marching order,
please?

1205
01:13:17,606 --> 01:13:19,120
LAURA: Keep checking for traps, okay?

1206
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:21,109
SAM: All right, that's a good idea.

1207
01:13:21,109 --> 01:13:23,353
KHARY: Can I send the Grand Duchess?

1208
01:13:23,353 --> 01:13:25,012
MATT: You may.

1209
01:13:25,012 --> 01:13:26,899
TALIESIN: I'm not getting over that.

1210
01:13:26,899 --> 01:13:29,419
LAURA: Oh, the Grand Duchess and Frumpkin will be
best of friends.

1211
01:13:29,422 --> 01:13:31,352
MARISHA: Do they like each other?

1212
01:13:31,352 --> 01:13:32,815
LIAM: Frumpkin was obliterated.

1213
01:13:32,815 --> 01:13:35,693
KHARY: --stay away from my bird.

1214
01:13:35,693 --> 01:13:40,249
LIAM: You know, it's funny, because only about 30
minutes ago I also had a bird, but he was

1215
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:41,468
obliterated.

1216
01:13:41,468 --> 01:13:42,402
MARISHA: Oh, that's right.

1217
01:13:42,402 --> 01:13:45,512
LIAM: It was very sad. I'll bring him back
tomorrow.

1218
01:13:45,512 --> 01:13:47,481
KHARY: Thanks for that.

1219
01:13:47,481 --> 01:13:56,459
(laughter)

1220
01:13:56,459 --> 01:13:58,556
LIAM: He and I, we are like that.

1221
01:13:59,496 --> 01:14:02,554
TRAVIS: It's going on, it's going.

1222
01:14:02,554 --> 01:14:04,702
SAM: He's very charming.

1223
01:14:04,702 --> 01:14:09,247
LAURA: I feel like we're seeing more of Caleb's
social awkwardness, seeing him from the outside,

1224
01:14:09,247 --> 01:14:10,430
it's so good.

1225
01:14:10,430 --> 01:14:12,529
TALIESIN: It's everything I could've wanted.

1226
01:14:12,529 --> 01:14:16,944
MATT: As you take a moment to continue focusing,
as you do, through the vision of your bird,

1227
01:14:16,944 --> 01:14:21,319
(hovering hum) coasts down through the tunnel
before you to keep an eye out.

1228
01:14:21,319 --> 01:14:26,447
Make a perception check for your bird, please.
Roll a d20, and add two to it.

1229
01:14:26,447 --> 01:14:27,195
KHARY: 17.

1230
01:14:27,195 --> 01:14:30,670
MATT: 17, nice. The bird's perception, not his.

1231
01:14:30,670 --> 01:14:38,019
MATT: That's great. The tunnel descends at a
moderate grade for about 80 to 100 feet before it

1232
01:14:38,019 --> 01:14:45,749
levels off once more. Ahead, you see a set of
rough stairs that rise for about five or six feet,

1233
01:14:45,749 --> 01:14:49,885
leading to the remainder of the tunnel, and then
curving to the left suddenly out of sight,

1234
01:14:49,885 --> 01:14:58,254
slightly along this elevation. Right there, you
have your bird (hovering hum), and right as the

1235
01:14:58,254 --> 01:15:03,666
stairs ascend and turn immediately, there is the
outer corner of a gnoll stands there

1236
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:13,210
waiting, keeping watch. (gnoll murmurs) Do you
want to send your bird in further to check out the

1237
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:16,549
rest of the room or pull it back?

1238
01:15:16,549 --> 01:15:18,507
KHARY: She's quick.

1239
01:15:18,507 --> 01:15:19,546
MATT: She's pretty quick.

1240
01:15:19,546 --> 01:15:20,540
KHARY: I say move on.

1241
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:25,937
MATT: All right. (hovering hum) Okay.

1242
01:15:25,937 --> 01:15:29,927
LAURA: It's really smart that he made a 
hummingbird. That's really fast.

1243
01:15:29,927 --> 01:15:31,519
TALIESIN: It's really clever.

1244
01:15:31,519 --> 01:15:34,754
LAURA: It's a pretty smart move, don't you think?

1245
01:15:34,754 --> 01:15:36,244
LIAM: It's not a cat.

1246
01:15:36,244 --> 01:15:38,163
SAM: One that can see in the dark.

1247
01:15:38,163 --> 01:15:40,480
LAURA: Yeah. I mean, it's really smart.

1248
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:48,719
MATT: As the Duchess moves further and up to the
platform, the Duchess can see another portion of

1249
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:53,311
the floor that is collapsed inward into another
falling pit that rests against the wall on the

1250
01:15:53,311 --> 01:15:58,581
opposite side of where these stairs ascend. The
tunnel curves to the left immediately, where this

1251
01:15:58,581 --> 01:16:03,060
hole is on the top, and where it continues down
there appears to be a large archway where there

1252
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:07,625
was once a set of double doors. The doors have
been broken off the hinges and are not visible at

1253
01:16:07,625 --> 01:16:13,703
current sight, but to each side of the frame, you
can see two skeletal gnolls with bits of flesh and

1254
01:16:13,703 --> 01:16:19,426
skin hanging off their bones and rib cage and
snout, sitting there like silent undead sentinels

1255
01:16:19,426 --> 01:16:23,783
looking around.

1256
01:16:23,783 --> 01:16:27,419
KHARY: Thank you so much. Come back to me, dear.

1257
01:16:27,419 --> 01:16:33,527
MATT: (hovering hum) Charging back to the tunnel,
back to your shoulder.

1258
01:16:33,527 --> 01:16:42,231
KHARY: We have a friend about a hundred feet away.
He's by himself, but yeah, there's just the one.

1259
01:16:42,231 --> 01:16:48,361
Beyond him, there is more to deal with. I think we
quietly take care of this gentleman first, and

1260
01:16:48,361 --> 01:16:52,361
then we move on.

1261
01:16:52,361 --> 01:16:53,847
LAURA: Did you see any survivors?

1262
01:16:53,847 --> 01:17:00,106
KHARY: Not yet, but there are two sentinels and
they are guarding something. I'm hoping that's

1263
01:17:00,106 --> 01:17:01,068
someone.

1264
01:17:01,068 --> 01:17:06,468
TRAVIS: Perhaps we can create a little bit of a
lure to bring back that single fellow closer to us

1265
01:17:06,468 --> 01:17:08,128
and we dispatch him quietly.

1266
01:17:08,128 --> 01:17:09,378
KHARY: It's not a bad idea.

1267
01:17:09,378 --> 01:17:14,610
MARISHA: I reached into the ball bearings that I
have left since I have about half. I take one and

1268
01:17:14,610 --> 01:17:16,550
go-- (ball bearing bouncing)

1269
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:25,235
MATT: Down along to the grade? (ball bearing
bouncing) Eventually, you can no longer hear any

1270
01:17:25,235 --> 01:17:29,468
noise the ball bearing makes as it continues out
of your earshot.

1271
01:17:29,468 --> 01:17:34,782
LIAM: I'm also going with the Dancing Lights.
They're not leading the way. The closest one is

1272
01:17:34,782 --> 01:17:42,331
actually ten feet behind us like a choo-choo train
back behind the group so that it's dim light 20 to

1273
01:17:42,331 --> 01:17:43,354
30 feet ahead of us.

1274
01:17:43,354 --> 01:17:53,793
MATT: Okay. A minute passes. Two minutes.
You don't see any indication that anything noticed

1275
01:17:53,793 --> 01:17:54,925
or heard.

1276
01:17:54,925 --> 01:17:58,458
MARISHA: Ah, shit! He's stupid!

1277
01:17:58,458 --> 01:18:00,704
LAURA: Maybe he's sleeping.

1278
01:18:00,704 --> 01:18:03,280
TRAVIS: Who's real good at dispatching them quiet?

1279
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,759
MARISHA: Nott, do you want to?

1280
01:18:04,759 --> 01:18:06,613
SAM: Don't make me do this again.

1281
01:18:06,613 --> 01:18:10,487
TRAVIS: I tell you what, if you summon some
courage, I'll come with you.

1282
01:18:10,487 --> 01:18:11,823
SAM: All right.

1283
01:18:11,823 --> 01:18:16,447
KHARY: Could I give her some guidance?

1284
01:18:16,447 --> 01:18:19,668
MATT: You may if you are going to try to stealth
it.

1285
01:18:19,668 --> 01:18:22,484
SAM: Sure, what does that mean?

1286
01:18:22,484 --> 01:18:24,913
LIAM: Just give you a little bit of boost, you
know.

1287
01:18:24,913 --> 01:18:27,286
KHARY: I got a really good feeling about what
you're about to do.

1288
01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:28,431
SAM: Uh-huh.

1289
01:18:28,507 --> 01:18:34,941
KHARY: Like a really good feeling. Like the kind
of feeling that will put a big smile on your face,

1290
01:18:34,941 --> 01:18:38,024
you know, take you back home, make you feel like
there's a big--

1291
01:18:38,024 --> 01:18:42,514
SAM: I'm not interested in a relationship right
now.

1292
01:18:42,514 --> 01:18:47,684
KHARY: Well, this isn't working at all.

1293
01:18:47,684 --> 01:18:49,360
LAURA: Offer her shiny things.

1294
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:54,677
KHARY: Ah, you know what? You know the way this is
turning out, I feel like you can get all kinds of

1295
01:18:54,699 --> 01:18:56,583
gold and silver.

1296
01:18:56,583 --> 01:18:59,233
SAM: Oh, yes! Pretty things. Sure, yes!

1297
01:18:59,233 --> 01:19:00,213
KHARY: Exactly.

1298
01:19:00,213 --> 01:19:03,678
SAM: Yes, absolutely. Give me something.

1299
01:19:03,678 --> 01:19:08,778
KHARY: Oh well, it's waiting for you just down the
hall. All you got to do is take care of a creature

1300
01:19:08,778 --> 01:19:11,028
quietly and quickly.

1301
01:19:11,028 --> 01:19:12,858
SAM: I feel inspired.

1302
01:19:12,948 --> 01:19:18,101
MATT: All right, so make your stealth check and
add a d4 to whatever you roll.

1303
01:19:18,101 --> 01:19:21,203
LAURA: Then I give you a Blessing of the Trickster
for your stealth.

1304
01:19:21,203 --> 01:19:23,323
TRAVIS: What does that do?

1305
01:19:23,323 --> 01:19:25,416
LAURA: You get advantage, Fjord.

1306
01:19:25,416 --> 01:19:26,952
TRAVIS: That's good.

1307
01:19:26,952 --> 01:19:28,012
TRAVIS: Oh god.

1308
01:19:28,012 --> 01:19:29,654
MARISHA: Did you roll the same thing?

1309
01:19:29,654 --> 01:19:32,536
TRAVIS: No, but not much better. Eight.

1310
01:19:32,536 --> 01:19:34,646
LIAM: Oh, low rolls at both?

1311
01:19:34,646 --> 01:19:35,998
TRAVIS: No.

1312
01:19:35,998 --> 01:19:37,468
TALIESIN: Plus a d4.

1313
01:19:37,468 --> 01:19:38,218
SAM: 18.

1314
01:19:38,218 --> 01:19:39,504
MATT: Plus the d4?

1315
01:19:39,504 --> 01:19:41,945
SAM: Oh no, d4. Sorry, not a four, but d4.

1316
01:19:41,945 --> 01:19:44,804
MATT: Not good.

1317
01:19:44,804 --> 01:19:45,741
SAM: 17.

1318
01:19:45,741 --> 01:19:50,706
MATT: 17. Okay. It's just Nott? You're going as
well?

1319
01:19:50,706 --> 01:19:52,555
SAM: He's going too.

1320
01:19:52,555 --> 01:20:00,971
MATT: The two of you begin to make your way down
the hall carefully, ever so carefully, about 60 or

1321
01:20:00,971 --> 01:20:07,000
70 feet towards the bottom where you can both see
the grade begin to turn up. Fjord, you discover

1322
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,960
why you stopped hearing the ball bearing, as
suddenly you take a step and your foot slides up

1323
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:12,420
from under you.

1324
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:13,871
MARISHA: Oh, shit.

1325
01:20:13,871 --> 01:20:21,032
MATT: You try and catch yourself and you manage to
do so, but you dislodge a rock that begins making

1326
01:20:21,032 --> 01:20:29,022
more noise than the ball bearing did. At which
point you hear (growls and howl)

1327
01:20:29,022 --> 01:20:31,439
SAM: Does it see us?

1328
01:20:31,439 --> 01:20:36,274
MATT: It's down below the grade and out of sight.
It's just the rock that began to make its way down.

1329
01:20:36,274 --> 01:20:40,064
TRAVIS: I screwed the pooch. I think y'all need to
fucking join us.

1330
01:20:40,064 --> 01:20:41,174
MARISHA: Come back.

1331
01:20:41,174 --> 01:20:43,463
LAURA: We can't hear you, you're fucking 60 feet
ahead of us.

1332
01:20:43,463 --> 01:20:45,214
TRAVIS: It was a really loud stage whisper.

1333
01:20:45,214 --> 01:20:47,486
(laughter)

1334
01:20:47,486 --> 01:20:49,486
TRAVIS: (echoing) -sper, -sper, -sper.

1335
01:20:49,486 --> 01:20:51,298
(laughter)

1336
01:20:51,328 --> 01:20:58,520
SAM: I will tell them, all right? I'll point back
to them and I will bring out my little piece of

1337
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:06,754
fabric. Wait. No, it's a piece of wire and whisper
into it and send a Message to Caleb that: We've

1338
01:21:06,754 --> 01:21:09,950
been made. Start making your way down here.

1339
01:21:09,950 --> 01:21:12,113
(laughter)

1340
01:21:12,113 --> 01:21:17,317
LIAM: Oh, <i>verdammt</i>. It didn't work, we're in
trouble, they are coming. I think they're coming.

1341
01:21:17,317 --> 01:21:18,568
LAURA: Should we go down the tunnel?

1342
01:21:18,568 --> 01:21:19,944
LIAM: Come back to us please.

1343
01:21:19,944 --> 01:21:21,507
LAURA: Or should we go to them?

1344
01:21:21,507 --> 01:21:22,821
LIAM: I already sent the message.

1345
01:21:22,821 --> 01:21:24,766
MATT: Okay. So!

1346
01:21:24,766 --> 01:21:26,061
SAM: Are we sticking?

1347
01:21:26,061 --> 01:21:26,888
TRAVIS: What did he say?

1348
01:21:26,888 --> 01:21:32,383
SAM: He said "Come back to us." I feel like we're
already here, we should just-- oh gods. What do we

1349
01:21:32,383 --> 01:21:32,793
do?

1350
01:21:32,793 --> 01:21:34,243
TRAVIS: I'm with you.

1351
01:21:34,243 --> 01:21:35,490
SAM: What does that mean?

1352
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:37,442
(laughter)

1353
01:21:37,442 --> 01:21:43,237
TRAVIS: Let's take them on. I feel like I've never
felt. You and me, let's take them.

1354
01:21:43,237 --> 01:21:47,148
SAM: Why are you big men making these weird
speeches to me?!

1355
01:21:47,148 --> 01:21:54,929
(laughter)

1356
01:21:54,929 --> 01:22:01,500
SAM: All right, sure, I feel inspired again. I'll
take a swig.

1357
01:22:01,504 --> 01:22:12,285
MATT: You do take a heavy swig off of your flask,
thank you. Both wait carefully holding your action

1358
01:22:12,285 --> 01:22:20,178
until underneath you can see what emerges below
the lowest part of the curving tunnel roof, a

1359
01:22:20,178 --> 01:22:26,728
gnoll snout begins to protrude past. You can see
the arrow already nocked in the longbow as it

1360
01:22:26,728 --> 01:22:31,621
turns down and turns and glances up the tunnel to
meet your guys' vision.

1361
01:22:32,844 --> 01:22:35,214
TRAVIS: As soon as he fires, I will as well.

1362
01:22:35,214 --> 01:22:38,083
SAM: I will fire, my hand-- how far?

1363
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:40,281
MATT: Right now he's about 30 feet below you.

1364
01:22:40,281 --> 01:22:42,971
SAM: Yeah. I can make that shot. (ping!)

1365
01:22:42,971 --> 01:22:46,461
(laughter)

1366
01:22:46,461 --> 01:22:49,069
MATT: Go ahead and roll an attack.

1367
01:22:49,069 --> 01:22:50,598
TALIESIN: Oh dear.

1368
01:22:50,598 --> 01:22:52,196
SAM: Ten.

1369
01:22:52,196 --> 01:22:53,126
TRAVIS: Oh, me?

1370
01:22:53,126 --> 01:22:54,204
MATT: Yep.

1371
01:22:54,204 --> 01:22:56,473
TRAVIS: 15.

1372
01:22:56,473 --> 01:22:58,543
MATT: Just hits. Misses.

1373
01:22:58,543 --> 01:23:00,944
MARISHA: 15 is the magic number.

1374
01:23:00,944 --> 01:23:02,467
TRAVIS: Can I say my bonus I move my Hex over to
him?

1375
01:23:02,467 --> 01:23:04,978
MATT: At this point, your Hex has faded.

1376
01:23:04,978 --> 01:23:06,209
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

1377
01:23:06,209 --> 01:23:08,460
MATT: Since you guys hadn't left before.

1378
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:10,740
TRAVIS: I tried it. 20 up, 20 down that side.

1379
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:12,773
MATT: Yeah, had you guys taken a short rest when
you were up there or not?

1380
01:23:12,773 --> 01:23:13,973
MARISHA: I was hoping so.

1381
01:23:13,973 --> 01:23:15,278
TRAVIS: Oh, we did say we were going to.

1382
01:23:15,278 --> 01:23:17,570
LAURA: Then it would add another hour up there,
wouldn't it?

1383
01:23:17,570 --> 01:23:21,781
MATT: It would. It's up to you guys. It may or may
not affect things.

1384
01:23:21,781 --> 01:23:23,986
LAURA: I don't really get anything back on short
rest.

1385
01:23:23,986 --> 01:23:25,047
TRAVIS: I do.

1386
01:23:25,047 --> 01:23:26,739
MARISHA: I would get my ki point back.

1387
01:23:26,739 --> 01:23:28,383
LIAM: I would get a spell back, yeah.

1388
01:23:28,383 --> 01:23:34,081
TRAVIS: I think we should. We rescued the
survivors, we gave them a little moment to

1389
01:23:34,081 --> 01:23:35,351
grieve.

1390
01:23:35,351 --> 01:23:36,595
LAURA: I mean there might be more survivors.

1391
01:23:36,595 --> 01:23:38,243
TRAVIS: I know but--

1392
01:23:38,243 --> 01:23:39,837
LAURA: We rescued some survivors.

1393
01:23:39,837 --> 01:23:40,520
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1394
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:41,448
LIAM: We say <i>ja</i>?

1395
01:23:41,448 --> 01:23:42,376
TRAVIS: Yes.

1396
01:23:42,376 --> 01:23:43,304
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

1397
01:23:43,304 --> 01:23:44,734
LAURA: We took a rest.

1398
01:23:44,734 --> 01:23:47,714
MATT: All right, so before we jump into this,
we'll say you took the short rest, which is an

1399
01:23:47,714 --> 01:23:53,654
hour, so you guys can use your hit dice. You
hadn't taken any damage, Shakäste, so you don't

1400
01:23:53,654 --> 01:23:55,614
have to worry about it.

1401
01:23:55,614 --> 01:23:58,412
KHARY: No but I was just thinking about-- because
I did use the Thunderwave.

1402
01:23:58,412 --> 01:24:00,950
MATT: That does not come back on a short rest.

1403
01:24:00,950 --> 01:24:02,471
KHARY: That does not come back, okay.

1404
01:24:02,471 --> 01:24:04,095
MATT: Yeah, it's a long rest for you.

1405
01:24:04,095 --> 01:24:09,085
(background music)

1406
01:24:09,085 --> 01:24:13,215
MARISHA: Jesus, shitty rolls.

1407
01:24:13,215 --> 01:24:18,456
SAM: Is there a way to track the hit dice in
(singing) D&D Beyond?

1408
01:24:18,456 --> 01:24:19,697
MATT: Yes, under hit points.

1409
01:24:19,697 --> 01:24:22,447
TRAVIS: Yeah. You hit short rest and it will pop
up the number of hit dice you have.

1410
01:24:25,387 --> 01:24:27,174
MATT: It's under the short rest.

1411
01:24:27,174 --> 01:24:28,777
LAURA: Yeah, under short rest, not hit--

1412
01:24:28,777 --> 01:24:30,977
SAM: Yeah, okay.

1413
01:24:30,977 --> 01:24:35,774
MATT: All righty, so, with that the case, you've
taken a short rest. Now back to the current

1414
01:24:35,774 --> 01:24:39,774
moment. You both fired. You missed, you succeeded
to hit, go ahead and roll your damage on that.

1415
01:24:39,774 --> 01:24:45,571
TRAVIS: Thank you. 1d10 plus four. That is a ten
plus four, 14.

1416
01:24:45,571 --> 01:24:52,571
MATT: 14 points of damage, all righty. As it looks
up and gets hit in the snout and it looks back up

1417
01:24:52,571 --> 01:24:59,520
and you can see the black, charred exterior of its
head, one of its eyes is now ruined and he

1418
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:03,359
(growls). Its tongue is dangling out. You can see
blood and slobber across the front of its chest as

1419
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:07,357
it looks up and gets ready to release its bow
strike at you since you made the hit. That's going

1420
01:25:07,357 --> 01:25:10,164
to be a 23 to hit.

1421
01:25:10,218 --> 01:25:11,867
TRAVIS: Oh that definitely hits.

1422
01:25:11,867 --> 01:25:15,863
MATT: Natural 18. That's an eight on the die, that
is ten points of piercing damage to you.

1423
01:25:15,863 --> 01:25:16,625
TRAVIS: Damn.

1424
01:25:16,625 --> 01:25:20,798
MARISHA, TRAVIS and LIAM: (singing) Damn, damn,
damn.

1425
01:25:20,798 --> 01:25:23,554
TALIESIN: I was watching this, I was going to head
down this direction anyway.

1426
01:25:23,554 --> 01:25:27,364
MATT: Right, at this point you guys have now
begun to head down, yeah.

1427
01:25:27,364 --> 01:25:30,686
MATT: You guys head down, it's going to take the
better part of the turn to get to where they are,

1428
01:25:30,686 --> 01:25:34,686
unfortunately, because you guys were waiting at
the very top. As soon as you see the lights go off

1429
01:25:35,092 --> 01:25:41,735
suddenly and the impact of the spell from him and
hear the snarling in the distance, you guys begin

1430
01:25:41,735 --> 01:25:49,531
to make a full beeline and it takes you the full
dash and movement to even get beside your allies.

1431
01:25:49,531 --> 01:25:55,246
You guys get another round as well as the gnoll,
so go ahead and make your attacks.

1432
01:25:55,246 --> 01:25:56,309
SAM: All right.

1433
01:25:56,309 --> 01:25:58,399
LAURA: You can do it.

1434
01:25:58,399 --> 01:25:59,776
SAM: I can do it.

1435
01:25:59,776 --> 01:26:00,900
TRAVIS: Here we go.

1436
01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:03,097
SAM: Sure, 18 to hit.

1437
01:26:03,097 --> 01:26:04,141
MATT: 18 hits.

1438
01:26:04,141 --> 01:26:04,836
TRAVIS: 21.

1439
01:26:04,836 --> 01:26:06,949
MATT: Hits. Roll damage. No sneak attack,
unfortunately.

1440
01:26:06,949 --> 01:26:08,163
SAM: Five.

1441
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:10,959
MATT: All right. Damage on you.

1442
01:26:10,959 --> 01:26:16,778
TRAVIS: On my bonus action, I'll cast Hex as well.
That's five points of necrotic.

1443
01:26:16,778 --> 01:26:20,295
KHARY: Is my Guidance still helping at all?

1444
01:26:20,295 --> 01:26:23,146
MATT: The Guidance only helps for the next six
seconds, so it helped him with the stealth check

1445
01:26:23,146 --> 01:26:25,578
originally. You can do it whenever you want to as
an action.

1446
01:26:25,578 --> 01:26:28,476
TRAVIS: Eight points of damage, five necrotic for
13 total.

1447
01:26:28,476 --> 01:26:34,573
MATT: As the gnoll pulling back its arrows, about
to give out a large bellowing cry, makes a large

1448
01:26:34,573 --> 01:26:39,474
inhale as it pulls back a second arrow and then
both of you slam into it and watch as it falls to

1449
01:26:39,474 --> 01:26:43,251
the ground, dropping its weapons that clatter
against the stonework. It's not longer moving as

1450
01:26:43,251 --> 01:26:44,648
you guys catch up.

1451
01:26:44,648 --> 01:26:49,478
LAURA: I go running past them right as they do it
and cut its ears off.

1452
01:26:49,478 --> 01:26:52,368
TALIESIN: I'm opening up the jar. There you are.

1453
01:26:52,368 --> 01:26:53,548
LAURA: Thank you.

1454
01:26:53,548 --> 01:26:55,741
TRAVIS: Pull it back into the tunnel!

1455
01:26:55,741 --> 01:26:57,620
LAURA: Oh okay. I do that.

1456
01:26:57,783 --> 01:27:00,259
MATT: Okay. You drag it back in, while you're down
you make perception checks, please.

1457
01:27:00,259 --> 01:27:02,102
TALIESIN: Both of us?

1458
01:27:02,102 --> 01:27:03,477
SAM: Her forearms are amazing.

1459
01:27:03,477 --> 01:27:06,597
MATT: If you're helping yeah, both of you.

1460
01:27:06,597 --> 01:27:08,626
MARISHA: They're bats, just baseball bats with
arms.

1461
01:27:08,626 --> 01:27:09,518
LAURA: 15.

1462
01:27:09,518 --> 01:27:10,635
TALIESIN: 13.

1463
01:27:10,635 --> 01:27:14,714
MATT: As you rush down and grab the body, you
glance up and whereas previously he described

1464
01:27:14,714 --> 01:27:21,364
there was the singular gnoll and the two other
skeletal ones in the opposite side, it appears

1465
01:27:21,364 --> 01:27:26,958
that since it was given some indication of nearby
sounds and it made that brief call before it began

1466
01:27:26,958 --> 01:27:31,410
to approach, there are a few more gnolls that have
appeared at the top of the platform above where

1467
01:27:31,410 --> 01:27:32,491
the stairs crest.

1468
01:27:32,491 --> 01:27:33,795
LAURA: Do they see us?

1469
01:27:36,795 --> 01:27:40,288
MATT: No, they do not at the moment, but only
because they're not looking at your direction. As

1470
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:43,357
soon as you see it you immediately drag the body
out of the way. I would like you both make a

1471
01:27:43,357 --> 01:27:46,334
stealth check to try to quietly drag the body
back.

1472
01:27:48,494 --> 01:27:49,949
LAURA: 16.

1473
01:27:49,949 --> 01:27:50,895
TALIESIN: 20.

1474
01:27:50,925 --> 01:27:55,963
MATT: You both don't drag it, you both grab an arm
and a leg and very painfully lift it up without

1475
01:27:55,963 --> 01:27:59,514
making any sound and pull it out of range up the
grade out of view as you watch one of the gnolls

1476
01:27:59,516 --> 01:28:04,170
turns its face in your direction barely passing
seeing you guys yank it out of sight.

1477
01:28:04,170 --> 01:28:06,695
LAURA: (whispering) There's a lot more guys out
there.

1478
01:28:06,695 --> 01:28:08,515
MARISHA: (whispering) How many?

1479
01:28:08,529 --> 01:28:11,500
MATT: You saw three visually appear.

1480
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:13,207
LAURA: I saw three visually.

1481
01:28:13,207 --> 01:28:15,203
TRAVIS: Fucking Beau and her ball bearings.

1482
01:28:15,203 --> 01:28:16,977
SAM: Why did you drop a ball bearing down there?

1483
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:20,976
MATT: To give you perspective on this, because it
looks like we're going on that direction.

1484
01:28:20,976 --> 01:28:23,455
(cheering)

1485
01:28:23,455 --> 01:28:24,864
LAURA: Oh god this means that--

1486
01:28:24,864 --> 01:28:27,948
MARISHA: It's like a motion simulator ride. Whoa!

1487
01:28:27,948 --> 01:28:32,335
TALIESIN: Fun fact, Matt's house is actually made
of Dwarven Forge.

1488
01:28:32,335 --> 01:28:34,574
MARISHA: It's true.

1489
01:28:34,574 --> 01:28:37,161
TALIESIN: Every wall, the kitchen.

1490
01:28:37,161 --> 01:28:38,415
LAURA: That would be amazing.

1491
01:28:38,415 --> 01:28:40,784
TALIESIN: It's just Dwarven Forge all the way
through.

1492
01:28:40,784 --> 01:28:42,597
MARISHA: No, I don't know.

1493
01:28:42,597 --> 01:28:45,923
LIAM: You haven't lived until you've slept on
Dwarven Forge.

1494
01:28:45,923 --> 01:28:47,165
MATT: You now see.

1495
01:28:47,165 --> 01:28:49,951
MARISHA: Or our bed's not on braziers, no.

1496
01:28:49,951 --> 01:28:55,519
LAURA and LIAM: Critical Role, Critical Role.

1497
01:28:55,519 --> 01:28:58,153
LIAM: Oh god, we've got to stop.

1498
01:28:58,153 --> 01:29:00,414
TALIESIN: I know, this has to end.

1499
01:29:00,414 --> 01:29:03,511
MATT: This leads into the grade that head up in an
angle here where you guys originally shot the

1500
01:29:03,511 --> 01:29:06,308
gnoll and dragged him out of the way.

1501
01:29:06,308 --> 01:29:07,518
LIAM: We are down that way?

1502
01:29:07,518 --> 01:29:08,979
MATT: You guys are over--

1503
01:29:08,979 --> 01:29:10,511
LIAM: Over this way?

1504
01:29:10,511 --> 01:29:14,936
MATT: You're up in the tunnel here. It angles down
there and this is where--

1505
01:29:14,941 --> 01:29:19,506
LAURA: Oh no. They're coming. (whispering) They
were about to look in this direction, but they

1506
01:29:19,506 --> 01:29:23,383
weren't quite looking in that direction when we
dragged the body out.

1507
01:29:24,383 --> 01:29:26,536
MARISHA: (whispering) Okay.

1508
01:29:29,506 --> 01:29:31,830
KHARY: They're not exactly--

1509
01:29:31,830 --> 01:29:36,425
MATT: They haven't noticed anything yet. You guys
are up in this way, and this is the layout here.

1510
01:29:36,425 --> 01:29:39,930
LAURA: Fjord, what do we do?

1511
01:29:41,930 --> 01:29:45,644
SAM: Don't do anything yet. We have to figure out
what we're doing.

1512
01:29:45,644 --> 01:29:53,068
KHARY: Well, I'm meaning simply as a strategy.
Should we use something to distract them? Since

1513
01:29:53,068 --> 01:29:59,387
they're already not looking our way, so that we
could get a few shots at their back.

1514
01:29:59,387 --> 01:30:02,157
LAURA: Can you send the Grand Duchess in?

1515
01:30:02,157 --> 01:30:05,192
KHARY: I absolutely will. Can we start there?

1516
01:30:05,192 --> 01:30:07,226
MATT: You may. Yeah.

1517
01:30:07,226 --> 01:30:10,153
KHARY: Let's do that. Find a safe perch, my dear.

1518
01:30:10,153 --> 01:30:15,413
MATT: The Grand Duchess makes her way down to the
tunnel up. Let's see if they see her.

1519
01:30:15,413 --> 01:30:17,553
SAM: Is she really royalty?

1520
01:30:17,553 --> 01:30:19,663
KHARY: That's what she told me.

1521
01:30:19,663 --> 01:30:22,617
LAURA: Did she used to be a person and you shrunk
her down?

1522
01:30:22,617 --> 01:30:26,245
KHARY: No, she is who she is, baby. Just like
you.

1523
01:30:26,245 --> 01:30:31,420
MATT: She passes them over. There is one perch up
on the side of the wall right above where this

1524
01:30:31,420 --> 01:30:37,532
large pit is on the opposite end. She perches
right over the side as two of the gnolls are still

1525
01:30:37,532 --> 01:30:44,449
(growls). One of them begins to look over the
table and underneath for any possible source of

1526
01:30:44,449 --> 01:30:53,048
the noise earlier. One of them glances over his
shoulder as the Duchess enters, begins to pull an

1527
01:30:53,048 --> 01:30:54,515
arrow out of the quiver.

1528
01:30:54,515 --> 01:30:56,852
KHARY: Come back here, baby.

1529
01:30:56,852 --> 01:30:58,192
MATT: (bird noise). (growl).

1530
01:30:58,192 --> 01:31:01,364
KHARY: Thaumaturgy.

1531
01:31:01,364 --> 01:31:03,444
SAM: Oh no! It's on!

1532
01:31:03,444 --> 01:31:04,864
MARISHA: Do it.

1533
01:31:04,864 --> 01:31:06,715
KHARY: Thaumaturgy. I'm sorry.

1534
01:31:06,715 --> 01:31:09,474
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my bonus action just
before this happens and I'm going to activate the

1535
01:31:09,474 --> 01:31:10,485
second sword.

1536
01:31:10,485 --> 01:31:12,994
MATT: Okay, you reduce your max hit points.

1537
01:31:12,994 --> 01:31:15,896
TRAVIS: I roll to maintain concentration because
he hit me after I cast Hex.

1538
01:31:15,896 --> 01:31:18,760
MATT: Yes, please. Constitution saving throw.

1539
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:22,213
TRAVIS: Oh no. Yeah, that's a six.

1540
01:31:22,213 --> 01:31:25,072
MATT: Six, no, that's a failure. You lose Hex,
sorry buddy.

1541
01:31:25,072 --> 01:31:26,177
LAURA: Oh no.

1542
01:31:26,177 --> 01:31:27,555
TRAVIS: Got to be honest with him.

1543
01:31:27,555 --> 01:31:35,297
KHARY: Thaumaturgy. Can I brighten the room? How
dark is it in here?

1544
01:31:35,297 --> 01:31:38,813
MATT: It's pitch black aside from the globes of
light that he has. There's nothing to make

1545
01:31:38,813 --> 01:31:40,890
brighter in there.

1546
01:31:40,890 --> 01:31:42,547
LIAM: It's bright behind us, not in front of us so
much.

1547
01:31:42,547 --> 01:31:45,044
KHARY: Let's see, then, if it's--

1548
01:31:46,464 --> 01:31:49,948
LAURA: You can shake the ground, though.

1549
01:31:49,948 --> 01:31:59,073
KHARY: Yes, let's shake the ground so however well
he thinks he can aim takes him off kilter.

1550
01:31:59,073 --> 01:32:04,461
MATT: For that instance, make a standard wisdom
check for me. Roll a d20 and add your wisdom

1551
01:32:04,461 --> 01:32:06,419
modifier which I think is--

1552
01:32:06,419 --> 01:32:09,000
LIAM: Oh, that's a 19 natural roll.

1553
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:12,945
MATT: As you feel the Duchess return to you and
just past the vision as the Duchess passes over

1554
01:32:12,945 --> 01:32:20,243
you hear the sound of the fingers gliding across
the bowstring. You hear the creak of the wood as

1555
01:32:20,243 --> 01:32:25,442
it's pulled back. You know exactly what that sound
means as you see through the Duchess's eyes. You

1556
01:32:25,442 --> 01:32:33,228
focus on the ground below and cause it to quake
somewhat. Rolled a natural five plus four, with

1557
01:32:33,228 --> 01:32:39,901
that shaking it causes the-- it's very localized
in the area, the gnoll (yip) as it does, it

1558
01:32:39,901 --> 01:32:48,391
releases the arrow and it whips past and shatters
across the rock. The Duchess returns to your shoulder.

1559
01:32:48,391 --> 01:32:51,421
KHARY: Well, now I'm pissed.

1560
01:32:51,421 --> 01:32:54,559
SAM: Do they know we're here now?

1561
01:32:54,559 --> 01:32:57,928
LAURA: He saw the bird come back this way so
maybe--

1562
01:32:57,928 --> 01:33:00,244
LIAM and SAM: It's just a bird.

1563
01:33:00,244 --> 01:33:02,162
LIAM: He might have even thought it was a bat.

1564
01:33:02,162 --> 01:33:04,693
SAM: Should we all turn into birds and confuse
him?

1565
01:33:04,693 --> 01:33:06,666
LAURA: Do you know how to do that?

1566
01:33:06,666 --> 01:33:08,153
SAM and LAURA: I could try.

1567
01:33:08,153 --> 01:33:11,393
KHARY: Let's try later. Why don't we do things
we've done before?

1568
01:33:11,393 --> 01:33:14,197
(laughter)

1569
01:33:17,507 --> 01:33:20,178
MATT: What are you guys doing?

1570
01:33:20,178 --> 01:33:21,561
MARISHA: Are we doing this?

1571
01:33:21,561 --> 01:33:22,666
LAURA: Let's fucking go.

1572
01:33:22,666 --> 01:33:27,671
SAM: We're going to go in or-- this doesn't seem
very smart! I don't know.

1573
01:33:27,671 --> 01:33:32,816
LAURA: I rub her head and give her a little
blessing. Don't you worry. You keep hiding

1574
01:33:32,816 --> 01:33:33,942
whenever you need it.

1575
01:33:33,942 --> 01:33:35,403
SAM: What is this blessing?

1576
01:33:35,403 --> 01:33:36,988
LAURA: It gives you advantage on stealth checks.

1577
01:33:36,988 --> 01:33:38,526
SAM: Oh, okay. Thank you.

1578
01:33:39,886 --> 01:33:43,451
MATT: If this is the case, what are you guys
doing?

1579
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:45,152
MARISHA: Do we get a surprise round?

1580
01:33:45,152 --> 01:33:46,852
SAM: No, they know we're here.

1581
01:33:46,852 --> 01:33:49,572
KHARY: No, they <i>don't</i> know we're here.

1582
01:33:49,572 --> 01:33:53,736
MARISHA: Or an earthquake. We're in a shaft!
Things shake a lot.

1583
01:33:53,736 --> 01:33:57,720
MATT: They're aware of something in the vicinity.
The first gnoll announced there was something

1584
01:33:57,720 --> 01:34:00,539
fishy. They don't know what it is or where you
are, but they're on guard.

1585
01:34:01,489 --> 01:34:05,956
LIAM: Surprised is like a condition. Like poison,
but they know something is--

1586
01:34:05,956 --> 01:34:07,668
LAURA: Not surprised.

1587
01:34:07,668 --> 01:34:19,170
KHARY: If I used Sacred Flame on one-- because if
it's dark in there and one of them burst into

1588
01:34:19,170 --> 01:34:23,385
flames wouldn't they all look in that direction?

1589
01:34:23,385 --> 01:34:24,723
MATT: It's possible.

1590
01:34:24,723 --> 01:34:26,312
KHARY: Let's try that.

1591
01:34:26,312 --> 01:34:29,277
LAURA: I could Sacred Flame him in the exact same
time.

1592
01:34:29,277 --> 01:34:31,983
TRAVIS: While we're waiting, can I cast Armor of
Agathys on myself?

1593
01:34:31,983 --> 01:34:32,810
MATT: You may.

1594
01:34:32,810 --> 01:34:35,679
KHARY: I like this.

1595
01:34:35,679 --> 01:34:41,439
TRAVIS: (hissing sound) I pull the moisture 
out of the air and it forms frost all over me.

1596
01:34:42,509 --> 01:34:44,932
MARISHA: It's got a little moss on it from the
cave?

1597
01:34:44,932 --> 01:34:51,018
MATT: As you have this conversation you turn back
and you watch as Fjord, the rather handsome

1598
01:34:51,018 --> 01:34:55,000
looking half-orc, finishes muttering something
under his breath and the shadows coalesce into

1599
01:34:55,000 --> 01:35:00,858
this dark, cold, icy armor that shatter into bits
of shards around the exterior of his leather

1600
01:35:00,858 --> 01:35:03,751
armor. You watch as this mist rises off of it.

1601
01:35:03,751 --> 01:35:07,059
TRAVIS: Everybody chill.

1602
01:35:08,229 --> 01:35:11,217
LIAM: No, you ruined it! It was so good!

1603
01:35:11,217 --> 01:35:15,498
MARISHA: It wasn't cool when Arnold said it.

1604
01:35:15,498 --> 01:35:17,252
TRAVIS: Wait, everybody. Be cool.

1605
01:35:17,252 --> 01:35:21,394
(laughter)

1606
01:35:21,394 --> 01:35:25,565
SAM: Stay frosty? Stay frosty.

1607
01:35:25,565 --> 01:35:33,923
LAURA: I pull my sickle out so I'm prepared for
actual up-front combat.

1608
01:35:33,923 --> 01:35:36,745
TALIESIN: I've got both of those sticks going. I'm
ready for this.

1609
01:35:36,745 --> 01:35:40,151
MATT: This guy's moved forward to here. This guy's
moved forward to there. They're in the process of

1610
01:35:40,151 --> 01:35:43,168
searching the area, looking down the tunnel.

1611
01:35:43,168 --> 01:35:46,374
LAURA: Which one do you want to hit? The orange
one, the gray one, or the black one?

1612
01:35:46,374 --> 01:35:48,067
KHARY: Did we see those other ones over there?

1613
01:35:48,067 --> 01:35:51,559
MATT: You saw them, the skeletal ones there.

1614
01:35:51,559 --> 01:35:56,258
KHARY: That's what I thought. I thought my baby
saw them. I say, I think we need to get those

1615
01:35:56,258 --> 01:36:00,016
fellows to turn back and look at those fellows.

1616
01:36:00,016 --> 01:36:03,031
LAURA: We can't see those guys to Sacred Flame
them.

1617
01:36:03,031 --> 01:36:05,469
KHARY: I can't see them anymore?

1618
01:36:05,469 --> 01:36:10,158
MATT: You guys are up in this tower right now, so
you'd have to send Duchess back in to see.

1619
01:36:10,158 --> 01:36:13,234
KHARY: Isn't that always the way?

1620
01:36:13,234 --> 01:36:17,249
LAURA: We could get the one in the back, and then
the other two might look at him.

1621
01:36:17,249 --> 01:36:18,535
KHARY: I think that's a great idea, darling.

1622
01:36:18,535 --> 01:36:20,036
LAURA: Let's do it.

1623
01:36:20,036 --> 01:36:24,924
LIAM: Can I say, I change my mind every five
minutes about whether this group was a good idea

1624
01:36:24,924 --> 01:36:29,546
or a terrible idea, and I'm listening to these
chuckleheads talk to each other, and I'm waiting

1625
01:36:29,546 --> 01:36:33,715
to cast Blur on myself when it looks like
everybody's going to do something, but I'm waiting

1626
01:36:33,715 --> 01:36:35,658
until the last minute.

1627
01:36:35,658 --> 01:36:37,025
LAURA: I knew it was Blur!

1628
01:36:37,025 --> 01:36:39,535
LIAM: Good for you. You get a doughnut.

1629
01:36:40,505 --> 01:36:43,619
KHARY: Sacred Flame, on the gentleman in blue.

1630
01:36:43,619 --> 01:36:47,835
LAURA: At the same time I see his little reed
flick, I'm going to swirl my sickle around and

1631
01:36:47,835 --> 01:36:49,346
cast Toll the Dead.

1632
01:36:49,346 --> 01:36:50,795
MATT: All right, on this guy there?

1633
01:36:50,795 --> 01:36:52,696
LAURA and KHARY: Yeah.

1634
01:36:52,696 --> 01:36:56,695
MATT: As you guys slowly bring your way to the
base-- which in order to get you in the space

1635
01:36:56,695 --> 01:37:04,464
where you can see them, that would put both of you
rushing right down to the base in that area. If I

1636
01:37:04,464 --> 01:37:06,922
can get a marching order to where the rest of you
are, by the way.

1637
01:37:06,922 --> 01:37:09,622
LIAM: Hey, I'll be in the back.

1638
01:37:09,622 --> 01:37:11,386
MARISHA: I'll take the front.

1639
01:37:11,386 --> 01:37:13,460
TALIESIN: Let's take a line of the three of us, at
least.

1640
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:15,030
TRAVIS: Yep. I'm good with that.

1641
01:37:15,030 --> 01:37:19,637
MATT: You guys rush forward to take the line as
they--

1642
01:37:19,637 --> 01:37:20,833
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Linemen.

1643
01:37:20,833 --> 01:37:22,845
SAM: I'll be back with Caleb.

1644
01:37:22,845 --> 01:37:25,599
MARISHA: Yeah. I knew what that meant.

1645
01:37:25,599 --> 01:37:28,004
TRAVIS: You going to be a guard or a tackle?

1646
01:37:28,004 --> 01:37:31,499
MARISHA: Oh. Tackle. I'm probably a guard.

1647
01:37:31,499 --> 01:37:35,759
MATT: As you all rush in below, you both release
Sacred Flame and Toll the Dead on the guy in the

1648
01:37:35,759 --> 01:37:42,596
blue. That's a wisdom saving throw for Sacred
Flame, I believe it is?

1649
01:37:42,596 --> 01:37:46,686
LAURA: It's a dex save for Sacred Flame and a
wisdom save for Toll the Dead.

1650
01:37:46,686 --> 01:37:49,460
MATT: That's right. A wisdom save for you, that's
a 13?

1651
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:50,238
LAURA: 13.

1652
01:37:50,238 --> 01:37:56,977
MATT: Yeah, it succeeds. Sorry. For you, it's 13
as well for your DC. That is a five.

1653
01:37:56,977 --> 01:38:00,509
LAURA: You couldn't have them roll that for me?

1654
01:38:00,509 --> 01:38:01,430
MATT: Sorry.

1655
01:38:01,430 --> 01:38:04,328
(laughter)

1656
01:38:08,328 --> 01:38:12,000
SAM: It's Crystal Pepsi.

1657
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,434
LAURA: I really love Crystal Pepsi.

1658
01:38:14,434 --> 01:38:17,425
TALIESIN: Original run.

1659
01:38:17,425 --> 01:38:23,650
MATT: Roll damage for the Sacred Flame, which
should be-- What's the damage on the spell?

1660
01:38:23,650 --> 01:38:34,415
KHARY: The damage on the Sacred Flame is-- The
spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you--

1661
01:38:34,415 --> 01:38:37,164
MATT: Yeah, so it's 1d8. Go ahead and roll 1d8
radiant damage.

1662
01:38:37,164 --> 01:38:39,598
KHARY: 1d8 is this thing?

1663
01:38:41,315 --> 01:38:42,689
KHARY: One.

1664
01:38:42,689 --> 01:38:45,505
LAURA: Ugh. That's okay. It was for visual
anyway.

1665
01:38:45,505 --> 01:38:47,057
KHARY: It was. That's true. I would have wanted
the--

1666
01:38:47,057 --> 01:38:49,610
MATT: You watch the light burst in.

1667
01:38:49,610 --> 01:38:52,401
LIAM: I've pulled the ripcord on Blur if they're
doing that.

1668
01:38:52,401 --> 01:38:57,073
MATT: You cast Blur. That all happens in a quick
instant as they rushed forward and you guys caught

1669
01:38:57,073 --> 01:38:59,334
up. Now we're rolling initiative.

1670
01:38:59,334 --> 01:39:00,690
MARISHA: Fuck yeah.

1671
01:39:00,690 --> 01:39:02,613
TRAVIS: Let's get this one right.

1672
01:39:02,613 --> 01:39:05,115
MARISHA: Son of a fuck!

1673
01:39:05,115 --> 01:39:10,457
LIAM: There is a vision of me before me and also
behind me, flickering in and out of view.

1674
01:39:10,457 --> 01:39:13,440
MATT: 25 to 20. 25 to 20 anybody?

1675
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:14,222
KHARY: 20.

1676
01:39:14,222 --> 01:39:17,812
TALIESIN: A real initiative roll. That's
something.

1677
01:39:18,812 --> 01:39:22,108
MATT: All right. 20 to 15?

1678
01:39:22,108 --> 01:39:24,448
SAM: Nobody got 20 to 15?

1679
01:39:24,448 --> 01:39:30,854
TRAVIS: Can I call you Shaq?

1680
01:39:30,854 --> 01:39:32,537
MATT: 15 to ten?

1681
01:39:32,537 --> 01:39:33,091
KHARY: No.

1682
01:39:33,091 --> 01:39:34,456
TALIESIN: 13.

1683
01:39:34,456 --> 01:39:35,213
LAURA: Ten.

1684
01:39:35,213 --> 01:39:36,514
SAM: 11.

1685
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:40,451
TRAVIS: Molly, Nott, and Jester?

1686
01:39:40,451 --> 01:39:42,061
MATT: Jester, you got ten?

1687
01:39:42,061 --> 01:39:43,388
LAURA: I got ten.

1688
01:39:43,388 --> 01:39:47,193
SAM: Ten to 15. Ooh, boy.

1689
01:39:47,193 --> 01:39:48,476
TALIESIN: Wow, really?

1690
01:39:48,496 --> 01:39:51,618
MATT: Ten to five?

1691
01:39:51,618 --> 01:39:52,789
LIAM: <i>Siebzehn</i>.

1692
01:39:52,789 --> 01:39:55,296
MARISHA: Eight.

1693
01:39:56,608 --> 01:39:58,764
TRAVIS: Caleb's before Beau?

1694
01:39:58,764 --> 01:40:00,405
MARISHA: What's zip-- seven?

1695
01:40:00,405 --> 01:40:01,806
LIAM: <i>Siebzehn</i> is seven.

1696
01:40:01,806 --> 01:40:03,193
MARISHA: No, I am.

1697
01:40:03,193 --> 01:40:05,203
MATT: Beau, what did you get?

1698
01:40:05,203 --> 01:40:06,573
MARISHA: I rolled a nine.

1699
01:40:06,573 --> 01:40:08,213
MARISHA: Five plus four. <i>Nein.</i>

1700
01:40:09,477 --> 01:40:12,116
TRAVIS: I rolled a three.

1701
01:40:12,116 --> 01:40:14,241
LAURA: Oh, Fjord.

1702
01:40:17,501 --> 01:40:23,868
MATT: As the gnolls are all clumping together,
preparing for your onslaught right at the edge of

1703
01:40:23,868 --> 01:40:27,698
the hole with the furniture on the opposite side
there, the two skeletal gnolls who are getting

1704
01:40:27,698 --> 01:40:30,779
ready to rush into the fray. Top of the round is
Shakäste.

1705
01:40:30,779 --> 01:40:35,753
KHARY: Let's see. Frostbite.

1706
01:40:35,753 --> 01:40:38,264
MATT: Okay. Against which one?

1707
01:40:38,264 --> 01:40:47,960
KHARY: Let's see. Oh, wait, first of all, they
burst into flames, this gentleman burst into

1708
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:52,590
flames, and when that happened, what did these
gentlemen-- how did these gentlemen react?

1709
01:40:52,590 --> 01:40:56,393
MATT: The two other gnolls glance over at the
side, and then look towards the tunnel where you

1710
01:40:56,393 --> 01:40:59,245
guys were. It didn't seem like it was much of a
distraction for them, unfortunately, in the moment.

1711
01:40:59,245 --> 01:41:02,555
LAURA: Right as we all ran in at the same time.

1712
01:41:02,555 --> 01:41:08,842
MATT: Unfortunately, it wasn't a sourceless
cluster as you guys all made your way to the base.

1713
01:41:08,847 --> 01:41:13,286
KHARY: All right then, I say the one closest to
us, I will hit with Frostbite.

1714
01:41:13,286 --> 01:41:15,440
MATT: All right. Would that be that one there?

1715
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:17,516
KHARY: That would be that fellow.

1716
01:41:17,516 --> 01:41:22,395
MATT: All right, go for it. Frostbite he has to
roll against your DC, so I roll it for you. That

1717
01:41:22,395 --> 01:41:24,649
is a natural one, so go ahead and roll damage on
that.

1718
01:41:24,649 --> 01:41:28,088
KHARY: All right. That is the diamond?

1719
01:41:28,088 --> 01:41:31,160
MATT: It should be, is that a d8 for that one as
well?

1720
01:41:31,160 --> 01:41:33,696
KHARY: Yeah. Wait, by 1d6.

1721
01:41:33,696 --> 01:41:40,280
MATT: Okay, so it would be d6. I'm pretty sure
it's a d6 for the cantrip.

1722
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:42,682
KHARY: 1d6? Is that this one?

1723
01:41:42,682 --> 01:41:45,847
LIAM: That is that one, yeah. The cube is a six.
Hey, a three.

1724
01:41:47,058 --> 01:41:51,157
MATT: Three points of cold damage to him, and he
has disadvantage on his next attack roll.

1725
01:41:51,157 --> 01:41:55,860
Suddenly, a similar cold to what you saw coalesced
around the armor of Fjord, this time it's

1726
01:41:55,860 --> 01:42:00,406
attacking and freezing inward, and you watch as
the gnoll (gnoll pain sounds). It's shaking

1727
01:42:00,406 --> 01:42:04,540
briefly, you watch as its muscles are beginning to
slow down and become sluggish. Do you want to

1728
01:42:04,540 --> 01:42:06,805
move, or do you want to stay where you're put?

1729
01:42:06,805 --> 01:42:09,942
KHARY: Let's see. Actually, I feel pretty good
right behind these fellows.

1730
01:42:09,942 --> 01:42:16,034
MATT: All right, so you stay there. That ends your
turn. The gnolls will now go. The three of them

1731
01:42:16,034 --> 01:42:20,653
are going to begin to back away, and they're all
going to take strikes with their bow.

1732
01:42:20,653 --> 01:42:22,166
SAM: Ranged attackers.

1733
01:42:22,166 --> 01:42:27,488
MATT: They all pull out their arrows, and each are
going to make a strike. The one you frostbit is

1734
01:42:27,488 --> 01:42:29,316
going to attack you, it has disadvantage.

1735
01:42:29,316 --> 01:42:32,129
SAM: Guys, let's all cluster up at the bottom of
the stairs.

1736
01:42:32,129 --> 01:42:33,578
MARISHA: Sounds great. Yeah.

1737
01:42:33,578 --> 01:42:40,246
MATT: It was a three and a two, with disadvantage,
so no, it misses you entirely. It actually gets

1738
01:42:40,246 --> 01:42:42,467
partially caught in the 'fro, and makes its way to
the back.

1739
01:42:43,487 --> 01:42:47,905
KHARY: Oh man, I've got beads in that thing, baby.
Got to be careful.

1740
01:42:47,905 --> 01:42:55,376
MATT: Missed them all, thankfully. The next attack
in the front is going to be against Beau, and then

1741
01:42:55,376 --> 01:43:00,569
one's going to be against Molly, since you guys
are the most visually impressive of the front row

1742
01:43:00,569 --> 01:43:05,004
color-wise. You blend into the surroundings a
little bit comparatively, so against Molly-- Man,

1743
01:43:05,004 --> 01:43:06,503
they cannot roll, that is a six.

1744
01:43:06,503 --> 01:43:08,891
TALIESIN: I slice it, catch it in the spin.

1745
01:43:08,891 --> 01:43:14,359
MATT: (grinding sound) Just grinding toothpicks.
The one versus you, Beau, that is a 14.

1746
01:43:14,359 --> 01:43:15,447
MARISHA: Miss.

1747
01:43:15,447 --> 01:43:17,256
MATT: Dodge out of the way.

1748
01:43:17,256 --> 01:43:19,879
SAM: Devil sticks?

1749
01:43:19,879 --> 01:43:23,864
KHARY: I think that's what they-- yeah. I seem to
remember them being--

1750
01:43:23,864 --> 01:43:25,206
MATT: All right, Molly, you're up.

1751
01:43:25,206 --> 01:43:31,510
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. I'm going to hop up and move
to the left. I'm not even going to use the real

1752
01:43:31,510 --> 01:43:36,472
stairs, I'm going to get to the side up on that
barrel over there.

1753
01:43:36,472 --> 01:43:37,931
MATT: There?

1754
01:43:37,931 --> 01:43:45,745
TALIESIN: Yeah, and use Vicious Mockery on the one
closest to us.

1755
01:43:45,745 --> 01:43:46,835
MATT: That's a 15 on the saving throw.

1756
01:43:46,835 --> 01:43:48,348
TALIESIN: So he's fine.

1757
01:43:48,348 --> 01:43:51,590
MATT: So he's fine, unfortunately.

1758
01:43:51,590 --> 01:43:53,546
TALIESIN: (devilish voice) Ack! Fuck! Can't finish
it!

1759
01:43:53,546 --> 01:43:55,906
(laughter)

1760
01:43:55,906 --> 01:43:57,235
TRAVIS: Talk tough.

1761
01:43:57,235 --> 01:43:59,113
MATT: You can keep using your movement if you want
or you can stay put.

1762
01:43:59,113 --> 01:44:05,882
TALIESIN: I'm going to get to the-- No, I'm going
to stay back because I'm a little-- yeah, I'm

1763
01:44:05,882 --> 01:44:07,372
going to let other people come up first.

1764
01:44:07,372 --> 01:44:09,190
MATT: Okay. Ending your turn Molly, it's Nott,
you're up.

1765
01:44:09,190 --> 01:44:15,529
SAM: Oh. Excuse me, pardon me, pardon me, excuse
me. I'm going to cut through the front and go as

1766
01:44:15,529 --> 01:44:17,500
far up the stairs as I can go.

1767
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:19,631
MATT: (counting) 30.

1768
01:44:19,631 --> 01:44:20,392
LIAM: Careful.

1769
01:44:21,492 --> 01:44:26,590
SAM: Take one shot, at the one who looks frosty.

1770
01:44:26,590 --> 01:44:27,967
MATT: That's that guy there?

1771
01:44:27,967 --> 01:44:29,179
SAM: Yeah. (crossbow sound)

1772
01:44:29,179 --> 01:44:30,688
MATT: Make the attack.

1773
01:44:30,688 --> 01:44:32,549
SAM: Oh, boy, 12.

1774
01:44:32,549 --> 01:44:36,967
MATT: 12, it does hit, and then splinters off the
armor. Off the ice in particular.

1775
01:44:36,967 --> 01:44:43,336
SAM: (groans) I will, bonus action, go right back to
where I was.

1776
01:44:44,516 --> 01:44:48,368
MATT: (goblin yell) You rush back down. That
finishes your turn Nott, Jester, you're up.

1777
01:44:48,368 --> 01:44:49,614
SAM: Pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, pardon me.

1778
01:44:49,614 --> 01:44:58,956
LAURA: I'm going to move forward, up to the other
side. Yeah, can I see them?

1779
01:44:58,956 --> 01:45:00,200
MATT: You can see them.

1780
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:03,972
LAURA: You know what? Fuck it. Should I do this?

1781
01:45:03,972 --> 01:45:05,989
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Always.

1782
01:45:05,989 --> 01:45:08,275
LAURA: Fuck it. I'm going to climb up the stairs.

1783
01:45:08,275 --> 01:45:12,759
SAM: (imitating Laura) Climb up the stairs. Hello,
gentleman.

1784
01:45:12,759 --> 01:45:15,568
LAURA: Then I'm going to Invoke Duplicity!

1785
01:45:15,568 --> 01:45:17,490
SAM: Shaka-pow.

1786
01:45:17,490 --> 01:45:19,870
MATT: Where's it going to appear?

1787
01:45:19,870 --> 01:45:26,769
LAURA: It's going to appear next to the-- yeah,
right there.

1788
01:45:26,769 --> 01:45:27,700
MATT: Right there?

1789
01:45:27,700 --> 01:45:29,366
LAURA: She's going to be like--

1790
01:45:29,366 --> 01:45:35,018
MATT: The one gnoll goes (growls). All right.
Seems immediately confused by the appearance of

1791
01:45:35,018 --> 01:45:36,965
two Jesters in proximity.

1792
01:45:37,476 --> 01:45:40,045
MATT: That's your action. That's your go?

1793
01:45:40,045 --> 01:45:44,379
LAURA: Yeah, and then can I use my movement to
crouch behind this table?

1794
01:45:44,379 --> 01:45:46,684
MATT: Nah, that's as far as you can get with your
movement, unfortunately.

1795
01:45:46,684 --> 01:45:48,038
LAURA: Okie dokie.

1796
01:45:49,516 --> 01:45:57,710
MATT: Ending Jester's turn. These two
guys come into play. This one rushes up and swings

1797
01:45:57,710 --> 01:46:07,507
at the illusory Jester; passes through, no effect.
This one's going to-- five, six. It does not have

1798
01:46:07,507 --> 01:46:10,982
a ranged attack, so instead it's going to rush
forward and engage with you right there.

1799
01:46:10,982 --> 01:46:12,042
LAURA: Okay.

1800
01:46:12,042 --> 01:46:15,175
MATT: It's now Beau's go.

1801
01:46:15,175 --> 01:46:17,536
MARISHA: Okay. Is it dark in here?

1802
01:46:17,536 --> 01:46:21,083
MATT: It is dark. You currently, there's a little
bit of light that you have--

1803
01:46:21,083 --> 01:46:23,401
LIAM: The closest globule is ten feet behind us.

1804
01:46:23,401 --> 01:46:27,138
MATT: Yeah, you're seeing action happen up ahead,
and you're like (groan). You don't have a good

1805
01:46:27,138 --> 01:46:29,984
bead. You can still do things, but you're considered
blind, so you have disadvantage on any

1806
01:46:29,984 --> 01:46:31,400
attacks that you make.

1807
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:38,493
MARISHA: Can I run up to the guy that just came up
to Jester and wait until that light comes up from Caleb?

1808
01:46:38,497 --> 01:46:41,075
MATT: Yeah, you can hold your action if you want.

1809
01:46:41,075 --> 01:46:42,371
MARISHA: Hold the attack?

1810
01:46:42,371 --> 01:46:45,623
MATT: Okay. All right, you're holding your action.
You rush up and you can see the outer glimmers of

1811
01:46:45,623 --> 01:46:48,573
bits of bone and its body moving as it rushes in
to harry Jester.

1812
01:46:48,573 --> 01:46:51,725
MARISHA: When I hold my action, can I also hold my
bonus action with that?

1813
01:46:51,725 --> 01:46:53,211
MATT: No. Only your action, unfortunately.

1814
01:46:53,211 --> 01:46:58,325
MARISHA: Can I use my bonus action to spend a ki
point and do patient defense?

1815
01:46:58,325 --> 01:46:59,598
MATT: You can.

1816
01:46:59,598 --> 01:47:00,641
MARISHA: Let's do that.

1817
01:47:00,641 --> 01:47:02,521
MATT: You go into a defensive potion there, all
right.

1818
01:47:02,521 --> 01:47:04,774
MARISHA: I can still attack when it comes, right?

1819
01:47:04,774 --> 01:47:05,907
MATT: Correct.

1820
01:47:05,907 --> 01:47:07,466
MARISHA: Okay. Thank you.

1821
01:47:07,466 --> 01:47:08,384
MATT: That ends your turn. Caleb, you're up.

1822
01:47:08,384 --> 01:47:14,729
LIAM: My choo-choo train of globules of light go
(whirring) and float over all our heads--

1823
01:47:14,729 --> 01:47:16,905
MATT: Lighting up the vicinity here.

1824
01:47:16,905 --> 01:47:21,945
LIAM: Yeah. I'm already falling into a routine
with my other human friend here, because I know

1825
01:47:21,945 --> 01:47:27,444
that she's a badass, but not without light. The
globules pass her and curve to the left a little

1826
01:47:27,444 --> 01:47:30,497
bit, and one floats above her head. The last one.

1827
01:47:30,497 --> 01:47:31,746
MATT: Okay. Perfect.

1828
01:47:31,746 --> 01:47:37,266
MARISHA: As soon as it comes around me, I'm going
to use the staff with the light as it comes and

1829
01:47:37,266 --> 01:47:39,246
crack it down over top of his head.

1830
01:47:39,246 --> 01:47:41,049
MATT: Go for it.

1831
01:47:41,049 --> 01:47:51,629
MARISHA: Natural 20! I rolled an eight on my die!
(sings) Max all the way around. That's 16 plus

1832
01:47:51,629 --> 01:47:54,489
four! I'm not going to touch you right now. I'm
sick.

1833
01:47:54,489 --> 01:47:57,777
There we go. I'll hit the elbow. 20!

1834
01:47:57,777 --> 01:48:02,887
MATT: All right, so as the light emerges above,
you leap into the air, swing the staff, bring it

1835
01:48:02,887 --> 01:48:04,340
straight down, as it does--

1836
01:48:04,340 --> 01:48:06,603
MARISHA: Can I have the light following behind me
as I run up?

1837
01:48:06,603 --> 01:48:10,222
MATT: Yeah. It splinters the skeleton into pieces
all around its entire body, crushes and collapses

1838
01:48:10,222 --> 01:48:12,104
to the ground. Scattered across.

1839
01:48:12,104 --> 01:48:13,549
MARISHA: Fuck yeah.

1840
01:48:13,549 --> 01:48:16,163
KHARY: Anastasia, did you just see that?

1841
01:48:16,163 --> 01:48:18,155
(laughter)

1842
01:48:18,155 --> 01:48:20,673
MATT: Caleb, rest of your turn?

1843
01:48:20,673 --> 01:48:23,449
LIAM: That was it. No, I'm staying where the hell
I am.

1844
01:48:23,449 --> 01:48:26,750
MATT: Stay where you are, all right. That finishes
your go. The light is in the room. The end of

1845
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:28,149
Caleb's turn, that is now Fjord.

1846
01:48:28,149 --> 01:48:32,082
LIAM: Ah! I'll move up 15 feet. Sorry, I
apologize, <i>Entschuldigung</i>.

1847
01:48:32,082 --> 01:48:34,258
MATT: 15. There you go.

1848
01:48:34,258 --> 01:48:36,693
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll come up the stairs so I can get
a line of sight on any of those motherfucks.

1849
01:48:39,693 --> 01:48:41,042
MATT: There, 30?

1850
01:48:41,042 --> 01:48:43,151
TRAVIS: Actually, I'll be behind Beau.

1851
01:48:43,151 --> 01:48:45,591
MATT: Okay. Behind Beau right there.

1852
01:48:45,694 --> 01:48:48,539
MARISHA: I hug the wall, let Fjord do his thing.

1853
01:48:48,539 --> 01:48:50,578
MATT: I'll put you right there. We'll just lean
you.

1854
01:48:50,578 --> 01:48:51,708
TRAVIS: Coming through!

1855
01:48:51,708 --> 01:48:53,446
MATT: There. Oh, excuse me!

1856
01:48:53,446 --> 01:48:54,877
TRAVIS: Eldritch Blast.

1857
01:48:54,889 --> 01:48:57,355
MATT: Which one are you shooting at?

1858
01:48:57,355 --> 01:48:59,227
TRAVIS: The closest one.

1859
01:48:59,227 --> 01:49:01,604
MATT: That's the one that's been frosted. Go for
it.

1860
01:49:01,604 --> 01:49:02,767
TRAVIS: Only 14.

1861
01:49:02,767 --> 01:49:05,633
MATT: 14, for against him, does not hit.

1862
01:49:05,633 --> 01:49:06,441
TRAVIS: Yep.

1863
01:49:06,441 --> 01:49:11,821
MATT: Unfortunately. It manages to strike some
sort of shield on the side that shatters. It's

1864
01:49:11,821 --> 01:49:16,541
bolted to its forearm. It pulls it up just in time
to deflect the Eldritch Blast. It cracks the

1865
01:49:16,541 --> 01:49:19,466
shield and does damage to its exterior, but no
wound to the actual gnoll.

1866
01:49:19,466 --> 01:49:21,381
TRAVIS: Fair enough. That's my turn.

1867
01:49:21,381 --> 01:49:27,087
MATT: That finishes Fjord. Top of the round, you
hear this (hyena barking and growling).

1868
01:49:27,087 --> 01:49:29,551
MARISHA and LAURA: Oh shit.

1869
01:49:29,551 --> 01:49:30,613
MATT: (heavy footfalls)

1870
01:49:30,613 --> 01:49:33,725
LAURA: Oh no, it's the general!

1871
01:49:33,725 --> 01:49:34,678
MATT: Watch as an armored gnoll--

1872
01:49:34,678 --> 01:49:36,749
ALL: Here comes the general!

1873
01:49:36,749 --> 01:49:38,703
MATT: In the back of the chamber.

1874
01:49:38,703 --> 01:49:41,123
LIAM: Gnoll Washington!

1875
01:49:41,123 --> 01:49:42,172
(laughter)

1876
01:49:42,172 --> 01:49:44,386
LAURA: We are outgunned.

1877
01:49:44,386 --> 01:49:45,416
ALL: What!

1878
01:49:45,416 --> 01:49:46,518
LAURA an KHARY: Outmanned!

1879
01:49:46,518 --> 01:49:47,749
ALL: What!

1880
01:49:47,749 --> 01:49:58,760
MATT: Outnumbered, and crossbow. As the pack lord
approaches, cackling at the sight of you, you see

1881
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:06,904
a look of recognition on its eyes as it pulls back
its longbow and is going to go ahead and fire

1882
01:50:06,904 --> 01:50:12,598
immediately at-- Well, first I'm going to see-- It
does see through the illusion, so it does not fire

1883
01:50:12,598 --> 01:50:16,261
for the fake Jester; however, it does fire for
you, the actual Jester.

1884
01:50:16,261 --> 01:50:17,913
TALIESIN: I'm going to use Blood Maledict.

1885
01:50:17,913 --> 01:50:19,881
MATT: You currently do not have visual.

1886
01:50:19,881 --> 01:50:20,763
TALIESIN: I do not have visual?

1887
01:50:20,763 --> 01:50:22,985
MATT: Not in your current position, nope.

1888
01:50:22,985 --> 01:50:23,805
TALIESIN: Damn it. Fine.

1889
01:50:23,805 --> 01:50:30,649
MATT: So that's an attack on you with a longbow.
That is going to be a 15.

1890
01:50:30,649 --> 01:50:31,825
LAURA: Doesn't hit me!

1891
01:50:31,825 --> 01:50:33,679
MATT: Doesn't hit you.

1892
01:50:33,679 --> 01:50:35,310
LAURA: 17! I put my shield up.

1893
01:50:35,310 --> 01:50:41,345
MATT: It splinters across the shield, no impact.
That's going to end its go. We're now at the top

1894
01:50:41,345 --> 01:50:42,649
of the round. It's your turn, Shakäste.

1895
01:50:44,471 --> 01:50:48,471
SAM and MARISHA: (whisper) Shakäste.

1896
01:50:48,493 --> 01:50:49,503
KHARY: Aid.

1897
01:50:49,503 --> 01:50:50,929
MARISHA: A rakshasa.

1898
01:50:51,023 --> 01:50:55,861
KHARY: I don't know, this big guy's got me
worried. This may take a little time. Nobody seems

1899
01:50:55,861 --> 01:50:57,399
to be able to hit shit right now.

1900
01:50:58,449 --> 01:51:00,188
TALIESIN: Welcome to the game!

1901
01:51:00,188 --> 01:51:12,962
KHARY: Yeah, so I say myself and my two brave
warriors who are so far frontal, Mrs. and Mrs.?

1902
01:51:12,962 --> 01:51:14,324
MARISHA: Yeah.

1903
01:51:14,324 --> 01:51:16,953
KHARY: Let's all take Aid. I will, and so will
they.

1904
01:51:16,953 --> 01:51:18,385
MATT: All righty.

1905
01:51:18,385 --> 01:51:19,624
LAURA: What is Aid?

1906
01:51:19,624 --> 01:51:21,615
MATT: Aid, is that 2nd-level?

1907
01:51:21,615 --> 01:51:23,034
KHARY: Aid is 2nd-level, yeah.

1908
01:51:23,034 --> 01:51:28,295
MATT: I believe you both get five additional hit
points to your max, and five hit points.

1909
01:51:28,295 --> 01:51:29,293
LAURA: Me?

1910
01:51:29,293 --> 01:51:32,293
MATT: Yeah, so the three of you, your max hit
points go up by five.

1911
01:51:32,293 --> 01:51:33,350
LIAM: Oh, nice.

1912
01:51:33,350 --> 01:51:35,126
MATT: You gain five hit points on top of that.

1913
01:51:35,126 --> 01:51:36,172
TRAVIS: Damn.

1914
01:51:36,172 --> 01:51:39,840
MARISHA: I turn to Shakäste and I say: Are you a
motivational speaker or something?

1915
01:51:41,540 --> 01:51:44,162
KHARY: I pack them in on the Menagerie Coast,
baby.

1916
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:47,873
TRAVIS: He knew the location!

1917
01:51:47,873 --> 01:51:49,117
MARISHA: He totally did.

1918
01:51:49,117 --> 01:51:53,152
TRAVIS: He fucking studied up!

1919
01:51:53,152 --> 01:51:56,403
LAURA: There, it's already at 30, so 31?? Sweet.

1920
01:51:56,403 --> 01:52:03,733
MATT: All right, as you feel this sudden burst of
physical hardiness surge within, this warm glow in

1921
01:52:03,733 --> 01:52:09,213
your belly that helps stir you up to the future of
physical impact and damage. That's your action; do

1922
01:52:09,213 --> 01:52:10,646
you want to move at all on your turn?

1923
01:52:10,646 --> 01:52:22,635
KHARY: Sure. You know what? I think I'll move up a
few feet, and I'll also take Anastasia and put her

1924
01:52:22,635 --> 01:52:27,727
a little further forward, but at a safe distance
from these people.

1925
01:52:27,727 --> 01:52:30,844
MATT: All right. Like this direction, or this
direction?

1926
01:52:30,844 --> 01:52:35,244
KHARY: Actually, yeah, closer to me. Yeah, there
we go.

1927
01:52:35,244 --> 01:52:38,062
MATT: We'll put Anastasia perching on the wall
there, looking that way.

1928
01:52:38,062 --> 01:52:39,119
KHARY: I like it.

1929
01:52:39,119 --> 01:52:47,135
MATT: Okay. That ends your turn. It's now the
gnolls' go. This one is going to rush forward

1930
01:52:47,135 --> 01:52:52,427
towards you. This skeletal one is going to rush
forward towards Jester. This one's going to stay

1931
01:52:52,427 --> 01:52:58,615
back and continue to fire at Beau. It's going to
take a step back there. This one's going to stay

1932
01:52:58,615 --> 01:53:04,968
where it is and take a shot at Beau as well. We
have one gnoll that's attacking you with a spear.

1933
01:53:06,478 --> 01:53:08,766
That's a 12.

1934
01:53:08,766 --> 01:53:09,858
LAURA: Yeah!

1935
01:53:09,858 --> 01:53:14,446
MATT: You deflect it with your sickle, which
you've unhooked from earlier. Just grab it and

1936
01:53:14,446 --> 01:53:19,344
(shing) off to the side, parrying it. The skeletal
witherling rushes up and is going to attempt to

1937
01:53:19,344 --> 01:53:24,473
strike at you with a bite actually. It's going to
lash out with its horrible bony maw. That is

1938
01:53:24,473 --> 01:53:27,027
going to be a ten.

1939
01:53:27,027 --> 01:53:28,245
LAURA: Ha.

1940
01:53:28,245 --> 01:53:31,528
MATT: You pull the shield up a little higher.
Teeth shatter and break and fly off around the

1941
01:53:31,528 --> 01:53:33,082
exterior of the shield.

1942
01:53:33,082 --> 01:53:34,813
LAURA: I look over at Beau and I'm like: I'm doing
you!

1943
01:53:34,813 --> 01:53:35,982
MARISHA: Good job!

1944
01:53:35,982 --> 01:53:40,699
MATT: As you're doing that, "Good job!", you look
back just as two arrows go flying towards you from

1945
01:53:40,699 --> 01:53:43,849
the two other gnolls. They both have disadvantage,
I believe, right? Because you took your defensive stance.

1946
01:53:43,849 --> 01:53:44,886
MARISHA: Yep.

1947
01:53:44,886 --> 01:53:48,908
MATT: All right, which is good because that
would've been a 20, and an 11.

1948
01:53:48,908 --> 01:53:49,863
MARISHA: Miss, miss.

1949
01:53:49,863 --> 01:53:56,116
MATT: Well, that's the first attack. I rolled a 20
and 11. You dodge out of the way. The second one

1950
01:53:56,116 --> 01:54:02,198
is going to be a 21 and a 22.

1951
01:54:02,497 --> 01:54:04,973
MATT: That hits.

1952
01:54:04,973 --> 01:54:06,297
MARISHA: See if I can catch another arrow.

1953
01:54:06,297 --> 01:54:09,398
MATT: You take six points of piercing damage.

1954
01:54:09,398 --> 01:54:11,531
MARISHA: I'm going to do my Deflect Missile.

1955
01:54:11,531 --> 01:54:12,573
MATT: Reaction, right.

1956
01:54:12,573 --> 01:54:16,550
MARISHA: I'm going to try and do like a frisbee
catch in the air.

1957
01:54:16,550 --> 01:54:18,098
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll your die.

1958
01:54:18,098 --> 01:54:23,468
MARISHA: It's a d10, right, d10? What was it, six
damage?

1959
01:54:23,468 --> 01:54:25,479
MATT: Six piercing damage.

1960
01:54:25,479 --> 01:54:26,606
MARISHA: Five plus my seven, so yes.

1961
01:54:26,606 --> 01:54:29,721
MATT: All right, so the first arrow you dodge out
of the way, and the second one you see it coming

1962
01:54:29,721 --> 01:54:34,019
out of the way. There's a brief moment where time
seems to (whirring) and you catch it right in the

1963
01:54:34,019 --> 01:54:37,611
middle of your hand. It pulls you back a little
bit and looking down you can see the arrow is

1964
01:54:37,611 --> 01:54:39,037
there, right in the middle of your grip.

1965
01:54:39,037 --> 01:54:43,285
MARISHA: (stuttering) We're so cool right now!
Yeah!

1966
01:54:43,285 --> 01:54:44,886
KHARY: You're welcome.

1967
01:54:44,886 --> 01:54:51,413
(laughter)

1968
01:54:51,413 --> 01:54:54,173
MATT: That's going to end the gnolls' go. Molly,
you're up.

1969
01:54:54,173 --> 01:54:58,640
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to try and run up
the stairs toward the undead guy.

1970
01:54:58,640 --> 01:54:59,531
MATT: There you go.

1971
01:54:59,531 --> 01:55:06,470
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a swing at him. That's
14 to hit?

1972
01:55:06,470 --> 01:55:08,025
MATT: 14 hits him.

1973
01:55:08,025 --> 01:55:08,740
TALIESIN: Okay.

1974
01:55:08,740 --> 01:55:10,033
MATT: Only a 12 armor class.

1975
01:55:10,033 --> 01:55:20,247
TALIESIN: Wow. Let's see what we do. That's
(counting) 11 points of damage?

1976
01:55:20,247 --> 01:55:26,229
MATT: 11 points of damage is just what you needed.
With your first strike, infused with the rite, you

1977
01:55:26,229 --> 01:55:31,133
streak down with your first blow and your scimitar
carves through the upper part of its shoulder

1978
01:55:31,133 --> 01:55:34,616
blade into its ribcage. As you do, you watch as
whatever necrotic energy's holding its body

1979
01:55:34,616 --> 01:55:38,153
together suddenly dissipates and all the bones
clatter to the ground in a pile.

1980
01:55:38,153 --> 01:55:40,997
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep running and to get to
the other side of that other gnoll.

1981
01:55:40,997 --> 01:55:42,535
MATT: This one here?

1982
01:55:42,535 --> 01:55:45,898
TALIESIN: Yeah. Actually, if there's any way, can
I get all the way around him?

1983
01:55:45,898 --> 01:55:50,296
MATT: (counting) Yes, there is.

1984
01:55:50,296 --> 01:55:59,188
TALIESIN: Yeah! I don't know if this is helpful,
but I'm going to take my second swing. That's 18

1985
01:55:59,188 --> 01:55:59,734
to hit.

1986
01:55:59,734 --> 01:56:01,473
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

1987
01:56:01,574 --> 01:56:06,009
MATT: You don't get the bonus to your wisdom, but
you still have the rite on that one.

1988
01:56:06,009 --> 01:56:07,518
TALIESIN: That's ten points of damage.

1989
01:56:07,518 --> 01:56:09,749
MATT: Ten points of damage on the other.

1990
01:56:09,749 --> 01:56:11,483
LIAM: Regular gnoll.

1991
01:56:12,523 --> 01:56:16,128
MATT: Using the momentum of that first strike, you
continue running and with a backwards swipe carve

1992
01:56:16,128 --> 01:56:20,905
through the back of the other gnoll. It arches its
back with pain as you carve this giant wound

1993
01:56:20,905 --> 01:56:25,204
across the back of its shoulder to about where the
base of its spine is, and you see blood beginning

1994
01:56:25,204 --> 01:56:29,278
to flow from its wound where the bits of the armor
are separated, and the fur poking out from within

1995
01:56:29,278 --> 01:56:32,223
the haphazard hide. I believe that ends your
turn?

1996
01:56:32,223 --> 01:56:33,444
TALIESIN: That ends my turn.

1997
01:56:33,444 --> 01:56:35,486
MATT: All righty. End of Molly's turn. Nott,
you're up.

1998
01:56:35,486 --> 01:56:39,259
SAM: (whimpers) That's my turn.

1999
01:56:39,259 --> 01:56:43,751
(laughter)

2000
01:56:43,751 --> 01:56:55,991
SAM: No, I will run up behind Shakäste and I'll
peek around and fire at the frosty one right in

2001
01:56:55,991 --> 01:56:57,228
front of Jester.

2002
01:56:57,228 --> 01:56:59,256
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

2003
01:56:59,256 --> 01:57:00,526
LAURA: (whispers) Frosty.

2004
01:57:00,526 --> 01:57:02,519
SAM: Yeah, 24.

2005
01:57:02,519 --> 01:57:05,187
MATT: 24 hits, and you do get sneak attack because
it is currently--

2006
01:57:05,187 --> 01:57:06,052
SAM: Yeah!

2007
01:57:06,052 --> 01:57:07,410
LAURA: Engaged!

2008
01:57:07,410 --> 01:57:08,478
TALIESIN: So engaged.

2009
01:57:08,478 --> 01:57:10,032
LIAM: (Picard voice) Engage.

2010
01:57:10,032 --> 01:57:11,105
SAM: 12.

2011
01:57:11,105 --> 01:57:13,623
MATT: 12 points of damage. It's already taken 11
from the rest of you, so that finishes it off.

2012
01:57:13,623 --> 01:57:15,422
(cheering)

2013
01:57:15,422 --> 01:57:20,679
MATT: You wait for the moment where Jester moves
out of the way. As it's pulling back and beginning

2014
01:57:20,679 --> 01:57:24,557
to try and strike again with its spear, and take
the shot and watch as it hits right in the sternum

2015
01:57:24,557 --> 01:57:31,806
and pulls back its spear and with its final thrust
of momentum, falls to the ground into a pile and

2016
01:57:31,806 --> 01:57:35,384
is now bleeding out of its mouth as it's
unconscious and dying on the ground.

2017
01:57:35,384 --> 01:57:37,259
LAURA: I'm a really good fighter you guys!

2018
01:57:37,259 --> 01:57:49,049
SAM: Bonus action, I will cast Mage Hand and pull
back the cloak around Shakäste's cloak, to see

2019
01:57:49,049 --> 01:57:50,954
what's in his back pocket.

2020
01:57:50,954 --> 01:57:54,440
MATT: Can you cast it as a bonus action?

2021
01:57:54,440 --> 01:57:56,586
SAM: You can <i>use</i> it as a bonus action.

2022
01:57:56,756 --> 01:57:58,865
MATT: Meaning you cast it as an action. You can't
do that yet.

2023
01:57:58,865 --> 01:58:01,192
SAM: Then I will do this with my hand.

2024
01:58:01,192 --> 01:58:07,083
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check. I need you to
go ahead and make a perception check.

2025
01:58:07,083 --> 01:58:08,310
KHARY: Ah, yes.

2026
01:58:08,310 --> 01:58:10,161
SAM: 22.

2027
01:58:10,161 --> 01:58:12,323
MATT: Roll a d20. Add your perception skill
modifier.

2028
01:58:12,323 --> 01:58:13,993
TRAVIS: Come on, 20.

2029
01:58:13,993 --> 01:58:15,126
LIAM and KHARY: No.

2030
01:58:15,126 --> 01:58:17,469
MATT: Yeah, you don't notice it.

2031
01:58:17,472 --> 01:58:20,283
What does he see hanging off the back of
your belt?

2032
01:58:20,283 --> 01:58:22,833
SAM: Anything off the belt, in the back pocket?

2033
01:58:22,833 --> 01:58:25,342
KHARY: Oh, gosh, what do I have back there?

2034
01:58:25,342 --> 01:58:28,388
TRAVIS: What don't you have back there?

2035
01:58:28,388 --> 01:58:30,542
KHARY: Yeah, what don't I have back there?

2036
01:58:30,542 --> 01:58:32,230
SAM: It's assless chaps!

2037
01:58:32,480 --> 01:58:35,480
(laughter)

2038
01:58:35,480 --> 01:58:39,575
KHARY: He sees a pouch that's relatively full, I
would say.

2039
01:58:39,575 --> 01:58:42,400
MATT: Okay. Just hanging right there on the back
of the belt.

2040
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:45,768
SAM: Okay. Good to know. That's my action; that's
my bonus action.

2041
01:58:45,768 --> 01:58:48,298
MATT: That's your action. That finishes your turn,
Nott. Jester, you're up.

2042
01:58:48,298 --> 01:58:56,025
LAURA: Okay. That went really well, so I'm going
to run-- Oh, god, there's three of them right there.

2043
01:58:56,025 --> 01:58:57,557
TRAVIS: They're going to spread pretty soon.

2044
01:58:57,557 --> 01:58:58,686
LAURA: I know, but--

2045
01:58:58,686 --> 01:58:59,718
TRAVIS: Right after you.

2046
01:58:59,718 --> 01:59:07,068
LAURA: What am I going to do? I'm going to run
into-- Oh, no, that's really dumb. I'm going to

2047
01:59:07,068 --> 01:59:12,013
use my duplicate and she's going to Toll the
Dead.

2048
01:59:12,013 --> 01:59:14,423
MATT: To which one?

2049
01:59:14,423 --> 01:59:16,311
LAURA: To the orange one.

2050
01:59:16,311 --> 01:59:18,612
TRAVIS and LAURA: Come on, Toll the Dead!

2051
01:59:18,612 --> 01:59:19,737
TRAVIS: One time!

2052
01:59:19,737 --> 01:59:21,547
LAURA: It's a wisdom saving throw!

2053
01:59:21,547 --> 01:59:23,439
LIAM: Toll house.

2054
01:59:23,439 --> 01:59:24,355
TRAVIS and LAURA: Roll low!

2055
01:59:24,355 --> 01:59:25,928
MATT: It did! It rolled a seven.

2056
01:59:25,928 --> 01:59:27,571
(cheering)

2057
01:59:27,571 --> 01:59:32,331
LAURA: This is a really loud gong. He takes four
damage.

2058
01:59:32,331 --> 01:59:36,404
MATT: Four points of damage. All right. That was
to which one of these two?

2059
01:59:36,404 --> 01:59:37,683
LAURA: The orange one.

2060
01:59:37,683 --> 01:59:40,216
MATT: The orange one, okay. Both of them have been
damaged now, a little bit. You watch as it shakes

2061
01:59:40,216 --> 01:59:44,722
its head for a second, and it's beginning to
string another arrow. That finishes your turn?

2062
01:59:44,722 --> 01:59:46,609
LAURA: Oh, had he not been damaged yet?

2063
01:59:46,609 --> 01:59:47,879
MATT: He had not been damaged before.

2064
01:59:47,879 --> 01:59:50,564
LAURA: I shouldn't have rolled a 12. I should have
rolled an eight.

2065
01:59:50,564 --> 01:59:52,136
MATT: Then roll that eight.

2066
01:59:52,136 --> 01:59:54,221
LAURA: Six damage.

2067
01:59:54,221 --> 01:59:55,845
MATT: Weirdly, more damage.

2068
01:59:55,845 --> 01:59:56,595
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2069
01:59:56,595 --> 02:00:02,458
MATT: Well, there you go. Now he's damaged. Good
catch on that. That end your turn or do you want

2070
02:00:02,458 --> 02:00:05,516
to move? Well you moved your-- oh, that was a
bonus action.

2071
02:00:05,516 --> 02:00:09,950
LAURA: As a bonus action I did that, so I'm going
hop up on the table that I'm next to.

2072
02:00:09,950 --> 02:00:12,743
MATT: All righty.

2073
02:00:12,743 --> 02:00:13,810
LAURA: Yeah.

2074
02:00:13,810 --> 02:00:18,604
MATT: That's your turn. That brings us to-- all,
no, both of the skeletons have been destroyed.

2075
02:00:18,604 --> 02:00:22,216
That'll bring us to Beau's turn.

2076
02:00:22,216 --> 02:00:28,049
MARISHA: All right. I'm going to vault past
everybody. Well, never mind they all moved. I'm

2077
02:00:28,049 --> 02:00:31,111
going to run up right into fray.

2078
02:00:34,471 --> 02:00:36,914
MATT: Five, ten, 15, which one?

2079
02:00:36,914 --> 02:00:39,832
MARISHA: Right in between the orange guy and the
gray guy.

2080
02:00:39,832 --> 02:00:41,297
MATT: There you go.

2081
02:00:43,517 --> 02:00:46,358
MARISHA: Hit, and then I'll probably do my Flurry
of Blows.

2082
02:00:46,358 --> 02:00:48,079
MATT: Go for it.

2083
02:00:48,079 --> 02:00:57,607
MARISHA: I'm going to run up, I'm going to go for
a rib shot with the bo. It's not a good roll. It's

2084
02:00:57,607 --> 02:00:59,222
not great. 12.

2085
02:00:59,222 --> 02:01:04,934
MATT: 12 does not hit. As you rush forward to
swing with your first strike, the one that'd been

2086
02:01:04,934 --> 02:01:09,561
firing at you from the previous round notices your
approach, throws the longbow over the arm and

2087
02:01:09,561 --> 02:01:13,610
brings up the shield in the same motion and
deflects the quick thrust of your staff.

2088
02:01:13,610 --> 02:01:17,781
MARISHA: Uh-huh. Okay.

2089
02:01:17,781 --> 02:01:20,043
MATT: If you're doing Flurry of Blows you have two
more attacks on it.

2090
02:01:20,043 --> 02:01:25,004
MARISHA: Yeah, wonder if that's a good idea. Maybe
I should-- I'm going to Patient Defense this

2091
02:01:25,004 --> 02:01:28,822
again. Do I have a bonus attack?

2092
02:01:28,822 --> 02:01:32,496
MATT: No, you do that instead of your bonus
attack. You hit once, it gets deflected, and you

2093
02:01:32,496 --> 02:01:34,841
spend your bonus action to do Patient Defense.

2094
02:01:34,841 --> 02:01:36,810
MARISHA: That didn't go as well as I thought.

2095
02:01:36,810 --> 02:01:38,186
MATT: That's all right.

2096
02:01:38,186 --> 02:01:40,018
TALIESIN: That's okay. You've engaged them, which
means they're less likely to use their bows.

2097
02:01:40,018 --> 02:01:41,300
MARISHA: That's true.

2098
02:01:41,300 --> 02:01:43,086
MATT: That ends your turn. Caleb, you're up.

2099
02:01:43,086 --> 02:01:46,321
LIAM: I don't really have a clear view of what's
going on so I would, on this wall here, I would

2100
02:01:46,321 --> 02:01:49,839
inch five or ten feet up the cave to see what's
going on.

2101
02:01:49,839 --> 02:01:51,379
MATT: You get just about there.

2102
02:01:51,379 --> 02:01:54,348
LIAM: I see a gigantic gnoll and-- okay.

2103
02:01:54,348 --> 02:01:56,844
MATT: The one that you saw earlier in Alfield and
that you--

2104
02:01:56,844 --> 02:01:57,934
LIAM: The big one.

2105
02:01:57,934 --> 02:02:02,061
I'm going to do what I did to him before and
I'm going to bring my hand once around, twice

2106
02:02:02,061 --> 02:02:10,029
around, three times around and cast Scorching Ray
on that one only. First is a 17.

2107
02:02:10,029 --> 02:02:11,656
MARISHA: Come on, Caleb!

2108
02:02:11,656 --> 02:02:13,425
MATT: 17 hits.

2109
02:02:13,425 --> 02:02:14,872
LAURA and MARISHA: (cheering)

2110
02:02:14,872 --> 02:02:17,154
LIAM: Second one hits as well, and the third one
also hits.

2111
02:02:17,154 --> 02:02:18,523
(cheering)

2112
02:02:18,523 --> 02:02:20,183
TALIESIN: Take that.

2113
02:02:20,183 --> 02:02:22,251
SAM: Those are the only hits he's had all
campaign.

2114
02:02:22,251 --> 02:02:24,515
MARISHA: Guys, I think Shakäste makes us better
people.

2115
02:02:24,515 --> 02:02:26,412
LAURA: Shakäste, stay forever.

2116
02:02:26,412 --> 02:02:27,429
MARISHA: He makes us better.

2117
02:02:27,429 --> 02:02:30,959
LIAM: 18. That is a total of 20 of fire damage.

2118
02:02:30,959 --> 02:02:32,328
MATT: 20 points of fire damage.

2119
02:02:32,328 --> 02:02:33,908
(cheering)

2120
02:02:33,908 --> 02:02:38,097
MATT: That's awesome. As he turns the corner, the
two gnolls back out of the way and you see it

2121
02:02:38,097 --> 02:02:42,303
standing there. It has its large two-handed glaive
in its hand, its shield slung over one shoulder,

2122
02:02:42,303 --> 02:02:47,111
the bow over the other, and seeing this for the
first time, you see this larger, muscular, more

2123
02:02:47,111 --> 02:02:54,428
dark-furred gnoll that looks like the leader of
this cluster, this pack. The armor it has is

2124
02:02:54,428 --> 02:03:02,349
chunks of chainmail and hide armor that are
patched together where a number of long, thin

2125
02:03:02,349 --> 02:03:10,312
spines, like heavy, bone-like spikes have been
woven into it like a decoration to make it look

2126
02:03:10,312 --> 02:03:17,347
extremely intimidating. Right as it grins and gets
its glaive ready, it gets blasted with three beams

2127
02:03:17,347 --> 02:03:22,974
of burning arcane energy as they hit and impact
you watch as the flames curl up and it has to pat

2128
02:03:22,974 --> 02:03:29,452
it out with its giant hand. (snarling) It took the
hit like a champ, and it seems like it's hurt, but

2129
02:03:29,452 --> 02:03:31,299
it's still doing pretty well.

2130
02:03:31,299 --> 02:03:34,564
LIAM: I wipe my arm down and say: Oh boy.

2131
02:03:36,114 --> 02:03:37,768
MATT: Is that your turn?

2132
02:03:37,768 --> 02:03:38,984
LIAM: Yeah, that's done.

2133
02:03:38,984 --> 02:03:42,161
MATT: That was a good round. That finishes Caleb's
turn. Fjord, you're up.

2134
02:03:42,161 --> 02:03:45,162
TRAVIS: I pick myself up out of my prone position
there on the--

2135
02:03:45,162 --> 02:03:46,836
MATT: Well technically you're not prone, sorry.

2136
02:03:46,836 --> 02:03:49,386
TRAVIS: I know, I was commenting on the way I was
laying. Can I come up to the top of the stairs,

2137
02:03:49,386 --> 02:03:57,429
right there? Keeping some of my movement left, and
can I cast Eldritch Blast, at the gnoll that's

2138
02:03:57,429 --> 02:03:59,979
standing in front of the big bad baby?

2139
02:03:59,979 --> 02:04:03,528
MATT: Right there? You may. Go ahead and roll the
attack.

2140
02:04:03,528 --> 02:04:04,483
TRAVIS: 17.

2141
02:04:04,483 --> 02:04:05,494
MATT: That hits, roll damage.

2142
02:04:05,494 --> 02:04:06,918
TRAVIS: Nice. That plus six, that's eight points.

2143
02:04:06,918 --> 02:04:13,191
MATT: Eight points of damage. That one, as it's
notching another arrow into its bow it takes the

2144
02:04:13,191 --> 02:04:15,784
impact off of its shoulder. It grazed it.

2145
02:04:15,784 --> 02:04:24,684
TRAVIS: With my bonus action, can I cast
Hexblade's Curse on the big motherfucker and say:

2146
02:04:24,684 --> 02:04:27,290
Come on, you sack of shit, come get me.

2147
02:04:27,290 --> 02:04:34,317
MATT: You may. We'll mark him with the Hexblade
Curse with this big old angry black circle to mark

2148
02:04:34,317 --> 02:04:36,370
him as the target there.

2149
02:04:36,380 --> 02:04:38,930
TRAVIS: Can I use the rest of my movement to go
back down the stairs?

2150
02:04:38,930 --> 02:04:40,486
MATT: You may.

2151
02:04:40,486 --> 02:04:43,107
LAURA: Come get me, you coward!

2152
02:04:43,107 --> 02:04:49,904
MATT: That ends Fjord's turn. Back of the combat
round, it's now the pack lord's turn. The pack

2153
02:04:49,904 --> 02:04:52,959
lord returns to this way--

2154
02:04:52,959 --> 02:04:54,530
TALIESIN: Attack of opportunity-- oh, no.

2155
02:04:54,530 --> 02:05:02,192
MATT: No, it steps through the one and is going to
turn this way, and rear back for a giant kick.

2156
02:05:02,192 --> 02:05:05,390
It's going to make a shove attack against you.

2157
02:05:05,390 --> 02:05:06,798
TRAVIS: That's not a pit, is it?

2158
02:05:06,798 --> 02:05:08,587
MATT: Yeah, that's a big ol' pit.

2159
02:05:08,587 --> 02:05:10,083
TRAVIS: I thought they were stairs!

2160
02:05:10,083 --> 02:05:11,863
MARISHA: But we couldn't see that!

2161
02:05:11,863 --> 02:05:13,570
SAM: It's another poo hole.

2162
02:05:13,570 --> 02:05:15,747
LIAM: I had no idea that was there!

2163
02:05:15,747 --> 02:05:19,528
TALIESIN: Blood Maledict to all fuck.

2164
02:05:19,528 --> 02:05:22,128
MATT: He already has disadvantage because of
Patient Defense.

2165
02:05:22,128 --> 02:05:24,555
LIAM: We can imagine that, Matt. We needed the
fear of god.

2166
02:05:24,555 --> 02:05:25,805
TALIESIN: Oh, look at that.

2167
02:05:25,805 --> 02:05:32,580
MARISHA: (groaning) Well. I'm suddenly having
regrets.

2168
02:05:32,580 --> 02:05:35,595
MATT: One and 17. What's your armor class?

2169
02:05:35,595 --> 02:05:36,556
MARISHA: 17.

2170
02:05:36,556 --> 02:05:38,718
MATT: Oh, shit! All right, so, hold on.

2171
02:05:38,718 --> 02:05:40,439
SAM: Does that hit or not?

2172
02:05:40,439 --> 02:05:43,517
MATT: It hits. We'll see with the shove.

2173
02:05:43,517 --> 02:05:48,116
TRAVIS: I think it's five feet unless it's
stronger. Could be ten.

2174
02:05:48,116 --> 02:05:51,925
MATT: I'm seeing if there's a contested check, we
haven't done the shove in a while here.

2175
02:05:51,925 --> 02:05:57,062
LIAM: Yeah, that back wall perfectly blocks that
whole thing.

2176
02:05:57,062 --> 02:05:59,260
MATT: I'm so sorry, guys. That's my bad.

2177
02:05:59,260 --> 02:06:00,827
MARISHA: Totally probably wouldn't have even have
run up.

2178
02:06:00,827 --> 02:06:03,047
MATT: That's my bad.

2179
02:06:03,250 --> 02:06:06,116
LAURA: It's fine. You're just going to die.

2180
02:06:06,116 --> 02:06:07,618
MARISHA: It'll be great.

2181
02:06:07,618 --> 02:06:11,088
SAM: You've got a staff. You can jam it into a
thing on the way down.

2182
02:06:11,088 --> 02:06:15,055
MARISHA: Yeah! In more level I get Feather Fall.
That would've been nice.

2183
02:06:15,055 --> 02:06:17,154
LIAM: Your eldritch knight is going to be great.

2184
02:06:17,154 --> 02:06:17,992
MARISHA: Thank you!

2185
02:06:17,992 --> 02:06:20,637
MATT: Oh, actually it doesn't have a roll of
attack against you, technically, so that wouldn't

2186
02:06:20,637 --> 02:06:22,447
have mattered. It's a contested athletics versus
your--

2187
02:06:22,447 --> 02:06:23,939
MARISHA: Versus my strength, right?

2188
02:06:23,939 --> 02:06:26,901
MATT: Versus your athletics or acrobatics, your
choice.

2189
02:06:26,901 --> 02:06:29,173
MARISHA: I'll take the acrobatics.

2190
02:06:29,173 --> 02:06:30,391
LIAM: Come on, ninja!

2191
02:06:30,391 --> 02:06:31,854
TALIESIN: Oh man!

2192
02:06:31,854 --> 02:06:36,774
MATT: I'll check real fast to see if your Patient
Defense affects that at all, not sure if it does.

2193
02:06:36,774 --> 02:06:38,722
TRAVIS: Give her your energy, guys. What the fuck
are you doing?

2194
02:06:38,722 --> 02:06:41,352
TALIESIN: You don't want my energy,
it's been bad.

2195
02:06:41,360 --> 02:06:43,899
TRAVIS and LIAM: (chanting, rhythmic breathing)

2196
02:06:43,899 --> 02:06:46,946
MARISHA: Are you looking for patient defense
shit?

2197
02:06:46,946 --> 02:06:49,686
MATT: Yeah, it doesn't affect this roll,
unfortunately. It's just a straight roll.

2198
02:06:49,686 --> 02:06:50,336
MARISHA: Oh, it doesn't?

2199
02:06:50,336 --> 02:06:53,588
MATT: Nope. It's a contested roll.

2200
02:06:53,857 --> 02:06:56,218
TRAVIS: You got this.

2201
02:06:56,218 --> 02:06:59,554
LIAM: (chanting) Monk monk monk.

2202
02:06:59,554 --> 02:07:02,519
LAURA: (glumly) I know what he rolled.

2203
02:07:02,519 --> 02:07:03,742
MATT: It's a natural 20.

2204
02:07:03,742 --> 02:07:05,232
(yelling)

2205
02:07:05,232 --> 02:07:08,474
MATT: You can come look at The Snitch right now.

2206
02:07:08,474 --> 02:07:10,896
MARISHA: <i>You</i> did this! If I die it's on <i>your</i>
head!

2207
02:07:10,896 --> 02:07:14,179
TALIESIN: You can make this go away at any time.

2208
02:07:14,179 --> 02:07:16,408
MATT: Make your acrobatics check. It's not an
automatic success.

2209
02:07:16,408 --> 02:07:18,751
SAM: Just roll a natural 20.

2210
02:07:18,751 --> 02:07:22,027
MARISHA: Oh my god. Pick the dice that I use.

2211
02:07:22,027 --> 02:07:23,494
LIAM: A natural 20?

2212
02:07:23,494 --> 02:07:24,743
MATT: It's a 23 total. It only has a plus three
strength bonus, so.

2213
02:07:24,743 --> 02:07:27,094
LIAM: This is clearly a case of the husband
favoring the wife.

2214
02:07:27,094 --> 02:07:30,515
MARISHA: I don't want to die. (yelling) Ugh!
Goddamn it! That happened before!

2215
02:07:30,515 --> 02:07:36,822
MATT: It was almost an 18 and it went to a four.
So! He shoves you, not actually with the shield.

2216
02:07:36,822 --> 02:07:40,451
He pulls back and Sparta kicks you. Right as you
turn to try and defend, whack! It hits you right

2217
02:07:40,451 --> 02:07:46,824
in the sternum and you get pushed back five feet,
which puts you right on the edge. I need you to go

2218
02:07:46,824 --> 02:07:50,584
ahead and make a dexterity check to try and catch
yourself.

2219
02:07:50,584 --> 02:07:51,412
MARISHA: Make a what?

2220
02:07:51,412 --> 02:07:52,875
MATT: Dexterity saving throw.

2221
02:07:52,875 --> 02:07:56,635
MARISHA: Saving throw? (Panicked breathing) I'm
good at this.

2222
02:07:56,635 --> 02:07:58,387
LAURA: Don't say those things, Marisha.

2223
02:07:58,387 --> 02:08:03,527
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're not good at anything. Let's
stop pretending that we're good at anything.

2224
02:08:03,527 --> 02:08:05,052
TRAVIS: Yeah, because you did have patient dodge
going, right?

2225
02:08:05,052 --> 02:08:06,114
MARISHA: I had Patient Defense, but--

2226
02:08:06,114 --> 02:08:12,242
MATT: It's against attack rolls, but I feel like I
just saw something. For dodge action, "and you

2227
02:08:12,242 --> 02:08:13,570
make dexterity saving throws with advantage."

2228
02:08:13,570 --> 02:08:15,378
MARISHA: I do?

2229
02:08:15,378 --> 02:08:17,156
MATT: You do, so roll with advantage.

2230
02:08:17,156 --> 02:08:20,961
MATT: It's a high DC, you have to beat I think
with this and the impact that hit you, you have to

2231
02:08:20,961 --> 02:08:24,268
beat an 18, so go for it. You have advantage!

2232
02:08:24,268 --> 02:08:25,485
LAURA: You can do it.

2233
02:08:25,485 --> 02:08:26,691
LIAM: Advantage and have a good bonus.

2234
02:08:26,691 --> 02:08:28,536
MARISHA: I have to roll at least a 12.

2235
02:08:28,536 --> 02:08:30,837
LIAM: You've already fallen off one cliff, you're
not going to do it again.

2236
02:08:30,837 --> 02:08:32,125
MARISHA: That's an 11.

2237
02:08:32,125 --> 02:08:33,571
LAURA: Oh god!

2238
02:08:33,571 --> 02:08:35,614
MARISHA: Please be better.

2239
02:08:35,614 --> 02:08:39,051
LIAM: It's the exact same thing.

2240
02:08:39,051 --> 02:08:42,272
TRAVIS: Two 11s! Two! 11s!

2241
02:08:42,272 --> 02:08:47,034
MATT: You watch as Beau slips, can't get a grip,
and then falls and tumbles into the pit below.

2242
02:08:47,034 --> 02:08:49,358
MARISHA: (fading scream)

2243
02:08:49,358 --> 02:08:51,558
TRAVIS: Oh. Shit.

2244
02:08:51,558 --> 02:08:52,831
LIAM: Blind justice.

2245
02:08:52,831 --> 02:08:55,938
SAM: The pit is six feet deep.

2246
02:08:58,498 --> 02:09:02,861
KHARY: There's a grate on that-- can you grab it?

2247
02:09:02,861 --> 02:09:04,977
MARISHA: Busting fingernails.

2248
02:09:04,977 --> 02:09:09,592
MATT: That's what she was trying to grab as you
fell back. That was the dexterity saving throw,

2249
02:09:09,592 --> 02:09:14,657
because it was a grate. You suffer 11 points of
bludgeoning damage, which-- it's not bad. You fell

2250
02:09:14,657 --> 02:09:20,848
40 feet and landed on your back onto hard rocks
and stones.

2251
02:09:20,848 --> 02:09:23,988
TALIESIN: Could have been worse, although you are
our tank.

2252
02:09:25,425 --> 02:09:30,084
MARISHA: (wheezing) It knocks the air out of me,
so going to be sick, I guess. Hit real good.

2253
02:09:30,084 --> 02:09:32,540
(normally) 11 points?

2254
02:09:32,540 --> 02:09:34,801
KHARY: Did the aid I give help at all with that?

2255
02:09:34,801 --> 02:09:36,146
MATT: Oh yeah!

2256
02:09:36,146 --> 02:09:38,549
MARISHA: Oh, right. Hang on.

2257
02:09:38,549 --> 02:09:42,969
MATT: You have five more hit points than you had
before the battle started.

2258
02:09:42,969 --> 02:09:48,545
TALIESIN: Yeah, it halved the fall damage. That's
so mean.

2259
02:09:48,545 --> 02:09:57,788
MATT: That ends his go. Shakäste, you're up. You
watched Beau fall into this pit behind--

2260
02:09:57,788 --> 02:09:59,908
LIAM: What a turn around.

2261
02:10:02,908 --> 02:10:06,772
KHARY: God.

2262
02:10:06,772 --> 02:10:11,294
MARISHA: (wheezing) I'm good. I'm okay.

2263
02:10:11,294 --> 02:10:14,351
SAM: There's an old man down in the bottom of the
pit.

2264
02:10:14,351 --> 02:10:24,508
KHARY: Good to know. Let's see, I'm running out of
spells. Let's see. I can't do this anymore because

2265
02:10:24,517 --> 02:10:27,767
LIAM: Well, you can do this a million times.

2266
02:10:27,767 --> 02:10:29,793
KHARY: I can do this a million times?

2267
02:10:29,793 --> 02:10:32,261
MATT: You have four 1st-level spells per day you
can cast and two second. You've used one

2268
02:10:32,261 --> 02:10:36,286
2nd-level, so have one of those, and you've cast
Thunderwave before, so you still have three

2269
02:10:36,286 --> 02:10:37,403
1st-level spells.

2270
02:10:37,403 --> 02:10:39,499
KHARY: I still have three 1st-level spells.

2271
02:10:39,499 --> 02:10:42,941
MATT: Correct. You can cast with any of those.

2272
02:10:42,941 --> 02:10:54,232
KHARY: Let's see. Would it be best-- could I
Command the big guy?

2273
02:10:54,232 --> 02:10:56,347
MATT: You could try.

2274
02:10:56,347 --> 02:10:59,287
MARISHA and MATT: You can certainly try.

2275
02:11:01,518 --> 02:11:04,658
MATT: What do you want to Command him to do?

2276
02:11:04,658 --> 02:11:07,506
TRAVIS: Or one of the smaller ones if you want a
higher rate of success, maybe.

2277
02:11:09,496 --> 02:11:12,190
LIAM: Maybe get a little bit closer.

2278
02:11:12,190 --> 02:11:15,564
KHARY: Right, maybe, yeah get a little bit closer
in order to--

2279
02:11:15,564 --> 02:11:17,498
LIAM: Not all the way.

2280
02:11:17,498 --> 02:11:20,258
KHARY: No, I can see him just fine.

2281
02:11:20,258 --> 02:11:22,172
MATT: Yeah, you can see him, the big guy.

2282
02:11:22,172 --> 02:11:24,027
LIAM: 60 feet of range on that.

2283
02:11:24,027 --> 02:11:25,772
KHARY: Yeah, how close am I to him?

2284
02:11:25,772 --> 02:11:28,389
MATT: He's within range. He's about 30 feet from
you.

2285
02:11:28,389 --> 02:11:45,506
KHARY: Let's see, if I asked him to drop or asked
him to fall-- could I ask him to fall on his fellows?

2286
02:11:48,526 --> 02:11:57,517
MATT: You can't ask him to fall on somebody else's
weapon. You can ask him to drop prone if you want to.

2287
02:11:57,591 --> 02:12:00,530
LIAM: Yeah, what are they, like "lie down" or
"drop your weapons" or it's a single word, so

2288
02:12:00,530 --> 02:12:04,725
"drop." Drop everything in his hands, or you could
say "lay."

2289
02:12:04,725 --> 02:12:06,535
SAM: Turn, jump.

2290
02:12:06,535 --> 02:12:10,725
LAURA: Drop his weapon, no don't listen to me, do
what you want.

2291
02:12:10,725 --> 02:12:13,906
LIAM: You could say "dance" and he would just
start dancing.

2292
02:12:13,906 --> 02:12:20,389
KHARY: The target doesn't move and takes no
action. How about-- oh, you know what? Drop,

2293
02:12:21,089 --> 02:12:22,515
TRAVIS: Keep going.

2294
02:12:22,515 --> 02:12:23,426
LAURA: Yeah, that's pretty good.

2295
02:12:23,426 --> 02:12:28,567
KHARY: I say: Halt. I say we tell the big guy to
halt. Not to mention, "halt" is good, because he's

2296
02:12:28,567 --> 02:12:33,369
actually standing in front of his dudes as well,
that'd give them-- that would make it harder for

2297
02:12:33,369 --> 02:12:34,302
them to move.

2298
02:12:34,302 --> 02:12:38,150
MATT: So what do you say as he finishes kicking
Beau into the pit and turns (snarling).

2299
02:12:38,150 --> 02:12:45,929
KHARY: Halt. Is what I say. Halt!

2300
02:12:45,929 --> 02:12:53,372
MATT: It looks back towards you, and I see the
spell DC is 13 for you. That is a two, it does not

2301
02:12:53,372 --> 02:13:00,668
succeed. You watch as it puts its weapons down for
a second and looks right at you, eyes wide,

2302
02:13:00,668 --> 02:13:01,587
confused as it turns its head (inquisitive
sound).

2303
02:13:01,587 --> 02:13:04,094
SAM: Does that last a round?

2304
02:13:04,094 --> 02:13:05,565
LAURA: He keeps his weapons in his hand, though?

2305
02:13:05,565 --> 02:13:07,271
KHARY: Yeah.

2306
02:13:07,271 --> 02:13:09,099
MATT: Yeah, it takes no actions for its next
turn.

2307
02:13:09,099 --> 02:13:11,122
KHARY: Yeah, he doesn't do anything.

2308
02:13:13,522 --> 02:13:17,359
MATT: Do you want to move or stay where you are?

2309
02:13:17,359 --> 02:13:25,149
KHARY: Let's see, I actually feel pretty good
about where I am.

2310
02:13:25,149 --> 02:13:28,085
MATT: It's the gnoll's turn.

2311
02:13:28,085 --> 02:13:29,572
KHARY: I can still see everything, right?

2312
02:13:29,572 --> 02:13:34,818
MATT: Yep. These guys are going to back up a
little bit, and they're both going to take shots,

2313
02:13:34,818 --> 02:13:42,062
one at Molly and one at Jester. At Molly, that is
a 16. What's your armor class?

2314
02:13:42,062 --> 02:13:43,266
TALIESIN: It hits.

2315
02:13:43,266 --> 02:13:48,781
MATT: It hits? You take four points of piercing
damage. Attacking against you, Jester. A natural

2316
02:13:48,781 --> 02:13:50,268
20, I'm sorry.

2317
02:13:50,268 --> 02:13:52,572
LAURA: Could they tell it was my illusion right
there?

2318
02:13:52,572 --> 02:13:56,420
MATT: They noticed earlier, unfortunately.

2319
02:13:56,420 --> 02:13:57,543
LAURA: Damn it.

2320
02:13:57,543 --> 02:14:00,505
MATT: That's okay, it's not too bad. That's eight
points of piercing damage.

2321
02:14:00,505 --> 02:14:08,745
LAURA: Oh. Oh! I'm going to take it.

2322
02:14:08,745 --> 02:14:16,604
MATT: Okay. That ends their turn, Molly, you're up
first.

2323
02:14:16,604 --> 02:14:24,055
TALIESIN: I'm going to rush around to the left of
the big guy. His left, I'm sorry. Right over here.

2324
02:14:24,055 --> 02:14:27,727
Right in there. I'm going to take two shots and
see what happens.

2325
02:14:27,727 --> 02:14:28,694
MATT: Go for it.

2326
02:14:28,694 --> 02:14:30,622
TALIESIN: Do I have advantage or anything because
he's not moving, or--?

2327
02:14:30,622 --> 02:14:32,583
MATT: No, he just doesn't make action on his
turn.

2328
02:14:32,583 --> 02:14:34,066
LAURA: Can he not react either?

2329
02:14:34,066 --> 02:14:38,018
MATT: He can react, but he doesn't-- He can't take
any actions or move on this turn.

2330
02:14:38,018 --> 02:14:41,949
TALIESIN: All right. That hits, that's a 23.

2331
02:14:41,949 --> 02:14:43,044
MATT: That hits, roll damage.

2332
02:14:43,044 --> 02:14:48,511
TALIESIN: I'll roll damage on that. He doesn't get
the bonus, does he? None of that special power

2333
02:14:48,511 --> 02:14:50,354
against him?

2334
02:14:50,354 --> 02:14:51,178
MATT: No, you don't.

2335
02:14:51,178 --> 02:14:55,868
TALIESIN: Ooh, that's nice! 13 points of damage.

2336
02:14:55,868 --> 02:15:01,560
MATT: 13 points of damage from that first strike.
You carve through the body. Its eyes still locked

2337
02:15:01,560 --> 02:15:06,438
on-- (chuckles) Its eyes are still locked on
Shakäste, not looking away, going (grunts).

2338
02:15:06,438 --> 02:15:11,253
TALIESIN: Shot number two is 21 to hit.

2339
02:15:11,253 --> 02:15:12,805
MATT: That hits. Roll damage again for that one.

2340
02:15:12,805 --> 02:15:20,957
TALIESIN: That's seven points of damage. I'm going
to try and see what happens if I disengage.

2341
02:15:20,957 --> 02:15:23,076
MATT: All right. So as you back away.

2342
02:15:23,076 --> 02:15:25,910
TALIESIN: I'm going to back away towards me.

2343
02:15:25,910 --> 02:15:32,530
MATT: That way. It sees you walk away and makes a
strike towards you.

2344
02:15:32,530 --> 02:15:33,697
TALIESIN: Does he try and make his strike?

2345
02:15:33,697 --> 02:15:34,459
MATT: He does.

2346
02:15:34,459 --> 02:15:42,002
TALIESIN: I was just curious. I was going to hit
him if he's going to try and hit me. I'm going to

2347
02:15:42,002 --> 02:15:45,125
hit him right back with Blood Maledict.

2348
02:15:45,125 --> 02:15:47,127
MATT: Okay. That'll give him disadvantage.

2349
02:15:47,127 --> 02:15:53,645
TALIESIN: I'm going to use the full Blood Maledict
so I'm going to take a little damage. Yep. Oh, I

2350
02:15:53,645 --> 02:15:58,727
take my three points of damage. I start bleeding
again from the neck.

2351
02:15:58,727 --> 02:16:03,520
MATT: As his eyes go black and you watch him begin
to bleed from the corners of its eyes.

2352
02:16:03,538 --> 02:16:09,385
MATT: The second roll for that attack was a three
plus five. So yeah, it misses you; it's an eight.

2353
02:16:09,385 --> 02:16:12,366
TALIESIN: I'm going to back up a little further to
get--

2354
02:16:12,366 --> 02:16:13,957
MATT: Like over here?

2355
02:16:13,957 --> 02:16:16,890
MATT: Ending Molly's turn, Nott, you're up.

2356
02:16:16,890 --> 02:16:19,460
TALIESIN: Right up here, if that's okay.

2357
02:16:19,729 --> 02:16:31,038
SAM: No one's in sneaky range. I'm going to caress
the little pouch, little bit. Looking up to Caleb

2358
02:16:31,038 --> 02:16:34,115
to see if he's looking at me at all.

2359
02:16:34,115 --> 02:16:35,795
LIAM: I'm not, by the way.

2360
02:16:35,795 --> 02:16:37,263
MATT: Yes.

2361
02:16:37,263 --> 02:16:46,876
SAM: Trying to make good choices. I will leave the
pouch and draw the hand crossbow and run up a few

2362
02:16:46,876 --> 02:16:53,116
stairs and then I will crouch down on my knee and
hold my attack until someone is within sneak

2363
02:16:53,116 --> 02:16:56,617
attack range.

2364
02:16:56,617 --> 02:17:00,795
MATT: Okay. So you're holding that there. Ending
your turn Nott, Jester, you're up.

2365
02:17:00,795 --> 02:17:07,406
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to run forward and attack
him because he's not moving at all.

2366
02:17:07,406 --> 02:17:08,110
MATT: All right.

2367
02:17:08,110 --> 02:17:09,697
TALIESIN: He doesn't have a reaction, so you can
back away now.

2368
02:17:09,697 --> 02:17:11,661
TRAVIS: Dude, Command is clutch.

2369
02:17:11,661 --> 02:17:18,032
MATT: So both of you guys make your attack. Or
whatever you're doing, Jester.

2370
02:17:18,032 --> 02:17:18,837
LAURA: Yeah.

2371
02:17:18,837 --> 02:17:20,313
SAM: 23.

2372
02:17:20,313 --> 02:17:21,880
LAURA: 16.

2373
02:17:21,880 --> 02:17:27,585
MATT: 16 also hits. Both of you guys roll damage.

2374
02:17:27,585 --> 02:17:29,326
TRAVIS: 16 hits?

2375
02:17:29,326 --> 02:17:29,980
SAM: 15.

2376
02:17:29,980 --> 02:17:32,555
MATT: 15 points of damage.

2377
02:17:32,555 --> 02:17:34,742
LAURA: Four points of damage.

2378
02:17:34,742 --> 02:17:37,442
MATT: How do you guys want to do this?

2379
02:17:37,442 --> 02:17:38,769
(cheering)

2380
02:17:38,769 --> 02:17:41,113
MATT: Currently held.

2381
02:17:41,113 --> 02:17:49,048
LAURA and SAM: (yelling)

2382
02:17:49,048 --> 02:17:51,736
SAM: Jester! We've solved the mystery!

2383
02:17:51,736 --> 02:17:53,497
(laughter)

2384
02:17:53,497 --> 02:17:56,578
SAM: It was him! He did it!

2385
02:17:56,578 --> 02:17:59,632
LAURA: It was you!

2386
02:17:59,632 --> 02:18:02,458
LAURA and SAM: (yelling)

2387
02:18:02,458 --> 02:18:07,024
MATT: As you collide with the gnoll pack lord as
you release a bolt that strikes it in the throat.

2388
02:18:07,024 --> 02:18:10,653
LIAM: We've got four jokes this campaign.

2389
02:18:10,653 --> 02:18:20,724
MATT: The bolt sinks through one of the eyes as
the sickle hits the other and it (choking) and it

2390
02:18:20,724 --> 02:18:24,737
tries to make one final thrust before the halt
magic prevents it from doing so and it (falls).

2391
02:18:24,737 --> 02:18:27,788
MATT: And falls to the ground.

2392
02:18:27,788 --> 02:18:31,627
TRAVIS: Dude, thank you for that. Because of that,
I regain hit points equal to my warlock level plus

2393
02:18:31,627 --> 02:18:33,751
my charisma modifier.

2394
02:18:33,751 --> 02:18:35,726
MARISHA: Oh because your Hex thing?

2395
02:18:35,726 --> 02:18:38,270
TRAVIS: Really appreciate that.

2396
02:18:38,270 --> 02:18:40,227
MARISHA: That's awesome.

2397
02:18:40,516 --> 02:18:44,000
LAURA: Yeah, we do. Wait, what kind of weapon was
that guy holding?

2398
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:48,687
MATT: That was a glaive. It was a large two-handed
polearm with an axe head at the end of it.

2399
02:18:48,687 --> 02:18:49,555
LAURA: That's really big.

2400
02:18:49,555 --> 02:18:51,505
MATT: It's pretty big.

2401
02:18:51,515 --> 02:18:53,924
TRAVIS: Seven points I heal. That's fucking
sweet.

2402
02:18:53,924 --> 02:18:57,485
KHARY: Which means to bluff.

2403
02:18:57,485 --> 02:19:00,125
TRAVIS: To blathe!

2404
02:19:00,125 --> 02:19:04,488
MATT: That ends Jester's turn. That brings us to
Beau.

2405
02:19:04,488 --> 02:19:06,459
MARISHA: (groaning)

2406
02:19:06,459 --> 02:19:10,983
MATT: You're like (groaning). You get up from
prone, so it's half your movement.

2407
02:19:10,983 --> 02:19:14,192
MARISHA: Fuck, that's half of my damn movement?

2408
02:19:14,192 --> 02:19:19,906
MARISHA: All right. Can I do some cool monk shit
and do like a (wall jumping) to get out?

2409
02:19:19,906 --> 02:19:23,464
MATT: It is a small enough space, I'll let you
make an athletics check or acrobatics check

2410
02:19:23,464 --> 02:19:24,726
instead of athletics.

2411
02:19:24,726 --> 02:19:27,792
MARISHA: Is it small enough to where I can do the
wedge myself--

2412
02:19:27,792 --> 02:19:29,811
MATT: It is not small enough for that,
unfortunately. It's about a ten foot gap, but you

2413
02:19:29,811 --> 02:19:33,293
can leap from side to side or you can climb with
athletics. It's your choice.

2414
02:19:33,293 --> 02:19:36,984
MARISHA: Is leap from side to side also
athletics?

2415
02:19:36,984 --> 02:19:38,216
MATT: That's acrobatics to do that.

2416
02:19:38,216 --> 02:19:39,494
MARISHA: Yeah, that one. Let's do that one.

2417
02:19:39,494 --> 02:19:41,434
MATT: It's monkish. Go for it.

2418
02:19:41,434 --> 02:19:43,375
MARISHA: Monkish? Okay. 19.

2419
02:19:43,375 --> 02:19:49,349
MATT: You leap, leap, leap, leap. You get about 20
feet up your movement before you have to grab onto

2420
02:19:49,349 --> 02:19:50,256
the wall to stop yourself.

2421
02:19:50,256 --> 02:19:51,006
MARISHA: 18. Sorry.

2422
02:19:51,006 --> 02:19:54,926
MATT: That's fine. Still enough. And if you wanted
to use an action to dash, you could make it the

2423
02:19:54,926 --> 02:19:55,857
rest of the way up.

2424
02:19:55,857 --> 02:19:57,691
MARISHA: Yes.

2425
02:19:57,691 --> 02:20:01,610
MATT: Pole vaulting off, parkouring up the wall
until eventually you leap and get back up to the top.

2426
02:20:01,610 --> 02:20:02,102
TRAVIS: Hey!

2427
02:20:02,102 --> 02:20:05,969
MARISHA: Did you guys know there's a hole?

2428
02:20:05,969 --> 02:20:09,465
TALIESIN: I did not know that. Did not know that.

2429
02:20:09,465 --> 02:20:11,284
TRAVIS: We did not.

2430
02:20:11,284 --> 02:20:15,106
MARISHA: Now I climbed out of the hole to two
gnolls. Hole to gnoll?

2431
02:20:15,106 --> 02:20:15,924
MATT: Yep.

2432
02:20:16,106 --> 02:20:17,478
MARISHA: Cool.

2433
02:20:17,478 --> 02:20:20,205
MATT: Ending Beau's turn, Caleb, you're up.

2434
02:20:20,205 --> 02:20:23,970
LIAM: Caleb, who was just going into his bag to
pull out a ro-- oh, she does not need the rope,

2435
02:20:23,970 --> 02:20:28,507
okay. So instead I pull out the diamond and I
start spinning it around and it turns to thunder

2436
02:20:28,526 --> 02:20:35,271
and I sent that flying into the tannish colored--
Chromatic Orb to that one, yeah.

2437
02:20:35,271 --> 02:20:37,830
MATT: Right there? All right, roll for the
attack.

2438
02:20:37,830 --> 02:20:40,104
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Thunder.

2439
02:20:40,104 --> 02:20:42,285
LIAM: That hits. That is a 20 to hit.

2440
02:20:42,285 --> 02:20:43,198
MATT: 20 hits. Roll damage.

2441
02:20:43,198 --> 02:20:53,723
LIAM: Yeah. This is thunder damage is a total
of... oh, just eight, you know. Just eight points

2442
02:20:53,723 --> 02:20:54,915
of thunder damage.

2443
02:20:54,915 --> 02:20:58,853
MATT: Eight points of damage. It impacts and it
looks like really hurt now and it's like (heavy

2444
02:20:58,853 --> 02:21:03,189
breathing). It's getting ready to run. It looks
like it's in the process of deciding to flee.

2445
02:21:03,189 --> 02:21:08,084
LIAM: Okay. This looks good. I'm going to back
down the stairs and stand by Shakäste, I think.

2446
02:21:08,084 --> 02:21:09,852
Diplomatic immunity!

2447
02:21:09,852 --> 02:21:12,734
(laughter)

2448
02:21:12,734 --> 02:21:14,876
MATT: Finishing Caleb's turn, Fjord, you're up.

2449
02:21:14,876 --> 02:21:18,417
TRAVIS: Can I use my full movement to come back up
the stairs as far as I can? 30 feet.

2450
02:21:18,417 --> 02:21:19,897
MATT: There you go.

2451
02:21:19,897 --> 02:21:22,897
TRAVIS: Eldritch Blast into the darker gnoll.
Yes.

2452
02:21:22,897 --> 02:21:24,270
MATT: Go for it. Roll to attack.

2453
02:21:24,270 --> 02:21:27,265
TRAVIS: Plus six. That is 21.

2454
02:21:27,265 --> 02:21:28,885
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

2455
02:21:28,885 --> 02:21:35,922
TRAVIS: All right. That is (counting) 15 points of
Eldritch Blast damage.

2456
02:21:35,922 --> 02:21:39,521
MATT: That one, seeing the other one about to
flee, tries to turn to meet gait right before your

2457
02:21:39,521 --> 02:21:44,301
Eldritch Blast slams it in the back and core
through its abdomen, leaving this burning hole in

2458
02:21:44,301 --> 02:21:50,538
the center before it falls to the ground and
collapses dead. Its friend going (whimpering).

2459
02:21:50,538 --> 02:21:53,883
It's now looking scared and ready to bolt. That
ends Fjord's turn.

2460
02:21:53,883 --> 02:21:55,392
TRAVIS: Yes.

2461
02:21:55,392 --> 02:21:59,902
MATT: Pack lord's gone. Shakäste, you're up. There
is this one who's very wounded and about to flee.

2462
02:21:59,902 --> 02:22:09,389
KHARY: Yes. I will run a few steps up and hit it
with Sacred Flame.

2463
02:22:09,389 --> 02:22:16,144
MATT: All righty. That is a natural four. It does
not succeed so roll damage on that one. d8 radiant

2464
02:22:16,144 --> 02:22:17,463
damage.

2465
02:22:17,463 --> 02:22:19,821
LAURA: You got up!

2466
02:22:19,821 --> 02:22:22,485
MARISHA: I did! It took everything.

2467
02:22:22,495 --> 02:22:26,625
LIAM: All good! <i>Sechs!</i><i>Sechs-y</i>.

2468
02:22:26,625 --> 02:22:27,533
KHARY: Six.

2469
02:22:27,533 --> 02:22:36,520
MATT: Six points of damage. That's-- aw man,
almost! As it bursts into flame, its body is now

2470
02:22:36,520 --> 02:22:42,612
singed by the radiant energy that's burned around
its torso. It's breathing heavy and limping and

2471
02:22:42,612 --> 02:22:45,177
it's going to go ahead and-- is that the end of
your turn?

2472
02:22:45,177 --> 02:22:48,688
KHARY: <i>Is</i> that the end of my turn? That's a
great question.

2473
02:22:48,688 --> 02:22:50,582
MATT: That's your movement, your action so.

2474
02:22:50,582 --> 02:22:53,584
KHARY: I moved and I action so bonus action? Is
there some?

2475
02:22:53,584 --> 02:22:55,824
MATT: If you have anything that could use a bonus
action.

2476
02:22:55,824 --> 02:22:58,090
KHARY: I know that there's something here that has
a bonus action.

2477
02:22:58,090 --> 02:23:00,040
MATT: You have a spell that does it, but I don't
think it's going to be helpful right now.

2478
02:23:00,040 --> 02:23:02,341
LIAM: Spiritual Weapon.

2479
02:23:02,341 --> 02:23:04,218
KHARY and LIAM: Nah.

2480
02:23:04,218 --> 02:23:07,742
MATT: Yeah, hold off on that. Okay, so that ends
your turn. It's going to turn and bolt. It was

2481
02:23:07,742 --> 02:23:09,662
right up against you, so you do get an attack of
opportunity on it.

2482
02:23:09,662 --> 02:23:12,491
MARISHA: Oh, yes! Fuck you!

2483
02:23:12,491 --> 02:23:15,211
LIAM: It's got one hit point.

2484
02:23:15,211 --> 02:23:17,348
MARISHA and LIAM: Yes!

2485
02:23:17,348 --> 02:23:18,699
MATT: Roll damage.

2486
02:23:18,699 --> 02:23:25,538
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay. One! Plus four, so five
damage.

2487
02:23:25,538 --> 02:23:27,070
(cheering)

2488
02:23:27,070 --> 02:23:30,618
MATT: As it spins to run away, you're like "No you
don't!" (whack) and slam it on the head. It falls.

2489
02:23:30,618 --> 02:23:35,914
(grunt) "Again!" You just slowly bash it to the
ground until its head's a mashed-in pulp.

2490
02:23:35,914 --> 02:23:41,147
(cheering)

2491
02:23:41,147 --> 02:23:42,606
LAURA: Wait! Not the pulp, we need the ears!

2492
02:23:42,606 --> 02:23:45,316
MARISHA: Oh shit. Oh no. Is there still an ear
left?

2493
02:23:45,316 --> 02:23:51,535
MATT: Yeah, you can pull the ears out. There a
little wet, but they're functional.

2494
02:23:51,535 --> 02:23:54,656
LAURA: That's three gnoll sets and I'm going to
mark one as super special because it's big.

2495
02:23:54,656 --> 02:23:57,754
TALIESIN: We're also going to go through the
pockets of the big one, obviously.

2496
02:23:57,754 --> 02:23:58,670
LAURA: Yeah.

2497
02:23:58,670 --> 02:24:01,229
MATT: All right. we'll come back and begin that
right after we take a quick break. So we're going

2498
02:24:01,229 --> 02:24:06,165
to take a quick break. I'm going to sit back down
here. We'll continue the story here in just a

2499
02:24:06,165 --> 02:24:11,078
moment, but before we do that, real fast, we have
a couple things. One, we have a gift here from

2500
02:24:11,078 --> 02:24:15,807
Wyrmwood for our resident monk over there.

2501
02:24:15,807 --> 02:24:16,660
MARISHA: What, really?

2502
02:24:16,660 --> 02:24:19,029
LIAM: With a letter.

2503
02:24:19,029 --> 02:24:21,033
SAM: I didn't get a letter!

2504
02:24:21,033 --> 02:24:23,259
MATT: Apparently, she's got fans at Wyrmwood.

2505
02:24:23,259 --> 02:24:25,209
LIAM: Patrick Rothfuss again?

2506
02:24:25,209 --> 02:24:29,793
MARISHA: Oh wait, this is to all-- wait. Oh. It
was probably addressed to me because of Geek &

2507
02:24:29,793 --> 02:24:30,684
Sundry.

2508
02:24:30,684 --> 02:24:31,809
MATT: That's probably it.

2509
02:24:31,809 --> 02:24:37,046
MARISHA: But this is to all of us. "To the cast of
Critical Role, while--" Hang on, let me make

2510
02:24:37,046 --> 02:24:38,016
sure.

2511
02:24:38,016 --> 02:24:39,111
SAM: It's mostly cursing.

2512
02:24:39,111 --> 02:24:41,045
TRAVIS: What is that word down there?

2513
02:24:41,045 --> 02:24:47,945
MATT: Open it! While she's reading it. Wyrmwood is
giving away two Adventurer's Arsenals, which we've

2514
02:24:47,945 --> 02:24:53,085
shown previously on weeks here, that are zebra
wood. If you guys haven't seen it, Wyrmwood's last

2515
02:24:53,085 --> 02:24:59,810
Kickstarter. It's a packaged dice box and then on
the inside, holds your dice, holds your pencil or

2516
02:24:59,810 --> 02:25:05,642
pen, eraser or mini. All magnetized in there.
We're giving away two of these at the break to

2517
02:25:05,642 --> 02:25:08,479
anybody who wants to enter.

2518
02:25:08,479 --> 02:25:10,005
MARISHA: It's mine.

2519
02:25:10,005 --> 02:25:11,032
LIAM: It's yours.

2520
02:25:11,032 --> 02:25:13,751
MARISHA: Yeah. It is a gift for me.

2521
02:25:13,751 --> 02:25:14,551
MATT: There you go.

2522
02:25:14,551 --> 02:25:17,433
MARISHA: It's so great.

2523
02:25:17,433 --> 02:25:20,211
LAURA: Thanks, Wyrmwood. Thanks for Marisha.

2524
02:25:20,211 --> 02:25:24,495
MATT: Oh, they give us plenty. Anyway, two of you
will win this. When you're prompted in the chat

2525
02:25:24,495 --> 02:25:32,010
and only in Twitch chat, to use the keyword
'hush'. H-U-ace-H-S. H-U-S-H. There we go, I can

2526
02:25:32,010 --> 02:25:37,588
spell. Brain not working, too much math. Hush in
the chat, when you're prompted. Only enter once or

2527
02:25:37,588 --> 02:25:41,189
you'll be disqualified, but we'll come back with
two winners after the break. We'll see you guys

2528
02:25:41,189 --> 02:25:42,600
here in a few minutes.

2529
02:25:42,600 --> 02:25:44,192
TRAVIS: I've gotta pee!

2530
02:25:44,192 --> 02:25:45,291
TALIESIN: Nice.

2531
02:25:45,291 --> 02:25:52,743
[break]

2532
02:38:01,490 --> 02:38:05,272
MATT: Hello and welcome back everybody. So, before
we jump in here, we have our two winners in the

2533
02:38:05,272 --> 02:38:08,793
chat of the Wyrmwood giveaway. They are
Grugswald.

2534
02:38:08,793 --> 02:38:09,450
LIAM: Yeah.

2535
02:38:09,450 --> 02:38:16,231
MATT: Grugswald and onegirlx10. Congratulations to
you guys, Grugswold and onegirlx10, Danoba will

2536
02:38:16,231 --> 02:38:20,536
contact you and get your information and get those
sent to you in the chat. Congratulations and we'll

2537
02:38:20,536 --> 02:38:25,061
have more of these in future episodes. They're
awesome. They're pretty rad.

2538
02:38:25,061 --> 02:38:30,017
MARISHA: They came fully stocked. Look at that.
Look at how jealous Laura is. Look at that. It

2539
02:38:30,017 --> 02:38:32,850
fuels me. I love it.

2540
02:38:32,850 --> 02:38:33,880
MATT: I would be careful.

2541
02:38:33,880 --> 02:38:39,226
TALIESIN: I'm here more than you these days. You
better hide that thing.

2542
02:38:42,466 --> 02:38:44,796
TRAVIS: Other people's dice.

2543
02:38:44,796 --> 02:38:49,989
LIAM: All those dice that you could check before
the game. You could roll them.

2544
02:38:49,989 --> 02:38:52,607
MATT: Bringing it back in, guys.

2545
02:38:52,607 --> 02:38:53,560
LIAM: We're all real good friends.

2546
02:38:53,560 --> 02:38:55,928
MATT: I know.

2547
02:38:55,928 --> 02:38:58,131
(laughter)

2548
02:38:58,131 --> 02:39:00,037
LAURA: No. Congratulations, Marisha.

2549
02:39:00,037 --> 02:39:04,921
TALIESIN: So happy for you.

2550
02:39:04,921 --> 02:39:11,295
MATT: You guys, finishing this fray, you gather
the gnoll ears as well as--

2551
02:39:11,295 --> 02:39:13,465
LAURA: Rummage through their bodies.

2552
02:39:13,465 --> 02:39:16,821
MATT: Make an investigation check. The two of you
who are investigating their bodies.

2553
02:39:16,821 --> 02:39:18,416
TALIESIN: I'll give advantage.

2554
02:39:18,416 --> 02:39:19,958
MATT: Okay.

2555
02:39:19,967 --> 02:39:21,202
TALIESIN: Advantage.

2556
02:39:21,202 --> 02:39:23,041
LAURA: I did. I know. I'm doing that.

2557
02:39:23,041 --> 02:39:25,114
TALIESIN: Yeah. That's not good.

2558
02:39:25,114 --> 02:39:27,072
LAURA: (yelling) Did you see that?

2559
02:39:27,072 --> 02:39:27,814
TALIESIN: That's cocked. Well.

2560
02:39:27,814 --> 02:39:30,648
LAURA: That is not cocked. I rolled a one and a
two.

2561
02:39:30,648 --> 02:39:31,436
MATT: Aw.

2562
02:39:31,436 --> 02:39:36,443
LAURA: So yeah. A three for investigation.

2563
02:39:36,443 --> 02:39:41,846
MATT: Okay. Well, there's the glaive. It's hard to
miss that. It's pretty well-made; it's sturdy, it

2564
02:39:41,846 --> 02:39:45,809
has some of the spines that are part of the armor
as well affixed to it along the top.

2565
02:39:45,809 --> 02:39:48,225
LAURA: I'm going to take it. How heavy is it?

2566
02:39:48,225 --> 02:39:55,945
MATT: It's like-- Let me look at how much a glaive
weighs according to the book. The glaive is about

2567
02:39:55,945 --> 02:40:01,568
six pounds. It's not too bad. Well, this one's
probably closer to ten. It's a pretty top-heavy.

2568
02:40:01,568 --> 02:40:06,858
It's designed for a gnoll. Or at least designed
for something big that wants to hurt something

2569
02:40:06,858 --> 02:40:16,474
badly. You do manage through a collection of
shinies in the pack leader's pockets and manage to

2570
02:40:16,474 --> 02:40:22,827
find roughly 13 gold pieces, three silver and no
copper. It only wants things that are shiny.

2571
02:40:22,827 --> 02:40:24,503
Copper aren't as shiny to them.

2572
02:40:24,503 --> 02:40:25,665
LAURA: Who wants this gold? Anybody?

2573
02:40:25,665 --> 02:40:27,956
TALIESIN: Never say no to gold.

2574
02:40:27,956 --> 02:40:30,403
KHARY: I could use it.

2575
02:40:30,403 --> 02:40:31,412
LAURA: Yeah?

2576
02:40:31,412 --> 02:40:32,471
KHARY: Sure.

2577
02:40:32,471 --> 02:40:35,262
LAURA: Here is three gold for you.

2578
02:40:35,262 --> 02:40:37,177
KHARY: You are the best thing.

2579
02:40:37,177 --> 02:40:38,007
LAURA: Here is three gold for you.

2580
02:40:38,007 --> 02:40:39,795
LIAM: How much was in there?

2581
02:40:39,795 --> 02:40:43,783
LAURA: There's seven gold left. Here's three gold
for you.

2582
02:40:43,783 --> 02:40:47,001
SAM: Where does Shakäste?

2583
02:40:47,001 --> 02:40:47,759
MATT: Mm-hmm. Shakäste.

2584
02:40:47,759 --> 02:40:50,209
SAM: Where does Shakäste put the gold?

2585
02:40:50,209 --> 02:40:52,575
MATT: Where does Shakäste put the gold?

2586
02:40:53,565 --> 02:40:55,721
KHARY: I put it in my--

2587
02:40:55,721 --> 02:40:58,794
MATT: You can do it discreetly if you want to.

2588
02:41:01,434 --> 02:41:07,584
KHARY: Well, I suppose a blind man does put his
gold in his back pocket pretty discreetly,

2589
02:41:07,584 --> 02:41:10,913
actually. He doesn't have to look at it.

2590
02:41:10,913 --> 02:41:14,223
MATT: Make a stealth check. Or a sleight of hand
check.

2591
02:41:14,223 --> 02:41:17,043
LAURA: Three gold for you. I've got one gold
left.

2592
02:41:17,043 --> 02:41:18,584
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll take it.

2593
02:41:18,584 --> 02:41:20,161
KHARY: It's a nine.

2594
02:41:20,161 --> 02:41:22,866
MATT: Plus what's your sleight of hand skill?

2595
02:41:22,866 --> 02:41:25,489
KHARY: Sleight of hand is plus five.

2596
02:41:25,489 --> 02:41:27,615
MATT: So 14. Make a perception check.

2597
02:41:28,955 --> 02:41:30,077
SAM: Seven.

2598
02:41:30,077 --> 02:41:33,814
MATT: Yeah, so you have no idea. He receives the
gold and the hand disappears beneath the cloak

2599
02:41:33,814 --> 02:41:37,034
which is now covering most of his torso and you
have no idea where it got put.

2600
02:41:38,564 --> 02:41:41,361
LAURA: How much silver did you say there was?

2601
02:41:41,361 --> 02:41:42,502
MATT: Two silver.

2602
02:41:43,482 --> 02:41:51,103
KHARY: Do I notice her looking at me? I mean, does
Anastasia notice her looking at me?

2603
02:41:51,103 --> 02:41:54,113
MATT: I mean, no more than anybody looks at
anybody.

2604
02:41:54,113 --> 02:41:55,145
KHARY: All right.

2605
02:41:55,145 --> 02:42:01,509
MATT: The little goblin girl isn't leering at you.
I mean, has been leering at you since you arrived

2606
02:42:01,509 --> 02:42:04,056
but nothing in a way that catches your attention.

2607
02:42:04,056 --> 02:42:06,355
KHARY: Nothing out of the ordinary. Very good.
Nice to know.

2608
02:42:08,515 --> 02:42:12,343
MATT: Make an insight check. Roll a d20 and add
your insight skill.

2609
02:42:12,343 --> 02:42:22,519
KHARY: Insight. Nine. Nine plus insight is plus
three so, eh.

2610
02:42:22,519 --> 02:42:25,398
MATT: It's a 12. I'd say, yeah. No more than
usual.

2611
02:42:25,398 --> 02:42:28,164
KHARY: Right. She's got awfully big eyes.

2612
02:42:28,164 --> 02:42:35,268
MATT: As you guys get closer to the exit where
this broken, hinged archway was, this double door

2613
02:42:35,268 --> 02:42:42,382
archway about eight to ten feet wide, a new smell
rushes into your nose. Whereas previously it had

2614
02:42:42,382 --> 02:42:51,562
been just decaying earth and dust there's now this
musky smell that resembles the faint mixture of

2615
02:42:51,562 --> 02:42:57,163
urine and citrus. It's hard to place, but it's new
and it's different than the rest of the mines

2616
02:42:57,163 --> 02:42:58,974
you've been through.

2617
02:42:58,974 --> 02:43:00,150
LIAM: It's a step up for me.

2618
02:43:00,150 --> 02:43:01,607
SAM: We got all the ears?

2619
02:43:01,607 --> 02:43:07,280
LAURA: We got all the ears. Should we search for
more survivors and then burn it to the ground?

2620
02:43:07,280 --> 02:43:10,180
LIAM: Like the mine?

2621
02:43:10,454 --> 02:43:10,754
LAURA: Yeah.

2622
02:43:10,754 --> 02:43:11,254
LIAM: Burn the mine to the ground? Under the
ground?

2623
02:43:11,254 --> 02:43:14,149
LAURA: Well, we can explode it.

2624
02:43:14,149 --> 02:43:15,885
TALIESIN: You can.

2625
02:43:15,885 --> 02:43:20,696
KHARY: I appreciate your excitability. Why don't I
let the bird do the talking?

2626
02:43:20,696 --> 02:43:24,163
LAURA: You mean search for people?

2627
02:43:24,163 --> 02:43:26,156
KHARY: That's what I meant, baby. Thank you.

2628
02:43:26,156 --> 02:43:36,230
MATT: (humming) You watch at the Duchess makes her
way further down the tunnel.

2629
02:43:36,230 --> 02:43:43,073
SAM: As the Duchess flies away, I push on
Shakäste's body a little bit and see if I get any

2630
02:43:43,073 --> 02:43:44,629
reaction.

2631
02:43:44,629 --> 02:43:53,910
MATT: You feel this tiny goblin hand push on you.
There does not seem to be a reaction.

2632
02:43:53,910 --> 02:43:57,820
SAM: I'm going to pick the pocket of Shakäste.

2633
02:43:57,820 --> 02:44:02,437
MATT: As you're focused currently to the vision of
your-- you do not sense--

2634
02:44:02,437 --> 02:44:04,862
KHARY: I do not sense a thing?

2635
02:44:04,862 --> 02:44:10,838
MATT: You do not because currently all of your
senses are through your familiar. So unfortunately no.

2636
02:44:10,838 --> 02:44:13,139
KHARY: That's fine by me.

2637
02:44:13,139 --> 02:44:14,575
TALIESIN: Do any of us notice this?

2638
02:44:14,575 --> 02:44:17,051
SAM: I will use sleight of hand to conceal this
from the group.

2639
02:44:17,051 --> 02:44:19,139
MATT: You will have to, so make a sleight of hand
check.

2640
02:44:19,139 --> 02:44:21,278
SAM: Okay. Yeah, okay, that's not great.

2641
02:44:21,278 --> 02:44:25,398
LIAM: Our guests are like farm animals that we
mine for loot.

2642
02:44:25,398 --> 02:44:26,767
SAM: 14.

2643
02:44:28,477 --> 02:44:36,180
MATT: 14. Nobody has a passive perception higher
than a 13, I think.

2644
02:44:36,180 --> 02:44:38,166
MARISHA and LAURA: Mine's 13.

2645
02:44:38,166 --> 02:44:39,393
TRAVIS: Negative.

2646
02:44:39,393 --> 02:44:40,494
TALIESIN: Yep. 13.

2647
02:44:40,494 --> 02:44:41,888
MATT: All right.

2648
02:44:43,888 --> 02:44:46,847
TRAVIS: Horrible bastard.

2649
02:44:46,847 --> 02:44:51,386
MATT: Go ahead and mark nine gold pieces off of
your total and you take nine gold.

2650
02:44:51,386 --> 02:44:52,696
SAM: I'm going for that pouch.

2651
02:44:52,696 --> 02:44:54,387
MATT: The whole pouch?

2652
02:44:54,387 --> 02:44:59,453
KHARY: You're going for the whole-- Wait, I
wouldn't feel the entire pouch being pulled off of my--

2653
02:44:59,453 --> 02:45:05,107
MATT: You don't, unfortunately, because your
senses. Well wait, no, it's sight and hearing,

2654
02:45:05,107 --> 02:45:06,006
isn't it?

2655
02:45:06,546 --> 02:45:09,424
LIAM: It's sight and hearing for Find Familiar.

2656
02:45:09,424 --> 02:45:15,362
MATT: That's right! I take it back. He didn't
react to you being touched earlier, but I need you

2657
02:45:15,362 --> 02:45:17,531
to go ahead and make a perception check.

2658
02:45:19,521 --> 02:45:22,458
LIAM: Nah, it's pretty good.

2659
02:45:22,458 --> 02:45:23,448
KHARY: 13.

2660
02:45:23,448 --> 02:45:25,755
MATT: Plus what is your perception skill?

2661
02:45:25,755 --> 02:45:27,832
KHARY: Plus insight or--?

2662
02:45:28,472 --> 02:45:29,548
LIAM: There it is, 16.

2663
02:45:29,548 --> 02:45:30,559
KHARY: Perception? 16.

2664
02:45:31,439 --> 02:45:39,448
MATT: After the initial pat, you were focused, it
didn't bother much. You feel your belt tug a bit

2665
02:45:39,448 --> 02:45:47,110
and you feel suddenly the back of your armor begin
to get a little lighter as your pouch is

2666
02:45:47,110 --> 02:45:50,256
noticeably being removed from your person.

2667
02:45:50,256 --> 02:45:52,891
SAM: He doesn't know by whom!

2668
02:45:52,891 --> 02:45:53,695
MATT: No.

2669
02:45:53,695 --> 02:45:56,479
SAM: Just knows that it's happening?

2670
02:45:56,479 --> 02:45:57,892
MATT: It's happening.

2671
02:45:57,892 --> 02:45:58,592
SAM: And can't react?

2672
02:45:58,592 --> 02:45:59,856
MATT: I mean, he can if he chooses too.

2673
02:45:59,856 --> 02:46:01,265
SAM: Oh god.

2674
02:46:01,265 --> 02:46:03,324
MATT: Shakäste, do you want to do anything?

2675
02:46:03,324 --> 02:46:06,389
MARISHA: You have a height that's very
identifiable. It's a very recognizable level

2676
02:46:06,389 --> 02:46:07,523
you're on.

2677
02:46:09,523 --> 02:46:13,392
KHARY: No, I don't want to do anything.

2678
02:46:13,392 --> 02:46:17,030
MATT: You undo the pouch and now have it in your
possession. As you're focusing through the

2679
02:46:17,030 --> 02:46:25,439
Duchess's vision, beyond the broken doorway the
tunnel grows rougher as you sense that the deeper

2680
02:46:25,439 --> 02:46:30,516
shafts of the mines are coming to an end fairly
soon. The scent the Duchess is picking up is

2681
02:46:30,516 --> 02:46:39,554
strong, that weird musky smell. After about 100
feet of it snaking a little bit forward, through

2682
02:46:39,554 --> 02:46:45,556
ten, 15 foot wide tunnels, suddenly the tunnel
opens, into a large, rocky alcove formation,

2683
02:46:45,556 --> 02:46:52,682
stalactites from the ceiling, and some elements of
broken digging equipment around the corners of

2684
02:46:52,682 --> 02:47:01,121
this chamber. The uneven ceilings stand about 15
to 20 feet tall within in places, and are scarred

2685
02:47:02,365 --> 02:47:07,288
with pick marks from various attempts to meet the
end of the mine, which apparently were not enough

2686
02:47:07,288 --> 02:47:11,794
to keep the mine in business. A rough slope
descends from the immediate entrance to this

2687
02:47:11,794 --> 02:47:19,244
tunnel, hits the wall before it, rises a few feet
past that to a smaller platform that meets the

2688
02:47:19,244 --> 02:47:23,719
opposite side of the wall, about 70 or 80 feet to
the other side. The chamber's about 80-foot from

2689
02:47:23,719 --> 02:47:33,484
where you enter to the opposite end. Near the base
of the raised rock you see two humanoid figures,

2690
02:47:33,484 --> 02:47:43,635
sitting against each other, bound tightly in ropes
and above the platform on top, you see a figure

2691
02:47:43,635 --> 02:47:51,964
you haven't seen yet. Human-like, but seems to
have large chunks of gnoll flesh strapped to their

2692
02:47:51,964 --> 02:47:58,956
body, like they used a disembodied gnoll arm as a
glove, a gnoll head with the jaw removed and

2693
02:47:58,956 --> 02:48:05,578
hollowed out used as a hood. There is this
individual carrying baubles and chains of some

2694
02:48:05,578 --> 02:48:10,586
symbols across their neck and they're spattered
with blood. They're standing at the top, currently

2695
02:48:10,586 --> 02:48:15,644
holding a third humanoid figure who is bound in
ropes, and dragging them up the stairs to this

2696
02:48:15,644 --> 02:48:24,737
platform on the opposite end. Next to this
gnoll-wearing priestly-like figure, you see the

2697
02:48:24,737 --> 02:48:29,143
figure in their arm is a guard, one of the
Crownsguard of Alfield. You don't recognize him at

2698
02:48:29,143 --> 02:48:34,976
a glance, but you can see they are currently still
living, bloodied and are being dragged up to the

2699
02:48:34,976 --> 02:48:45,944
top of this platform. You can see right at the top
of this raised section a monstrous mound of broken

2700
02:48:45,944 --> 02:48:52,638
wood, rope, burlap and scrap from nearby within
the mine that has been amassed into this large

2701
02:48:52,638 --> 02:49:03,666
pile. At that moment a majority of the mound
begins to move and shift, as two large, brown red,

2702
02:49:03,666 --> 02:49:17,008
leathery wings unfurl from the mound. Where a
fur-covered body steps out. Is the Duchess going

2703
02:49:17,008 --> 02:49:18,202
to stay and continue to watch?

2704
02:49:18,202 --> 02:49:24,049
KHARY: I can explain what is happening as she
sees.

2705
02:49:24,049 --> 02:49:25,463
MATT: You can. You are describing this verbally to
everybody?

2706
02:49:25,463 --> 02:49:28,281
KHARY: Yes, absolutely.

2707
02:49:28,281 --> 02:49:30,056
LAURA: What should we do? What should we do?

2708
02:49:30,056 --> 02:49:34,783
KHARY: We should wait and see what else unfurls in
this thing.

2709
02:49:34,783 --> 02:49:45,738
MATT: This creature stands up from within this
pile, you can now see this large, lion-like body

2710
02:49:45,738 --> 02:49:53,519
and torso the size of a rhinoceros, massive and
muscled, with giant clawed paws. Around the neck

2711
02:49:53,519 --> 02:50:03,819
you see this thick, red, fiery mane of hair and a
humanoid female face, dark and tanned, with this

2712
02:50:03,819 --> 02:50:09,349
large, curled grin. The mouth that opens and hangs
with rows of sharp teeth, but weirdly humanoid in

2713
02:50:09,349 --> 02:50:16,805
appearance. It turns its head towards this
priestly figure, who thrusts the guard to the

2714
02:50:16,805 --> 02:50:24,791
front and says "Come, gifted mother. Feed and may
you grow strong. Your strength is a boon from

2715
02:50:24,791 --> 02:50:30,532
Yeenoghu, and one that will bring us much more
meat in the time to come," and kicks the guard

2716
02:50:30,532 --> 02:50:40,796
forward. This large beast turns, and inspects the
frightened, shaking, and sobbing guard. "Your god

2717
02:50:40,796 --> 02:50:52,981
meats hold me to nothing, but your offer pleases
me and my child." As the beast stands up further

2718
02:50:52,981 --> 02:51:04,428
in this pile of rough, found pieces of wood and
twine, a small infant of its same species seems to

2719
02:51:04,428 --> 02:51:11,008
be wound up and begins to mewl in its place. It's
pawing at the air, its eyes not even freshly

2720
02:51:11,008 --> 02:51:19,051
opened. This creature steps forward and bites into
the Crownsguard and lifts it up as he begins to

2721
02:51:19,051 --> 02:51:22,924
scream. The rest of you hear the echoing screaming
in the distance of the Crownsguard.

2722
02:51:22,924 --> 02:51:24,123
LAURA: I think that means he ate him!

2723
02:51:24,123 --> 02:51:31,046
MATT: As it begins to bite and crunch, pulling its
jaw open, it tears it into two halves and begins

2724
02:51:31,046 --> 02:51:33,056
to chew on the upper torso. The screaming has
stopped.

2725
02:51:33,056 --> 02:51:35,518
SAM: Get your medical kit ready.

2726
02:51:35,518 --> 02:51:37,704
LAURA: Don't think it's going to help.

2727
02:51:37,704 --> 02:51:39,840
KHARY: There are two people left?

2728
02:51:39,840 --> 02:51:45,125
MATT: There are two people left in the room and
you can look around the vicinity. It looks like

2729
02:51:45,125 --> 02:51:49,366
there were more people in here that have probably
been fed over the past hour.

2730
02:51:49,366 --> 02:51:58,050
KHARY: This sacrifice will not end. First, Duchess
come back to me.

2731
02:51:58,050 --> 02:51:59,483
LAURA: Should we go in?

2732
02:51:59,483 --> 02:52:03,519
KHARY: We should talk. This is going to take a
minute.

2733
02:52:03,519 --> 02:52:12,047
MATT: Thankfully, nobody seems to notice Duchess's
presence as Duchess retracts back into your chamber.

2734
02:52:12,047 --> 02:52:13,664
TALIESIN: How flammable is that nest?

2735
02:52:13,664 --> 02:52:14,775
LAURA: I meant it's--

2736
02:52:14,775 --> 02:52:16,078
KHARY: How far is the nest away?

2737
02:52:18,468 --> 02:52:21,451
MATT: It's past 100 feet of tunnel before it opens
up into the chamber, which is another 80 feet from

2738
02:52:21,451 --> 02:52:22,707
the entrance.

2739
02:52:22,707 --> 02:52:24,528
SAM: How big was the chamber?

2740
02:52:24,528 --> 02:52:26,628
LIAM: 80 feet.

2741
02:52:26,628 --> 02:52:27,572
SAM: Oh my god.

2742
02:52:27,572 --> 02:52:29,533
MATT: To give you a visual.

2743
02:52:29,623 --> 02:52:32,603
SAM: A visual? Matt, there's too many maps!

2744
02:52:32,603 --> 02:52:35,420
TALIESIN: (Singing) Too many maps! Too many maps!

2745
02:52:37,490 --> 02:52:39,796
KHARY: Oh look at this thing!

2746
02:52:39,796 --> 02:52:40,749
MATT: So you can prepare.

2747
02:52:40,749 --> 02:52:41,793
SAM: That-- What?!

2748
02:52:41,793 --> 02:52:44,933
SAM: That is upper level shit!

2749
02:52:44,933 --> 02:52:56,236
LAURA: What are we doing? We're level three! What
are we doing? We got to go in, we got to throw

2750
02:52:56,236 --> 02:52:59,525
some dynamite, get the people out, and run!

2751
02:52:59,525 --> 02:53:01,175
KHARY: We got one stick.

2752
02:53:01,195 --> 02:53:02,410
LAURA: We got two sticks!

2753
02:53:02,420 --> 02:53:05,415
TRAVIS: I don't see any support columns. I'm just
going to say it.

2754
02:53:05,415 --> 02:53:10,151
TALIESIN: No, we hit the nest. Set the nest on
fire and it'll run.

2755
02:53:10,151 --> 02:53:15,597
TRAVIS: Yeah. You got to get pretty danger close
to do that, though. I've got to stand up and look,

2756
02:53:15,597 --> 02:53:18,552
make sure there's no damn holes.

2757
02:53:18,552 --> 02:53:21,406
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, good point. Yep!

2758
02:53:21,406 --> 02:53:23,930
MATT: No holes in the chamber from what you can
see.

2759
02:53:23,930 --> 02:53:25,101
TRAVIS: That's the baby, the little thing.

2760
02:53:25,101 --> 02:53:25,624
MATT: Yeah.

2761
02:53:25,624 --> 02:53:28,480
TRAVIS: Okay, no load bearing support columns that
we can see right?

2762
02:53:28,480 --> 02:53:34,715
MATT: Not that you can see, no. There are various
portions in the ceiling that are stalactites. It

2763
02:53:34,715 --> 02:53:37,957
looks like it's the deepest part of the mine,
which is the roughest, which means it does not

2764
02:53:37,957 --> 02:53:41,119
have a lot of support structure built into it for
the miners. This like it's as deep as they got

2765
02:53:41,119 --> 02:53:42,487
before they abandoned it from the veins dried up.

2766
02:53:42,487 --> 02:53:44,609
TRAVIS: Before shit started going wrong?

2767
02:53:44,609 --> 02:53:48,241
MATT: This mine has been long abandoned. The
recent occupants seem to have discovered it, and

2768
02:53:48,241 --> 02:53:49,055
taken it their own.

2769
02:53:55,485 --> 02:54:05,543
KHARY: Well, personally I'm a fan of freedom of
religion, but that's got its limits.

2770
02:54:05,543 --> 02:54:08,721
TALIESIN: It's fair to draw a line at human
sacrifice.

2771
02:54:08,721 --> 02:54:09,497
KHARY: I think so.

2772
02:54:09,497 --> 02:54:10,222
TALIESIN: Yeah. Let's--

2773
02:54:12,492 --> 02:54:16,061
SAM: We can't possibly kill whatever that beast
is.

2774
02:54:16,061 --> 02:54:21,254
LIAM: I don't know, maybe not on our own, two at a
time. I'm pretty tapped, but there's a lot of us

2775
02:54:21,254 --> 02:54:26,227
here and only a few of them there, according to
our new friend.

2776
02:54:26,227 --> 02:54:29,784
SAM: But there's only two survivors in there,
right?

2777
02:54:31,494 --> 02:54:33,906
TRAVIS: Two survivors and two enemies, right?

2778
02:54:33,906 --> 02:54:35,608
MARISHA: Yeah, but what happens if they get
sacrificed?

2779
02:54:35,608 --> 02:54:40,103
SAM: No, I mean, what if we just get the survivors
out and leave?

2780
02:54:40,103 --> 02:54:41,785
MARISHA: I think that's smart.

2781
02:54:41,785 --> 02:54:44,429
KHARY: I tend to agree with my little friend.

2782
02:54:44,429 --> 02:54:46,396
LAURA: And we steal the baby.

2783
02:54:46,396 --> 02:54:50,623
LIAM: We could also try and seal the cave behind
us as we go?

2784
02:54:50,623 --> 02:54:55,791
TALIESIN: Sealing the cave would be one thing, I
think stealing the baby is going to be a bit of a--

2785
02:54:55,791 --> 02:54:59,706
TRAVIS: I love your enthusiasm, but I tend to
agree with Molly here. Maybe the baby just stays put?

2786
02:54:59,706 --> 02:55:03,861
MARISHA: If we can get the baby, I bet it would
fetch a high price.

2787
02:55:03,861 --> 02:55:06,820
SAM: A baby should be with its mother.

2788
02:55:06,820 --> 02:55:10,528
LAURA: Yeah. We might kill the mom though, or bury
it.

2789
02:55:10,528 --> 02:55:13,095
TRAVIS: I think I'm okay with that.

2790
02:55:13,095 --> 02:55:15,636
SAM: As long as they are close to each other.

2791
02:55:15,636 --> 02:55:17,599
TRAVIS: It just ate a Crownsguard in half.

2792
02:55:17,599 --> 02:55:22,696
LAURA: Let's get it out, and then collapse the
tunnel leading to it. Then they can get stuck in

2793
02:55:22,696 --> 02:55:23,490
this room.

2794
02:55:23,490 --> 02:55:24,678
MARISHA: All right.

2795
02:55:24,678 --> 02:55:30,030
LIAM: Could we do a quick inventory check of how
much of these boom sticks that we have, the TNT?

2796
02:55:30,030 --> 02:55:31,997
LAURA: We have one and one.

2797
02:55:31,997 --> 02:55:33,337
KHARY: I have one.

2798
02:55:33,337 --> 02:55:35,625
LIAM: We have more than one? You have one?

2799
02:55:35,625 --> 02:55:36,681
KHARY: I have one.

2800
02:55:36,681 --> 02:55:38,911
LIAM: We have one amongst. Okay.

2801
02:55:42,911 --> 02:55:46,528
LAURA: We should make our way towards this,
though. They're going to get to the next hostage

2802
02:55:46,528 --> 02:55:51,086
by the time we get to this room, cause we're 100
feet away from it still.

2803
02:55:51,086 --> 02:55:53,142
TALIESIN: We make our way.

2804
02:55:53,142 --> 02:55:54,281
LAURA: Start walking.

2805
02:55:54,281 --> 02:55:54,920
TALIESIN: Stealthy walk.

2806
02:55:54,920 --> 02:55:55,170
LAURA: Stealthily.

2807
02:55:55,170 --> 02:55:55,420
MATT: You guys all making an approach?

2808
02:55:55,420 --> 02:55:57,206
SAM: Stealthily.

2809
02:55:57,206 --> 02:56:00,707
MATT: Roll stealth, please.

2810
02:56:00,707 --> 02:56:05,971
LAURA: Who needs a blessing? Caleb, you need a
blessing!

2811
02:56:05,971 --> 02:56:07,454
LIAM: It would help.

2812
02:56:07,454 --> 02:56:08,046
LAURA: You're shitty at stealth right?

2813
02:56:08,046 --> 02:56:10,575
LIAM: I'm pretty shitty at stealth.

2814
02:56:10,575 --> 02:56:11,436
LAURA: I bless you.

2815
02:56:11,436 --> 02:56:12,353
TALIESIN: I'm pretty iffy.

2816
02:56:12,353 --> 02:56:12,603
KHARY: 19!

2817
02:56:12,603 --> 02:56:14,491
LIAM: Plus?

2818
02:56:14,491 --> 02:56:16,613
KHARY: Plus five.

2819
02:56:16,613 --> 02:56:22,515
LIAM: Thank you, Jester, for saving my ass because
the first roll was a four. The second one was a

2820
02:56:22,515 --> 02:56:22,765
15.

2821
02:56:22,765 --> 02:56:23,501
TRAVIS: Are there steps?

2822
02:56:23,501 --> 02:56:23,751
MATT: Yes, right there.

2823
02:56:23,751 --> 02:56:29,312
LAURA: Oh, they're real close to them.

2824
02:56:29,312 --> 02:56:32,762
MATT: All right so, marching order please.

2825
02:56:32,762 --> 02:56:37,156
LIAM and LAURA: I'm in the back!

2826
02:56:37,156 --> 02:56:38,071
SAM: Wait, what's our plan?

2827
02:56:38,071 --> 02:56:42,540
TALIESIN: We're going to make a bunch of noise,
we're going to throw some dynamite, we're going to

2828
02:56:42,540 --> 02:56:45,722
get the kids to run and we're going to keep them
distracted by threatening the baby.

2829
02:56:45,722 --> 02:56:48,465
SAM: That's not a plan.

2830
02:56:48,465 --> 02:56:49,333
TALIESIN: Yes, it is a plan!

2831
02:56:49,333 --> 02:56:51,952
SAM: No, to kill or to capture the--

2832
02:56:51,952 --> 02:56:54,857
LAURA: We get the guards out, we get the people
out.

2833
02:56:54,857 --> 02:56:58,034
SAM: Get the guards out and run? So who are we
leaving back with the sticks?

2834
02:56:58,034 --> 02:57:00,150
LAURA: Oh, we're all going to be in there.

2835
02:57:00,150 --> 02:57:02,062
MATT: What is the marching order?

2836
02:57:02,062 --> 02:57:02,952
TALIESIN: We will throw the sticks.

2837
02:57:02,952 --> 02:57:03,452
MARISHA: I'll go up front with Fjord.

2838
02:57:03,452 --> 02:57:09,249
SAM: No! We should use the sticks to blow up
narrow passage way so they can't get out!

2839
02:57:09,249 --> 02:57:10,464
TALIESIN: Well, we have two sticks.

2840
02:57:10,464 --> 02:57:10,964
SAM: We should use them both!

2841
02:57:10,964 --> 02:57:15,607
TALIESIN: If we run, then we'll drop the sticks.

2842
02:57:15,607 --> 02:57:16,773
MATT: Nott, where are you?

2843
02:57:16,773 --> 02:57:18,497
SAM: I'm in the middle.

2844
02:57:18,497 --> 02:57:19,348
MATT: I'll put you in front of Caleb. Molly, are
you next to Beau?

2845
02:57:19,348 --> 02:57:23,210
TALIESIN: Yeah, anywhere that-- I don't want to be
in the front front, but I'll be in the middle.

2846
02:57:23,210 --> 02:57:24,536
TRAVIS: Who are our two strongest? Jester?

2847
02:57:24,536 --> 02:57:27,473
LIAM: Jester and Beau.

2848
02:57:27,473 --> 02:57:29,600
MARISHA: Well, I'm dexy.

2849
02:57:29,600 --> 02:57:31,874
LIAM: Yeah, you've got dex.

2850
02:57:31,874 --> 02:57:37,874
MARISHA: But I'm not strong. But I'm dextrous. It
depends on what we're talking about. Are we doing

2851
02:57:37,874 --> 02:57:42,704
anything with strength checks? Oh! Dragging people
away? Is that what we're talking about?

2852
02:57:42,704 --> 02:57:44,061
SAM: Are the good guys unconscious?

2853
02:57:44,061 --> 02:57:47,825
MATT: They're conscious, they're just tied up to
each other.

2854
02:57:47,825 --> 02:57:52,148
SAM: Oh. Shit, so two people need to be on drag
duty.

2855
02:57:52,148 --> 02:57:56,110
KHARY: We could cut them free?

2856
02:57:56,110 --> 02:57:59,414
TRAVIS: We're going to have to keep them busy.

2857
02:57:59,414 --> 02:58:06,388
LAURA: You need to sneak in and you need to try to
unhook the ropes, okay?

2858
02:58:06,388 --> 02:58:08,417
SAM: I could try to untie them.

2859
02:58:08,417 --> 02:58:15,057
LAURA: You stealth around. They won't even know
that you're there while we're attacking. Untie the

2860
02:58:15,057 --> 02:58:17,052
guards and then we all run.

2861
02:58:17,052 --> 02:58:32,690
KHARY: Could we distract them with maybe a
Thaumaturgy or Spiritual Weapon?

2862
02:58:32,690 --> 02:58:36,434
LAURA: Spiritual Weapon is really good if you have
that, that's very badass.

2863
02:58:36,434 --> 02:58:38,468
MATT: You can certainly try, it's up to you guys.

2864
02:58:38,468 --> 02:58:45,210
KHARY: I think Spiritual Weapon could make a lot
of noise and call a lot of attention, and then

2865
02:58:45,210 --> 02:58:48,202
maybe you could sneak through.

2866
02:58:48,202 --> 02:58:50,971
TALIESIN: You could do two Spiritual Weapons if
you're feeling it.

2867
02:58:50,971 --> 02:58:56,068
LAURA: I know, but then I have no spells left. I
got a first level, y'all!

2868
02:58:56,068 --> 02:59:00,087
KHARY: I think, because I used Aid, I think I've
got--

2869
02:59:00,087 --> 02:59:04,225
MATT: You have one 2nd-level spell and you have
three 1st-level, I believe.

2870
02:59:04,225 --> 02:59:09,534
KHARY: Yes. No, I've got two 1st-levels, because I
used Thunderwave and Command.

2871
02:59:09,534 --> 02:59:12,103
MATT: That's correct. You have two 1st-levels, you
have three spells left.

2872
02:59:12,103 --> 02:59:23,547
KHARY: Why don't we use-- okay, here's the thing.
If we start with Spiritual Weapon, we lure their

2873
02:59:23,547 --> 02:59:35,876
gaze to this side of the area and then if this
beautiful young lady could find her way around

2874
02:59:35,876 --> 02:59:40,460
the other side to free the two--

2875
02:59:40,460 --> 02:59:43,481
SAM: I can sneak in down to those stalagmites.

2876
02:59:43,481 --> 02:59:44,838
KHARY: Yes.

2877
02:59:44,838 --> 02:59:49,942
LAURA: She should sneak in before you do Spiritual
Weapon, otherwise it's going to make them aware

2878
02:59:49,942 --> 02:59:53,978
that something's going on. The Spiritual Weapon will
definitely alert them to our presence.

2879
02:59:53,978 --> 03:00:00,827
KHARY: The Spiritual Weapon goes off, giving the
people a chance to run out of the place.

2880
03:00:00,827 --> 03:00:06,769
LAURA: Yeah. You make that Spiritual Weapon appear
right next to them. You can hit them immediately.

2881
03:00:06,769 --> 03:00:08,009
KHARY: Right.

2882
03:00:08,009 --> 03:00:11,890
LAURA: You do it right when we do the surprise
attack. You sneak in.

2883
03:00:11,890 --> 03:00:13,830
SAM: Yes.

2884
03:00:13,830 --> 03:00:18,924
MARISHA: The rest of us can be on distraction
duty, yeah? Until we go.

2885
03:00:18,924 --> 03:00:20,143
LAURA: Yeah.

2886
03:00:20,143 --> 03:00:21,420
MARISHA: Nott?

2887
03:00:21,420 --> 03:00:23,219
LAURA: Are you good to sneak? I'm going to bless
you.

2888
03:00:23,219 --> 03:00:24,530
SAM: Okay.

2889
03:00:24,530 --> 03:00:26,533
LAURA: Before you go sneaking around the side.

2890
03:00:26,533 --> 03:00:28,617
SAM: Can I have a ball bearing, please?

2891
03:00:28,617 --> 03:00:31,269
MARISHA: Sure. You can have a few. I hand him a
handful.

2892
03:00:31,269 --> 03:00:33,686
SAM: Thank you.

2893
03:00:33,686 --> 03:00:36,075
MARISHA: Did you just want that because it's
shiny?

2894
03:00:36,075 --> 03:00:37,041
SAM: Yeah.

2895
03:00:37,041 --> 03:00:38,217
MARISHA: Oh, Nott.

2896
03:00:38,217 --> 03:00:40,486
(laughter)

2897
03:00:40,486 --> 03:00:53,664
SAM: I will cast Mage Hand and hold one ball
bearing. I'm getting ready to move stealthily.

2898
03:00:53,664 --> 03:00:56,907
MATT: If I can have all of you who are approaching
to make a stealth check, please.

2899
03:00:56,907 --> 03:00:58,856
LIAM: Also, DM--

2900
03:00:58,856 --> 03:01:00,417
SAM: In addition to the one we just made?

2901
03:01:00,417 --> 03:01:02,978
MATT: Sorry, the one you just made. Sorry, so what
was were those scores?

2902
03:01:02,978 --> 03:01:04,107
SAM: 23.

2903
03:01:04,107 --> 03:01:05,276
MATT: 23.

2904
03:01:05,276 --> 03:01:09,224
LAURA: You get advantage, when you go into the
room, just in case of a natural 20.

2905
03:01:09,224 --> 03:01:14,973
LIAM: I will also say, and I'll do this a lot,
Dancing Lights is in effect behind us. 20 feet

2906
03:01:14,973 --> 03:01:16,499
behind us, waiting.

2907
03:01:16,499 --> 03:01:21,920
MATT: All right. Interesting point of order, this
human that you see, this priest. Pitch black, sees fine.

2908
03:01:21,920 --> 03:01:25,288
LIAM: Sees-- (groans) Okay.

2909
03:01:25,288 --> 03:01:32,627
MATT: Does have a set of, as they've walked into
this chamber-- although you would have seen this.

2910
03:01:32,627 --> 03:01:34,292
LIAM: I did not see that.

2911
03:01:34,292 --> 03:01:39,133
MATT: Actually, yeah. You're the only one who
would notice something. You don't see anything,

2912
03:01:39,133 --> 03:01:42,338
never mind. All right, so--

2913
03:01:42,338 --> 03:01:43,856
KHARY: Say that again.

2914
03:01:43,856 --> 03:01:48,547
MATT: You didn't notice anything in particular,
other than just seeing this scene. Nothing at all.

2915
03:01:48,547 --> 03:01:53,529
You know nothing! So stealth is 23.

2916
03:01:53,529 --> 03:01:55,211
LAURA: 13.

2917
03:01:55,211 --> 03:01:56,157
TALIESIN: Nine.

2918
03:01:56,157 --> 03:01:57,446
TRAVIS: 18.

2919
03:01:57,446 --> 03:01:58,891
MARISHA: 19.

2920
03:01:58,891 --> 03:01:59,880
MATT: All right.

2921
03:01:59,880 --> 03:02:01,162
LIAM: Did you know that you can't see?

2922
03:02:01,162 --> 03:02:02,320
KHARY: I'm blind.

2923
03:02:02,320 --> 03:02:04,182
LAURA: Caleb, what's your stealth roll?

2924
03:02:04,182 --> 03:02:06,034
LIAM: Oh. It was really good. It was a 16 total.

2925
03:02:06,034 --> 03:02:07,791
MATT: 16. What did you roll for stealth check?

2926
03:02:07,791 --> 03:02:09,044
SAM: How do you see things?

2927
03:02:09,044 --> 03:02:10,196
LIAM: The bird.

2928
03:02:10,196 --> 03:02:11,647
KHARY: The bird, baby, the bird.

2929
03:02:11,647 --> 03:02:12,778
LIAM: That's hot.

2930
03:02:12,778 --> 03:02:14,824
MATT: Shakäste, what's your stealth check please?

2931
03:02:14,824 --> 03:02:17,034
KHARY: My stealth check. Oh, my stealth check was
19.

2932
03:02:17,034 --> 03:02:18,191
MATT: 19, okay.

2933
03:02:18,191 --> 03:02:19,458
TALIESIN: I'm the only problem.

2934
03:02:19,458 --> 03:02:22,447
MATT: Yeah, which is good because that means the
rest of the group picked up for you.

2935
03:02:22,447 --> 03:02:24,542
KHARY: That's right, it's 24.

2936
03:02:24,542 --> 03:02:32,055
MATT: As you guys approach, those of you who can
see in the dark, you can't quite see your quarry.

2937
03:02:32,055 --> 03:02:36,034
You'd have to get closer in because I believe it's
a 60 foot darkvision radius for most of you guys.

2938
03:02:36,034 --> 03:02:38,160
Which means you can see to about there.

2939
03:02:38,160 --> 03:02:39,153
LAURA: Okay.

2940
03:02:39,153 --> 03:02:40,177
MARISHA: We suck.

2941
03:02:40,177 --> 03:02:41,605
SAM: I can see the stalagmites?

2942
03:02:41,605 --> 03:02:50,157
KHARY: I believe Anastasia could fly in and hide
behind the stalagmite.

2943
03:02:50,157 --> 03:02:53,374
MATT: You can. Make a stealth check for your
hummingbird.

2944
03:02:53,374 --> 03:02:57,056
LIAM: Come on birdy. Ooh! Good.

2945
03:02:57,056 --> 03:03:00,776
KHARY: All right, 15 plus-- No, I'm sorry.

2946
03:03:00,776 --> 03:03:01,968
LIAM: It's 15.

2947
03:03:01,968 --> 03:03:03,925
KHARY: It's 15 plus five.

2948
03:03:03,925 --> 03:03:08,094
MATT: Natural one and a four on their perception.
Nobody sees your bird's arrival.

2949
03:03:08,094 --> 03:03:09,504
LAURA: Come on, Nott, go.

2950
03:03:09,504 --> 03:03:11,116
SAM: (scampering feet)

2951
03:03:11,116 --> 03:03:13,029
MATT: All right Nott, so you rush in?

2952
03:03:13,029 --> 03:03:15,697
SAM: Yeah. I'm going to-- Mage Hand's already
cast.

2953
03:03:15,697 --> 03:03:17,350
MATT: Yeah, and what's the range on that one?

2954
03:03:17,350 --> 03:03:18,406
SAM: 30 feet.

2955
03:03:18,406 --> 03:03:24,759
MATT: 30 feet, so you can keep it out as far as
that. Yeah, it's fine. All right, so you come in

2956
03:03:24,759 --> 03:03:26,697
there. Where are you holding the ball bearing?

2957
03:03:26,697 --> 03:03:31,472
SAM: I'm going to drop the ball bearing right at
the edge of that stair so it (tings).

2958
03:03:31,472 --> 03:03:36,448
MATT: As that happens, you watch as both the
priest and the large beast at this time-- which

2959
03:03:36,448 --> 03:03:42,469
now that we're getting closer and we're seeing the
form, I probably should've asked this of you

2960
03:03:42,469 --> 03:03:46,522
earlier: go ahead and make a general nature
check.

2961
03:03:46,522 --> 03:03:48,531
SAM: Who me?

2962
03:03:48,531 --> 03:03:50,067
MATT: Both of you guys.

2963
03:03:50,067 --> 03:03:53,436
LIAM: It's alphabetical right on the list. Ooh.

2964
03:03:53,436 --> 03:03:54,780
KHARY: 19.

2965
03:03:54,780 --> 03:03:55,933
LIAM: Plus?

2966
03:03:55,933 --> 03:03:57,166
KHARY: Nature? Plus one.

2967
03:03:57,166 --> 03:03:58,007
SAM: 15.

2968
03:03:58,007 --> 03:03:58,892
KHARY: 20.

2969
03:03:58,892 --> 03:04:03,905
MATT: You notice it, but you, after getting a
closer view of its form as your hummingbird gets

2970
03:04:03,905 --> 03:04:11,860
in close, you can, "I know what this is." This is a
manticore. The wings are scary, the teeth are

2971
03:04:11,860 --> 03:04:14,320
scary, the spines on its tail are scarier.

2972
03:04:14,320 --> 03:04:16,594
KHARY: It has spines in its tail.

2973
03:04:16,594 --> 03:04:23,267
MATT: You've heard rumors of such things being
flung as a weapon and regrown quickly and begin to

2974
03:04:23,267 --> 03:04:31,391
suddenly remember the spines that were affixed to
the armor of the gnoll leader and the glaive. You

2975
03:04:31,391 --> 03:04:37,750
rush in and have this moment of remembrance as you
begin to curl forward, stealthing around the side

2976
03:04:37,750 --> 03:04:42,288
as the ball bearing (ting ting ting). Both the
priest and the manticore whip over in that

2977
03:04:42,288 --> 03:04:49,719
direction. The priest pulls a glove on its hand
that's a dull red color that begins to sparkle

2978
03:04:49,719 --> 03:04:55,159
and glow at the tips of the fingers, and tightens
it on its hand and begins to step down the stairs

2979
03:04:55,159 --> 03:04:57,243
a bit in the direction of that.

2980
03:04:57,243 --> 03:05:00,251
SAM: I'm going behind those stalagmites over
there.

2981
03:05:00,251 --> 03:05:01,277
MATT: Over here?

2982
03:05:01,277 --> 03:05:02,193
SAM: No, like--

2983
03:05:02,193 --> 03:05:03,103
MATT: Over here?

2984
03:05:03,103 --> 03:05:03,815
SAM: Yeah.

2985
03:05:03,815 --> 03:05:04,962
LAURA: All the way around.

2986
03:05:04,962 --> 03:05:10,450
MATT: Okay. Whereas the female manticore,
(flapping). The wind picks up and dust begins

2987
03:05:10,450 --> 03:05:19,517
to spiral and briefly obfuscates the area. The
manticore flies; with an impact, lands on the

2988
03:05:19,517 --> 03:05:33,376
opposite side, right where the ball bearing is and
(sniffs). "Company." All right, what are you guys doing?

2989
03:05:33,376 --> 03:05:37,662
SAM: I'm going straight for the Mage Hand to untie
them.

2990
03:05:37,662 --> 03:05:41,831
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check from a
distance. Well, this would be a straight dexterity

2991
03:05:41,831 --> 03:05:44,161
check. Roll dexterity, not sleight of hand.

2992
03:05:44,161 --> 03:05:45,928
SAM: Dexterity check.

2993
03:05:45,928 --> 03:05:47,750
MATT: Add your dexterity modifier.

2994
03:05:47,750 --> 03:05:49,020
SAM: 18.

2995
03:05:49,020 --> 03:05:56,407
MATT: 18. With a quick, rapid movement of your
Mage Hand, you watch as the ropes on one come

2996
03:05:56,407 --> 03:06:02,049
free. One of them (breathing heavily) looks at
their hands and doesn't know exactly what happened

2997
03:06:02,049 --> 03:06:03,884
but is apparently now free of the ropes.

2998
03:06:03,884 --> 03:06:07,964
LIAM: Are we in a weird in-between combat and
non-combat?

2999
03:06:07,964 --> 03:06:09,717
MATT: Yes. We're not in combat yet, so what are
you guys doing?

3000
03:06:09,717 --> 03:06:14,136
LIAM: I would like to hug the wall and slide along
it. I would like to think I can hear my

3001
03:06:14,136 --> 03:06:20,303
friends breathing-- and stop, yeah that's good--
and hold my action, and if anything comes this way that

3002
03:06:20,303 --> 03:06:26,567
is not my friends to cast Burning Hands as a
tripwire. I'm the tripwire.

3003
03:06:26,567 --> 03:06:27,757
MATT: Within range you mean?

3004
03:06:27,757 --> 03:06:28,947
LIAM: Yeah, of course within range.

3005
03:06:28,947 --> 03:06:31,194
MATT: All righty, anybody else? What are you
preparing for?

3006
03:06:31,194 --> 03:06:33,057
LAURA: Got nothing.

3007
03:06:33,057 --> 03:06:34,595
MARISHA: Waiting to beat face.

3008
03:06:34,595 --> 03:06:36,505
MATT: You're all staying right there?

3009
03:06:36,505 --> 03:06:38,000
TRAVIS: I mean, no.

3010
03:06:38,000 --> 03:06:40,614
MARISHA: Should we creep forward a little? What
should we do?

3011
03:06:40,614 --> 03:06:42,543
TRAVIS: Yeah. We're going to have to fan.

3012
03:06:42,543 --> 03:06:47,001
MARISHA: I guess Fjord and I will take a good ten
feet or so up.

3013
03:06:47,001 --> 03:06:49,195
LAURA: They might see you.

3014
03:06:49,195 --> 03:06:51,027
SAM: Yeah, you're going closer?

3015
03:06:51,027 --> 03:06:52,503
LAURA: You're getting really close to the
manticore.

3016
03:06:52,503 --> 03:06:53,639
SAM: Jesus.

3017
03:06:53,639 --> 03:06:55,966
LIAM: Yeah, maybe the other side of the tunnel so
they don't see you.

3018
03:06:55,966 --> 03:06:58,154
TALIESIN: He's got a distance weapon anyway,
there's really no such thing as a bad--

3019
03:06:58,154 --> 03:07:00,170
LIAM: You can see me doing this.

3020
03:07:00,170 --> 03:07:01,565
MARISHA: Will you put Fjord towards me?

3021
03:07:01,565 --> 03:07:02,586
MATT: Oh, this way?

3022
03:07:02,586 --> 03:07:06,360
LIAM: Yeah, pull him to the other side. They're
seeing me do arcane bullshit on the side while

3023
03:07:06,360 --> 03:07:07,593
sweating.

3024
03:07:07,593 --> 03:07:08,860
MATT: Anybody else preparing?

3025
03:07:08,860 --> 03:07:10,295
LAURA: I'll stand next to Caleb on the inside.

3026
03:07:10,295 --> 03:07:11,448
MATT: All right.

3027
03:07:11,448 --> 03:07:12,534
LAURA: Yeah.

3028
03:07:12,534 --> 03:07:17,485
TALIESIN: I'm really, at this point, only useful
for a couple things. I'm going to keep in the back there.

3029
03:07:17,485 --> 03:07:18,845
MATT: Okay. Shakäste, anything?

3030
03:07:18,845 --> 03:07:22,148
TALIESIN: I got my Vicious Mockery rolling.

3031
03:07:22,148 --> 03:07:28,882
KHARY: I would like for Anastasia to fly to the
other side of the room.

3032
03:07:28,882 --> 03:07:33,326
MATT: Whereabout?

3033
03:07:33,326 --> 03:07:36,707
KHARY: No those stalagmites over-- yeah, there you
go. Hide in those crags over there by the-- that's

3034
03:07:36,707 --> 03:07:41,203
it. Keep a good eye. Good girl.

3035
03:07:41,203 --> 03:07:50,312
MATT: (humming drone) All righty. The manticore
begins to clomp up the steps.

3036
03:07:50,312 --> 03:07:54,311
TRAVIS: Airborne?

3037
03:07:54,311 --> 03:07:59,273
MATT: No, on foot at the moment like (impact
sounds).

3038
03:07:59,273 --> 03:08:02,241
MARISHA: We'll just wait for Nott. Go Nott go.

3039
03:08:02,241 --> 03:08:03,520
KHARY: When do I go?

3040
03:08:03,520 --> 03:08:09,257
MATT: Well, right now as the manticore crests the
top of the stairs, the large, joker-like, toothy

3041
03:08:09,257 --> 03:08:14,066
grin of the female manticore glances up right
towards all of you and goes (growls).

3042
03:08:14,066 --> 03:08:18,165
LIAM: I attack her.

3043
03:08:18,165 --> 03:08:19,823
MATT: It's not within range of you yet.

3044
03:08:19,823 --> 03:08:21,214
LIAM: Not within range? Then I don't do it yet.

3045
03:08:21,214 --> 03:08:24,102
MATT: You're holding it and it's not close enough.
I need you all to roll initiative now.

3046
03:08:24,102 --> 03:08:39,107
LIAM: Wow. My initiative is such dick. All night
long. All campaign long, let's be honest.

3047
03:08:39,107 --> 03:08:40,842
TALIESIN: I did okay.

3048
03:08:40,842 --> 03:08:47,181
LIAM: Oh my gosh. At the end as always.

3049
03:08:47,181 --> 03:08:50,146
MATT: We have 25 to 20 anybody?

3050
03:08:50,146 --> 03:08:51,377
TALIESIN: 22.

3051
03:08:51,377 --> 03:08:52,334
TRAVIS 20.

3052
03:08:52,334 --> 03:08:54,542
MATT: Nice. We have Molly.

3053
03:08:54,542 --> 03:08:56,812
TALIESIN: Are we going to redo the initiative
flags?

3054
03:08:56,812 --> 03:08:59,650
MATT: And Fjord. 20 to 15?

3055
03:08:59,650 --> 03:09:00,893
LAURA: 18.

3056
03:09:00,893 --> 03:09:02,033
SAM: 17.

3057
03:09:02,033 --> 03:09:17,522
MATT: Nice. Jester and Nott. You have Molly,
Fjord, Jester, Nott, and the manticore. Then

3058
03:09:17,522 --> 03:09:21,080
15 to ten?

3059
03:09:21,080 --> 03:09:24,449
KHARY: Pass me Shakäste.

3060
03:09:24,449 --> 03:09:26,054
MATT: Ten to five?

3061
03:09:26,054 --> 03:09:27,579
LIAM: <i>Acht</i>.

3062
03:09:27,579 --> 03:09:34,546
MATT: All righty. We have--

3063
03:09:34,546 --> 03:09:37,615
LIAM: There's people after my eight?

3064
03:09:37,615 --> 03:09:43,484
MATT: Well, simultaneously with the priest.

3065
03:09:43,484 --> 03:09:46,598
KHARY: I am a five.

3066
03:09:46,598 --> 03:09:48,348
MATT: Five (groans).

3067
03:09:48,348 --> 03:09:49,758
MARISHA: I'm a nine.

3068
03:09:49,758 --> 03:09:51,493
MATT: Okay.

3069
03:09:51,493 --> 03:09:53,223
MARISHA: Sorry.

3070
03:09:53,223 --> 03:09:58,025
MATT: It's okay, I got you. At this point, top of
the round: Molly, you're up.

3071
03:09:58,025 --> 03:09:59,557
TRAVIS: I have no idea what the order was.

3072
03:09:59,557 --> 03:10:00,894
TALIESIN: Vicious Mockery.

3073
03:10:00,894 --> 03:10:04,897
MATT: It's Molly, Fjord, Jester, Nott, the
manticore, Beau, then Caleb and the priest

3074
03:10:04,897 --> 03:10:06,634
together, then Shakäste.

3075
03:10:06,634 --> 03:10:09,243
TALIESIN: Vicious Mockery on the manticore.

3076
03:10:09,243 --> 03:10:10,953
MATT: All righty, 12.

3077
03:10:10,953 --> 03:10:14,676
TALIESIN: I don't actually know what it's rolling
against. What is it against?

3078
03:10:14,676 --> 03:10:19,379
MATT: It's eight plus two, which is your
proficiency bonus, which is ten. Plus your wisdom

3079
03:10:19,379 --> 03:10:20,679
modifier. What is your wisdom modifier?

3080
03:10:20,679 --> 03:10:22,198
TALIESIN: My wisdom modifier, I believe it's
three.

3081
03:10:22,198 --> 03:10:23,747
MATT: It would be 13, so it hits, yeah.

3082
03:10:23,747 --> 03:10:30,717
TALIESIN: All right! That's one point of psychic damage
and it has disadvantage on the next attack.

3083
03:10:30,717 --> 03:10:36,466
(rasping) You should leave and protect the child.
Trying to--

3084
03:10:36,466 --> 03:10:42,296
MATT: All right, the female face grins even wider,
the eyes narrow (growls).

3085
03:10:42,296 --> 03:10:43,794
TALIESIN: I'm going to back up.

3086
03:10:43,794 --> 03:10:50,895
MATT: It seems like it shakes its head a bit. It
seems strangely wounded briefly, but then grins at

3087
03:10:50,895 --> 03:10:52,690
the prospect of a new meal.

3088
03:10:52,690 --> 03:10:56,320
TALIESIN: I'm backing up a little bit. I'm going
to step back ten feet.

3089
03:10:56,320 --> 03:11:01,326
MATT: You move back ten feet to there.

3090
03:11:01,326 --> 03:11:02,983
TALIESIN: Yeah, backing up.

3091
03:11:02,983 --> 03:11:09,154
MATT: That brings us to Fjord's turn.

3092
03:11:09,154 --> 03:11:13,097
TRAVIS: Can I move forward and end up right over
there?

3093
03:11:13,097 --> 03:11:15,695
MATT: Right there?

3094
03:11:15,695 --> 03:11:17,856
TRAVIS: Yeah and end up on his flank melee,
please.

3095
03:11:17,856 --> 03:11:18,960
MATT: Put you right there.

3096
03:11:18,960 --> 03:11:22,231
TRAVIS: I will unleash the full fury of my
falchion into his side.

3097
03:11:22,231 --> 03:11:24,484
MATT: With the blade drawn--

3098
03:11:24,484 --> 03:11:25,621
TRAVIS: Two-handed.

3099
03:11:25,621 --> 03:11:34,469
MATT: Right. Shakäste, as you watch, the half-orc,
Fjord, suddenly emerges from his hand out of

3100
03:11:34,469 --> 03:11:39,013
nowhere, this flash of greenish-blue energy and a
splash of water spatters across the ground as a

3101
03:11:39,013 --> 03:11:44,961
slightly curved at the tip falchion appears that
has a cluster of barnacles along the base of it

3102
03:11:44,961 --> 03:11:49,646
and slowly curling up the blade and sea water
dripping off of it at all times leaving a trail of liquid.

3103
03:11:49,646 --> 03:11:53,138
TRAVIS: 23.

3104
03:11:53,138 --> 03:11:54,367
MATT: That hits.

3105
03:11:54,367 --> 03:11:55,381
TALIESIN: Yeah!

3106
03:11:55,381 --> 03:11:58,432
MATT: This thing is pretty big, it's not too hard
to hit comparatively.

3107
03:11:58,432 --> 03:12:02,980
TRAVIS: 13 points of damage. Slashing damage.

3108
03:12:02,980 --> 03:12:04,645
LIAM: What did you roll to hit?

3109
03:12:04,645 --> 03:12:12,846
TRAVIS: The ten, two-handed. That is it.

3110
03:12:12,846 --> 03:12:16,704
MATT: All righty, that ends your turn. It's now
Jester's turn.

3111
03:12:16,704 --> 03:12:23,508
LAURA: I'm going to run around to the other side
of it. This is so dumb.

3112
03:12:23,508 --> 03:12:27,465
MATT: (counting) 30. Are you getting within melee
of it?

3113
03:12:27,465 --> 03:12:28,516
LAURA: Yeah.

3114
03:12:28,516 --> 03:12:29,678
MATT: There you go.

3115
03:12:29,678 --> 03:12:31,663
SAM: Oh my god, are you going to hit it with your
sickle or whatever?

3116
03:12:31,663 --> 03:12:33,426
LAURA: I'm going to hit it with my sickle or
whatever!

3117
03:12:33,426 --> 03:12:34,953
MATT: Roll for attack.

3118
03:12:34,953 --> 03:12:36,042
MARISHA: Do it girl!

3119
03:12:36,042 --> 03:12:38,353
LIAM: Those arrows are long gone.

3120
03:12:38,353 --> 03:12:40,078
LAURA: Natural one!

3121
03:12:40,078 --> 03:12:45,433
MATT: As you rush around the corner, out of the
corner of its eye it sees you. As it spins its

3122
03:12:45,433 --> 03:12:50,056
giant, spined tail which you can see now which
looks like a porcupine filled with javelins.

3123
03:12:50,056 --> 03:12:56,289
Rushes past and slams into your shoulder. As you
do, your sickle flies out of your hand and

3124
03:12:56,289 --> 03:13:00,451
clatters across the ground and hits the floor at
the bottom of the stairs. That is where your

3125
03:13:00,451 --> 03:13:01,475
sickle currently is.

3126
03:13:03,695 --> 03:13:04,724
LAURA: Oh no.

3127
03:13:04,724 --> 03:13:06,416
MATT: End of your turn, Jester?

3128
03:13:06,416 --> 03:13:08,626
TALIESIN: Bonus action, anything?

3129
03:13:08,626 --> 03:13:11,326
TRAVIS: Bonus action to run your ass.

3130
03:13:11,326 --> 03:13:14,526
LAURA: I'm going to just dance in place.

3131
03:13:14,526 --> 03:13:17,219
MATT: All righty. Nott, your turn.

3132
03:13:17,219 --> 03:13:21,413
SAM: Bonus action, use the Mage Hand to untie the
other one.

3133
03:13:21,413 --> 03:13:22,986
MATT: All right, make another dexterity check.

3134
03:13:22,986 --> 03:13:24,902
SAM: 19 plus four.

3135
03:13:24,902 --> 03:13:30,984
MATT: With that the other person's rope falls free
and they're both out of their ropes. They're both

3136
03:13:30,984 --> 03:13:35,500
looking at the only exit that is currently blocked
by this giant manticore creature. They look

3137
03:13:35,500 --> 03:13:38,696
scared and have no idea what's happening. They
haven't seen you. For some reason their ropes have

3138
03:13:38,696 --> 03:13:43,753
dropped and they're scared shitless. They aren't
guards. These two look like civilians and they're

3139
03:13:43,753 --> 03:13:44,995
having a really rough time.

3140
03:13:47,495 --> 03:13:54,569
SAM: (sighs) Should I waste my action on this
shit? I'm still hidden, yeah?

3141
03:13:54,569 --> 03:13:56,404
MATT: As far as you know.

3142
03:13:56,404 --> 03:13:59,386
TALIESIN: There's also another dude.

3143
03:13:59,386 --> 03:14:02,279
SAM: Another dude? Oh, you mean the bad guy.

3144
03:14:02,279 --> 03:14:03,277
MATT: There's the priest.

3145
03:14:03,277 --> 03:14:04,747
SAM: Yeah. Not another good guy.

3146
03:14:04,748 --> 03:14:13,308
SAM: Ah fuck. I'm going to use Message and point
to one of the guards that I just untied.

3147
03:14:13,308 --> 03:14:15,809
MATT: They're not guards, they're civilians.

3148
03:14:15,809 --> 03:14:26,570
SAM: Or whatever, the civilians and say to him:
The second after the priest casts a spell, grab

3149
03:14:26,570 --> 03:14:28,076
your friend and run.

3150
03:14:28,076 --> 03:14:30,159
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

3151
03:14:30,159 --> 03:14:33,158
SAM: Nine.

3152
03:14:33,158 --> 03:14:36,813
MATT: Okay, you deliver the message. That's as far
as you know.

3153
03:14:36,813 --> 03:14:40,496
SAM: Then for my movement I'm going to tuck in
even tighter.

3154
03:14:40,496 --> 03:14:47,832
MATT: Okay. All right that finishes your turn. It
is now the manticore's go. It is going to make

3155
03:14:47,832 --> 03:14:54,509
three attacks, a bite and two claw attacks. It's
going to make two claw attacks. Actually, it's

3156
03:14:54,509 --> 03:14:58,818
going to make one sweeping claw attack at Jester
from behind and then a bite and a claw attack at

3157
03:14:58,818 --> 03:15:01,132
you, since you're right in front of it and already
struck it with your falchion.

3158
03:15:01,132 --> 03:15:02,825
TALIESIN: First one's disadvantage.

3159
03:15:04,485 --> 03:15:10,279
MATT: First one's at disadvantage, which would be
against Jester as you rush past. That is a 17,

3160
03:15:10,279 --> 03:15:11,722
and a 19.

3161
03:15:11,722 --> 03:15:13,432
LAURA: Hits me.

3162
03:15:13,432 --> 03:15:21,488
MATT: Yeah, it hits you, that's without bonuses,
unfortunately. You take from the first strike nine

3163
03:15:21,488 --> 03:15:29,081
points of slashing damage, as it (woosh). It
rolled high, a nine again. Then two strikes

3164
03:15:29,081 --> 03:15:30,292
against you.

3165
03:15:30,292 --> 03:15:34,187
LAURA: I'm going to cast Hellish Rebuke at it as
soon as it does it.

3166
03:15:34,187 --> 03:15:39,865
MATT: Okay, what's the save? It was a natural 20
on you Fjord, unfortunately. The other claw attack.

3167
03:15:41,465 --> 03:15:44,248
TRAVIS: Oh player, I've got the Armor of Agathys
on.

3168
03:15:44,248 --> 03:15:45,411
MARISHA: Oh, that's right!

3169
03:15:45,411 --> 03:15:50,405
LAURA: It doesn't say on my thing. It's a dex
save.

3170
03:15:50,405 --> 03:15:54,879
MATT: A dex save, all right. That is a 12.

3171
03:15:54,879 --> 03:15:55,676
LAURA: Oh!

3172
03:15:55,676 --> 03:15:58,522
MATT: So that hits? All right, go ahead and
roll damage.

3173
03:15:58,522 --> 03:16:00,523
LAURA: 3d10! I'm going to say in Infernal--

3174
03:16:00,523 --> 03:16:02,213
SAM: 3d10?

3175
03:16:02,213 --> 03:16:04,467
LAURA: I'm going to say--

3176
03:16:04,467 --> 03:16:06,520
LIAM: All tens, come on.

3177
03:16:07,890 --> 03:16:09,596
MATT: 2d10.

3178
03:16:09,596 --> 03:16:13,737
LAURA: No, 3d10 because it's cast at 2nd-level
when you're doing Hellish Rebuke.

3179
03:16:13,737 --> 03:16:14,584
MATT: Oh, right, yeah.

3180
03:16:14,584 --> 03:16:19,174
LAURA: Okay, 13.

3181
03:16:19,174 --> 03:16:22,726
MATT: 13 points of damage. Of cold damage.

3182
03:16:22,726 --> 03:16:29,516
LAURA: Yeah, in Infernal I say, Oh, you're such a
cute kitty!

3183
03:16:29,516 --> 03:16:37,115
MATT: With an awkward flick of her wrist, you
watch as this wave of ice spike energy flies

3184
03:16:37,115 --> 03:16:41,291
outward and pierces the side of the manticore's
body as it rotates and breaks the ice off of its

3185
03:16:41,291 --> 03:16:45,785
torso. In doing so, it spins around with its other
claw and strikes right into Fjord with a natural

3186
03:16:45,785 --> 03:16:51,475
20. It rolled a one on the fucking damage die, so
you're fucking lucky on that, that's twice in this

3187
03:16:51,475 --> 03:16:57,225
game. It's kind of disappointing on my end, but
it's fine. So that's five points of slashing damage.

3188
03:16:57,225 --> 03:16:59,609
TRAVIS: And he'll take ten points of cold damage.

3189
03:16:59,609 --> 03:17:00,641
MATT: That's right.

3190
03:17:00,641 --> 03:17:02,223
MARISHA: So. Sick.

3191
03:17:02,223 --> 03:17:04,935
TALIESIN: We're at our best when we're losing.

3192
03:17:04,935 --> 03:17:07,547
MATT: As it strikes with its second claw attack
against you and the ice cracks, and it looks at

3193
03:17:07,547 --> 03:17:14,676
you and the mouth opens wide and you can see where
three separate rows of teeth like this horrible

3194
03:17:14,676 --> 03:17:19,808
shark maw. As it reaches forward to bite towards
you, the head itself about maybe this wide, the

3195
03:17:19,808 --> 03:17:27,520
jaw can almost clamp down onto your waist,
Jurassic Park style. That's going to be a 16 to hit.

3196
03:17:27,520 --> 03:17:28,640
TRAVIS: 16 hits.

3197
03:17:28,640 --> 03:17:29,279
LAURA: Oh no!

3198
03:17:29,279 --> 03:17:30,191
LIAM: Where's your AC?

3199
03:17:30,191 --> 03:17:30,691
TRAVIS: 14.

3200
03:17:30,691 --> 03:17:32,279
LIAM: You're Grog!

3201
03:17:32,279 --> 03:17:32,779
TRAVIS: Nope.

3202
03:17:32,779 --> 03:17:38,488
MATT: That's ten points of piercing damage from
the bite to you.

3203
03:17:38,488 --> 03:17:43,881
TRAVIS: Great, he takes another ten points of cold
damage, as my Armor of--

3204
03:17:43,881 --> 03:17:44,648
MATT: She.

3205
03:17:44,648 --> 03:17:46,499
TRAVIS: She, thank you. As my Armor of Agathys.

3206
03:17:46,499 --> 03:17:50,948
MATT: Interesting, in this quick series of hits,
she's doing fine, but this is an unexpected burst

3207
03:17:50,948 --> 03:17:56,367
of damage and you can see harrying's starting to
show. A powerful creature can do some powerful

3208
03:17:56,367 --> 03:18:07,117
damage, but is showing a little bit of wear and
tear. With that, the manticore is going to take to

3209
03:18:07,117 --> 03:18:08,007
the sky.

3210
03:18:08,007 --> 03:18:10,000
TALIESIN: (singing) Take to the sky!

3211
03:18:11,053 --> 03:18:12,850
MATT: It's going to fly up.

3212
03:18:12,850 --> 03:18:14,849
LAURA: Do we get an attack of opportunity?

3213
03:18:14,849 --> 03:18:16,419
MATT: You both do, yes.

3214
03:18:16,419 --> 03:18:18,615
LAURA: Ah, I'm going to kick it.

3215
03:18:18,615 --> 03:18:19,855
MATT: You can punch it, make an attack.

3216
03:18:19,855 --> 03:18:22,783
LAURA: No, I don't hit it!

3217
03:18:22,783 --> 03:18:25,003
MATT: What did you roll?

3218
03:18:25,003 --> 03:18:26,497
LAURA: I rolled a three!

3219
03:18:26,497 --> 03:18:28,124
TRAVIS: Do I get an attack?

3220
03:18:28,124 --> 03:18:30,618
MATT: You do, yes.

3221
03:18:30,618 --> 03:18:35,076
TRAVIS: I don't think that's going to hit either,
that's an eight.

3222
03:18:35,076 --> 03:18:38,536
MATT: Nope, you both, (whoosh). The giant gust of
wind from the wings flapping push you away and you

3223
03:18:38,536 --> 03:18:44,544
have to block your vision to keep the dust out of
the way. Finishing the manticore's turn, it is now

3224
03:18:44,544 --> 03:18:46,569
Beau's go.

3225
03:18:46,569 --> 03:18:49,699
MARISHA: Okay, well it took off flying, so that
sucks.

3226
03:18:49,699 --> 03:18:51,568
LIAM: You can't even see it.

3227
03:18:51,568 --> 03:18:57,400
MARISHA: I feel kind of like Grog. what can I do
with that?

3228
03:18:57,400 --> 03:19:00,221
TRAVIS: Welcome to my fucking three years.

3229
03:19:00,221 --> 03:19:10,274
MARISHA: Yeah, that's lame. I don't know what to
do. I'll move forward and hold my action for light.

3230
03:19:10,274 --> 03:19:14,003
MATT: How far are you going to move forward? 20
feet?

3231
03:19:14,003 --> 03:19:18,087
MARISHA: Oh, where's the priest? But I can't see
the priest, it's dark in here.

3232
03:19:18,087 --> 03:19:25,185
MATT: You're seeing faint flashes of light.
Actually, you don't see any light, because no

3233
03:19:25,185 --> 03:19:28,648
one's cast any spells, it's all been combat, so
it's just darkness and you hear roars and slams

3234
03:19:28,648 --> 03:19:31,757
and impacts. You're like, (worried noise).

3235
03:19:31,757 --> 03:19:40,551
MARISHA: I'm going to move behind Jester, and I'll
just dodge as my action, there's not a lot I can do.

3236
03:19:41,000 --> 03:19:45,353
MATT: Okay, that finishes your turn, Caleb and the
priest are going simultaneously. What are you doing?

3237
03:19:45,603 --> 03:19:49,716
LIAM: So this has happened like six times now,
where I go right after Beau, so Dancing Lights,

3238
03:19:49,716 --> 03:19:50,825
excuse me.

3239
03:19:50,825 --> 03:19:53,624
MATT: Well first off, the spell you prepared,
never went off, so the spell is gone, it's used.

3240
03:19:53,624 --> 03:19:55,534
LIAM: Of course.

3241
03:19:55,534 --> 03:19:57,141
MATT: So the spell's gone, so you lose one of
those.

3242
03:19:57,141 --> 03:20:02,751
LIAM: So instead, Dancing Light. I'm going to do
the same line of light that I always do because

3243
03:20:02,751 --> 03:20:11,556
Beauregard needs to be able to kill things and
see. One goes far as here, and here, and here probably.

3244
03:20:11,562 --> 03:20:13,929
MATT: You have enough to generally light most of
the chamber.

3245
03:20:13,929 --> 03:20:15,772
LIAM: It's always a line spread out.

3246
03:20:15,772 --> 03:20:17,281
MATT: Perfect. That's your action?

3247
03:20:17,281 --> 03:20:24,755
LIAM: No, I'm also going to back up about 15 feet
as well. Then I'm going to crouch because I'm frightened.

3248
03:20:24,755 --> 03:20:35,108
MATT: Okay. That comes to the priest's turn. The
priest is going to step forward angrily, and is

3249
03:20:35,108 --> 03:20:39,610
going to attempt to cast Hold Person on you.

3250
03:20:41,450 --> 03:20:47,302
SAM: Joke's on him, that's not a person. It's a
half-orc.

3251
03:20:47,302 --> 03:20:52,683
MATT: Half-orcs are people too, Sam. Make a wisdom
saving throw.

3252
03:20:52,683 --> 03:20:58,279
TRAVIS: Wisdom saving throw. Big modifier of
nothing. Six.

3253
03:20:58,279 --> 03:21:06,864
MATT: With that, you feel your muscles lock up,
your entire body freezes in place as you feel your

3254
03:21:06,864 --> 03:21:10,943
entire physical self lock up, unable to move.

3255
03:21:10,943 --> 03:21:13,208
LIAM: He done been bifurcated.

3256
03:21:13,208 --> 03:21:15,410
LAURA: He done been paralyzed.

3257
03:21:15,410 --> 03:21:21,325
MATT: All right. The priest is going to go ahead
and take two steps back after casting that, and

3258
03:21:21,325 --> 03:21:22,230
hide behind--

3259
03:21:22,230 --> 03:21:23,374
LAURA: (singing) Two steps forward--

3260
03:21:23,374 --> 03:21:24,742
ALL: (singing) Two steps back.

3261
03:21:26,522 --> 03:21:30,875
MATT: Caleb, that finishes your turn as well.
Shakäste, you're up.

3262
03:21:32,475 --> 03:21:35,516
KHARY: Let's see, we don't need light anymore.

3263
03:21:35,516 --> 03:21:36,574
LIAM: Save us.

3264
03:21:36,574 --> 03:21:45,361
KHARY: I think we need a bigger mode of damage. I
think rather than Spiritual Weapon, we need to go

3265
03:21:45,361 --> 03:21:47,734
with the Thunderwave again.

3266
03:21:47,734 --> 03:21:49,098
LAURA: Oh, the spell.

3267
03:21:49,098 --> 03:21:50,994
LIAM: That's a very short range, though.

3268
03:21:50,994 --> 03:21:52,483
MATT: Yeah, it's a 15-foot square.

3269
03:21:52,483 --> 03:21:55,529
LIAM: You can't get close enough to anybody on
that map to use it.

3270
03:21:55,529 --> 03:21:59,125
MATT: Yeah, the manticore is about 15 feet up in
the air right now, so it's just out of the range.

3271
03:21:59,125 --> 03:22:00,153
KHARY: Ah, so I can't get to it.

3272
03:22:00,153 --> 03:22:03,548
LAURA: Spiritual Weapon stays on the field. Once
you cast it, it's out there in every single turn,

3273
03:22:03,548 --> 03:22:05,359
for a bonus action you can attack.

3274
03:22:05,359 --> 03:22:11,139
MATT: I will say, Spiritual Weapon, as far as I
know-- let me see here real fast. It's pretty

3275
03:22:11,139 --> 03:22:12,204
great.

3276
03:22:12,204 --> 03:22:15,618
LIAM: Do you have a level one left?

3277
03:22:15,618 --> 03:22:17,578
KHARY: I do have a level one.

3278
03:22:17,578 --> 03:22:23,044
MATT: It says a floating spectral creature, it
doesn't specify if that it can or cannot move up

3279
03:22:23,044 --> 03:22:25,522
and down, so I would imagine you could create it
in the air if you want.

3280
03:22:25,522 --> 03:22:28,994
LIAM: I think these are your best options: either
a floating weapon that can go anywhere, or a big

3281
03:22:28,994 --> 03:22:34,155
fog cloud, if you run up and put it on the priest,
or up there. I think probably Spiritual Weapon.

3282
03:22:34,155 --> 03:22:37,776
KHARY: I think Spiritual Weapon because the thing
is, is that I can move it from one to the other.

3283
03:22:37,776 --> 03:22:39,789
LIAM: You can adjust.

3284
03:22:39,789 --> 03:22:41,657
KHARY: Spiritual Weapon.

3285
03:22:41,657 --> 03:22:43,220
MATT: Do you move forward to cast it?

3286
03:22:43,220 --> 03:22:48,827
KHARY: Yes, let's see, I will stay in the
hallway.

3287
03:22:48,827 --> 03:22:50,666
MATT: How far, there?

3288
03:22:50,666 --> 03:22:52,276
KHARY: Yeah, right about there.

3289
03:22:52,276 --> 03:22:55,635
MATT: You're creating it at the base of the
manticore, or further in the chamber, or where?

3290
03:22:55,635 --> 03:23:00,225
KHARY: Oh, I would love to drum the underside of
her.

3291
03:23:00,225 --> 03:23:03,554
MATT: Easily enough to do. What kind of weapon do
you create?

3292
03:23:03,554 --> 03:23:06,986
LIAM: Decide what it is. A lollipop, a salmon, a
sword?

3293
03:23:06,986 --> 03:23:08,785
LAURA: Don't give-- Let him decide.

3294
03:23:08,785 --> 03:23:13,470
MATT: What magical, mystical weapon would you like
to create that represents your attack on this

3295
03:23:13,470 --> 03:23:14,550
creature?

3296
03:23:14,550 --> 03:23:15,943
LIAM: Nunchucks.

3297
03:23:15,943 --> 03:23:19,801
KHARY: I would--

3298
03:23:19,801 --> 03:23:21,557
LIAM: Have fun.

3299
03:23:21,557 --> 03:23:32,496
KHARY: (laughs) The first thing that I was
thinking, for some reason, was I would like to

3300
03:23:32,496 --> 03:23:42,578
materialize the awe-inspiring sass of Estelle
Getty, and pummel the stomach--

3301
03:23:42,578 --> 03:23:43,371
TALIESIN: Oh man.

3302
03:23:43,371 --> 03:23:45,755
TRAVIS: What the fuck.

3303
03:23:45,755 --> 03:23:50,671
KHARY: That's all right. That might be a little
bit too out there, so--

3304
03:23:50,671 --> 03:23:52,078
TRAVIS: It's not.

3305
03:23:52,078 --> 03:23:52,855
MATT: What do you want to do?

3306
03:23:52,855 --> 03:23:57,504
LIAM: It could be a cudgel carved to look like
Estelle Getty if you wanted it to be.

3307
03:23:57,504 --> 03:24:07,987
KHARY: You know what? The sassiest of the Golden
Girls-- I think because my lovely daughter,

3308
03:24:07,987 --> 03:24:15,328
literally-- It was 120 days into the school year,
and she dressed like a 120-year-old woman today,

3309
03:24:15,328 --> 03:24:26,810
my six-year-old daughter. I think that the bust of
a tiny curly-headed 120-year-old woman needs to

3310
03:24:26,810 --> 03:24:31,450
slam its way into the torso of that manticore.

3311
03:24:31,450 --> 03:24:32,518
LIAM: Like a Beethoven bust, but Estelle Getty!

3312
03:24:32,518 --> 03:24:41,537
MATT: Estelle Getty begins to bludgeon itself into
this creature. I love it.

3313
03:24:41,537 --> 03:24:46,166
KHARY: Into that thing right there. That's right.
Mya, you should be in bed, but this is for you,

3314
03:24:46,166 --> 03:24:46,688
baby.

3315
03:24:46,688 --> 03:24:51,447
MATT: Go ahead and roll a melee spell attack. Roll
that and add five to it.

3316
03:24:51,447 --> 03:24:56,402
KHARY: 13. 18.

3317
03:24:56,402 --> 03:25:00,863
MATT: That hits. Roll the damage on that one. It
is 1d8 plus three.

3318
03:25:00,863 --> 03:25:02,307
LIAM: That's the d8, yeah.

3319
03:25:02,307 --> 03:25:04,919
MATT: Roll that and add three.

3320
03:25:04,919 --> 03:25:07,447
KHARY: Ah! One.

3321
03:25:07,447 --> 03:25:11,031
MATT: Still, four points of damage. Nothing to
scoff at, and it's still out there without concentration.

3322
03:25:11,281 --> 03:25:11,783
LIAM: That's true.

3323
03:25:11,783 --> 03:25:15,470
MATT: Do you want to move anywhere, or you going
to stay put?

3324
03:25:15,470 --> 03:25:19,487
KHARY: Let's see. I am going to remain where I
am.

3325
03:25:19,487 --> 03:25:22,240
MATT: Good to know. Finishing that, top of the
round. Molly, you're up.

3326
03:25:22,240 --> 03:25:31,024
TALIESIN: Again, there's not much I can do-- I'm
going to step in front of Caleb, in an attempt to

3327
03:25:31,024 --> 03:25:33,968
be another target, and I'm going to try again with
Vicious Mockery.

3328
03:25:33,968 --> 03:25:35,038
MATT: All righty.

3329
03:25:35,038 --> 03:25:38,384
LIAM: Thank you for being a friend.

3330
03:25:38,384 --> 03:25:41,309
MATT: A two. It does not succeed.

3331
03:25:41,309 --> 03:25:45,898
TALIESIN: Yeah. (rasping) You are going to be
buried here! I hit him again. Four points of

3332
03:25:45,898 --> 03:25:46,388
psychic damage.

3333
03:25:46,388 --> 03:25:49,209
MATT: All right, four points of psychic damage,
and first attack has disadvantage.

3334
03:25:49,209 --> 03:25:54,574
TALIESIN: First attack has disadvantage. I'm going
to be in front of Caleb.

3335
03:25:54,574 --> 03:25:57,220
MATT: Cool, sounds good. That's the end of your
turn, Molly. Fjord, you're up.

3336
03:25:57,220 --> 03:26:01,257
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm up? I'm a Hold Person!

3337
03:26:01,257 --> 03:26:04,538
MATT: Yep, so roll a wisdom saving throw to see if
you can resist it.

3338
03:26:04,538 --> 03:26:05,246
TRAVIS: Nope!

3339
03:26:05,246 --> 03:26:08,507
MATT: Nope, you're still locked in place.

3340
03:26:08,507 --> 03:26:10,087
TRAVIS: Fuck that die.

3341
03:26:10,087 --> 03:26:13,277
LAURA: Can you do anything while you're
paralyzed?

3342
03:26:13,277 --> 03:26:17,114
MATT: Nope. Nothing. That ends Fjord's turn.
Jester, you're up.

3343
03:26:17,114 --> 03:26:25,690
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to Sacred Flame the priest.

3344
03:26:25,690 --> 03:26:29,445
MATT: Okay. Is it a wisdom saving throw?

3345
03:26:29,445 --> 03:26:33,036
LAURA: Sacred Flame is a dexterity saving throw.

3346
03:26:33,036 --> 03:26:35,677
MATT: Dexterity save. That is a ten.

3347
03:26:35,677 --> 03:26:37,014
LAURA: Yeah!

3348
03:26:37,014 --> 03:26:39,517
MATT: 12, sorry.

3349
03:26:39,517 --> 03:26:43,432
LAURA: Doesn't matter! Still hit! Six damage of
radiant.

3350
03:26:43,432 --> 03:26:48,310
MATT: Six damage of radiant. As it's right
behind-- it's trying to block around the pillar,

3351
03:26:48,310 --> 03:26:52,581
but you still have a clear visual as you
concentrate on the symbol of the Traveler hidden

3352
03:26:52,581 --> 03:26:56,484
beneath your outfit. You focus and there's a burst
of energy that burns around its body--

3353
03:26:56,484 --> 03:26:57,405
LAURA: <i>Pink</i> energy.

3354
03:26:57,405 --> 03:26:59,674
MATT: Pink energy that sparkles around him as he
looks over towards you and he continues to try and

3355
03:26:59,674 --> 03:27:01,396
crouch behind the stalagmite.

3356
03:27:01,396 --> 03:27:02,667
LAURA: Is Hold Person concentration?

3357
03:27:02,667 --> 03:27:17,807
MATT: It is, so he has to make a concentration
check. Which he fails? That's an 11? No, it's a

3358
03:27:17,807 --> 03:27:22,459
ten. No, it succeeds. Just barely succeeds. The DC
is ten. Sorry! He rolled a nine, but he has a plus

3359
03:27:22,459 --> 03:27:24,234
one constitution. Sorry.

3360
03:27:24,234 --> 03:27:25,802
TALIESIN: That's ten.

3361
03:27:25,802 --> 03:27:30,172
MATT: Yeah, he succeeded. He has to meet the DC or
higher. But good try.

3362
03:27:30,172 --> 03:27:31,362
TALIESIN: You still have movement, too.

3363
03:27:31,362 --> 03:27:32,968
LAURA: Oh, I can move.

3364
03:27:32,968 --> 03:27:33,468
MATT: Yes, you can.

3365
03:27:35,448 --> 03:27:36,974
TALIESIN: You could go get your sickle.

3366
03:27:36,974 --> 03:27:38,450
LAURA: Oh yeah, that's right! I could run down and
grab my sickle, why not?

3367
03:27:38,450 --> 03:27:45,536
SAM: Wait, so the boys didn't get up and run as
soon as the priest made his move?

3368
03:27:45,536 --> 03:27:47,961
MATT: No, not yet, unfortunately.

3369
03:27:47,961 --> 03:27:49,851
SAM: They're just lying there?

3370
03:27:49,851 --> 03:27:52,884
MATT: Well, they're coming around for their turn.

3371
03:27:52,884 --> 03:27:54,601
LAURA: Oh, that's right. They can't just move.

3372
03:27:54,601 --> 03:27:55,973
MARISHA: Save yourself!

3373
03:27:55,973 --> 03:28:03,603
TALIESIN: This is why you don't plan, Sam! This is
why we don't plan! Because plans go wrong.

3374
03:28:03,603 --> 03:28:06,652
MATT: You have your sickle, you still have more
movement if you wanted to move. You have ten more

3375
03:28:06,652 --> 03:28:07,123
feet. Or 15 more feet.

3376
03:28:07,123 --> 03:28:12,610
LAURA: I'm going to run up and engage the priest.

3377
03:28:12,610 --> 03:28:18,572
MATT: All right. You're right up in his face. That
ends your turn. Nott, you're up.

3378
03:28:18,572 --> 03:28:19,552
SAM: What to do?

3379
03:28:19,552 --> 03:28:22,892
MATT: Gnollish priest. Regular gnoll, regular
gnoll.

3380
03:28:22,892 --> 03:28:34,137
SAM: I will run right past those two guards. As I
go by, I say: Get the fuck out of here!

3381
03:28:34,137 --> 03:28:38,584
(laughter)

3382
03:28:38,584 --> 03:28:45,473
MATT: They watch as a tiny goblin with jagged
teeth yells at them as they run by. However, there

3383
03:28:45,473 --> 03:28:48,528
are more scary things in the current vicinity. You
rush past, and they're two civilians, not guards,

3384
03:28:48,528 --> 03:28:49,888
but continue.

3385
03:28:49,888 --> 03:28:52,897
SAM: Oh, sorry. No, I'm going to keep calling them
guards.

3386
03:28:52,897 --> 03:28:57,271
MATT: I'm okay with that. They're guards from your
perspective. All right, so you run past.

3387
03:28:57,271 --> 03:29:00,930
SAM: Bonus action dash up the steps.

3388
03:29:00,930 --> 03:29:02,088
TALIESIN: Are you going to go for it?

3389
03:29:02,088 --> 03:29:03,112
LAURA: Get the baby.

3390
03:29:03,112 --> 03:29:04,636
MARISHA: Oh my god, are you going for it?

3391
03:29:04,636 --> 03:29:08,553
SAM: I'm going to turn around and yell at the
manticore--

3392
03:29:08,553 --> 03:29:09,335
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Oh no!

3393
03:29:09,335 --> 03:29:09,835
MARISHA: Nott the Brave!

3394
03:29:09,835 --> 03:29:19,773
SAM: You want to save this thing? I will slice
down with my short sword on the baby.

3395
03:29:19,773 --> 03:29:22,075
MATT: Make an attack roll.

3396
03:29:23,525 --> 03:29:24,525
SAM: Ooh. I mean, 14?

3397
03:29:24,525 --> 03:29:29,777
MATT: It hits it. It's a <i>baby.</i> Roll damage.

3398
03:29:29,777 --> 03:29:31,555
LIAM: Nott's going to die!

3399
03:29:31,555 --> 03:29:32,327
SAM: Eight.

3400
03:29:32,327 --> 03:29:35,507
MATT: It's helpless, it's sneak attack.

3401
03:29:35,507 --> 03:29:41,442
MATT: It can't do anything. It can't defend
itself. Its <i>eyes</i> aren't open!

3402
03:29:41,442 --> 03:29:49,535
SAM: It's 16. 2d6. No sorry, 17 damage.

3403
03:29:49,535 --> 03:29:58,485
MATT: As you plunge your short sword down into the
mewling, eye-covered cub, it goes still, as the

3404
03:29:58,485 --> 03:30:03,694
mother manticore flying up in the air turns around
to watch this, and gives a (roar)!

3405
03:30:03,694 --> 03:30:07,655
SAM: (screaming) Get the fuck out of here!

3406
03:30:07,655 --> 03:30:11,630
ALL: Oh my god!

3407
03:30:11,630 --> 03:30:13,539
TALIESIN: I take it back! Plan!

3408
03:30:15,499 --> 03:30:20,485
MATT: Nott, that ends your turn? It's the
manticore's turn. The manticore, which was about

3409
03:30:20,485 --> 03:30:26,525
to unleash a triple round of attacks against a
paralyzed Fjord, who, while paralyzed, would have

3410
03:30:26,525 --> 03:30:32,746
all been criticals, strangely saved him and is
instead going to dart--

3411
03:30:32,746 --> 03:30:35,398
LAURA: Does the Spiritual Weapon get a--

3412
03:30:35,398 --> 03:30:41,168
MATT: It does not, no. At a 50-foot fly speed,
land right next to you, Nott, and take a full

3413
03:30:41,168 --> 03:30:47,480
round of strikes against you. Too angry to worry
about tail spines at this point, it's going all

3414
03:30:47,480 --> 03:30:49,976
in, physical assault to whatever just murdered its
baby.

3415
03:30:49,976 --> 03:30:51,106
TALIESIN: Disadvantage!

3416
03:30:51,106 --> 03:30:56,053
MATT: Disadvantage on the first strike. 17 and a
natural one.

3417
03:30:56,053 --> 03:30:58,816
SAM: Miss!

3418
03:30:58,816 --> 03:31:03,596
MATT: Which, I'll say, causes it to strike down
towards you in fury, and instead its claw gets

3419
03:31:03,596 --> 03:31:07,546
jammed into the ground, so it gets disadvantage on
its second attack. I'm trying to play with natural

3420
03:31:07,546 --> 03:31:15,406
ones a little more in this campaign. This is the
second claw attack against you. A natural 20 and a

3421
03:31:15,406 --> 03:31:18,495
17. It hits but it avoids the critical, which is
good.

3422
03:31:18,495 --> 03:31:19,604
LAURA: Oh my god.

3423
03:31:19,604 --> 03:31:25,636
MATT: That is nine points of slashing damage with
the claw.

3424
03:31:25,636 --> 03:31:26,651
TALIESIN: Are you all right?

3425
03:31:26,651 --> 03:31:27,341
SAM: So far.

3426
03:31:27,341 --> 03:31:30,745
MATT: Then the bite attack is going to come
towards you. I'm going to give this advantage

3427
03:31:30,745 --> 03:31:32,735
because you just killed its baby.

3428
03:31:32,735 --> 03:31:36,485
TRAVIS: Because you killed its baby!

3429
03:31:36,485 --> 03:31:39,574
MATT: Yeah, that's going to be a 21.

3430
03:31:39,574 --> 03:31:41,438
SAM: Sure, that hits.

3431
03:31:41,438 --> 03:31:46,481
MATT: All righty. There we go, there's the actual
damage die roll. That's 11 points of piercing damage.

3432
03:31:46,481 --> 03:31:47,541
LAURA: (gasp)

3433
03:31:47,541 --> 03:31:48,901
LIAM: Are you up?

3434
03:31:48,901 --> 03:31:49,751
SAM: (whispers) One point.

3435
03:31:49,751 --> 03:31:50,986
MATT: Oh shit!

3436
03:31:50,986 --> 03:31:54,116
(laughter and gasping)

3437
03:31:54,116 --> 03:31:56,387
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Oh, fuck.

3438
03:31:56,387 --> 03:31:59,037
MATT: That ends the manticore's turn. The
civilians get up--

3439
03:31:59,037 --> 03:32:02,477
SAM: Yeah, leave, motherfuckers! Leave!

3440
03:32:02,487 --> 03:32:08,516
MATT: And begin to run. (counting) They get that
far with the movement and dash. They're (gasping)

3441
03:32:08,516 --> 03:32:13,144
tripping and falling, managing to make their way
there. They're both frightened, covered in all

3442
03:32:13,144 --> 03:32:17,851
sorts of dirt and gore, and running in your
direction, trying to get away from whatever's

3443
03:32:17,851 --> 03:32:23,696
happening back there. The roar set a further fire
in them. All right. Beau, you're up.

3444
03:32:23,696 --> 03:32:24,721
MARISHA: (moans)

3445
03:32:24,721 --> 03:32:27,652
SAM: She's got to grab Fjord!

3446
03:32:28,043 --> 03:32:29,508
LAURA: Grab Fjord and get out of here.

3447
03:32:29,508 --> 03:32:32,468
LIAM: Fjord? Nott! Nott's in danger!

3448
03:32:32,468 --> 03:32:34,720
LAURA: I know, I'm going to cast-- I'm going to
cure you.

3449
03:32:34,720 --> 03:32:39,318
MARISHA: Okay. How far away is Nott from me?

3450
03:32:39,318 --> 03:32:43,759
MATT: Nott is 40 feet from you.

3451
03:32:43,759 --> 03:32:45,749
TRAVIS: Or hit the fucking manticore. You got to
unfreeze me, too.

3452
03:32:45,749 --> 03:32:56,429
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to yell at Nott, I'm
going to be like: Nott, the fuck?! Then I'm going

3453
03:32:56,429 --> 03:33:02,204
to take off in a full sprint towards Nott.

3454
03:33:02,204 --> 03:33:08,402
MATT: (counting) You can get right up to the top
of the steps.

3455
03:33:08,402 --> 03:33:14,496
MARISHA: I'm going to go: the fuck?! I grab you
again, and I scoop up Nott, and like a football

3456
03:33:14,496 --> 03:33:20,142
drill, I dart, and then I'm going to dart all the
way back with Nott. Carrying Nott like a football.

3457
03:33:20,142 --> 03:33:22,681
SAM: You're going to get the hit. With me, too.

3458
03:33:22,681 --> 03:33:28,974
MATT: Okay. You scoop up Nott. That means, because
you're carrying another creature, your movement is

3459
03:33:28,974 --> 03:33:32,895
halved when you run. Are you using-- it's your
action to grab and pick him up.

3460
03:33:32,895 --> 03:33:37,329
MARISHA: Okay. I want to use my Step of the Wind.
Ki point.

3461
03:33:37,329 --> 03:33:43,401
MATT: Ki point, Step of the Wind to run. That
moves you and Nott 20 feet. You get Nott to there.

3462
03:33:43,401 --> 03:33:46,563
The manticore is going to take an attack of
opportunity against Nott.

3463
03:33:46,563 --> 03:33:48,744
MARISHA: Ah, damn it! I was hoping it would be on
me!

3464
03:33:48,744 --> 03:33:52,607
MATT: Of course! The creature doesn't give a shit
about anybody but that little goblin that stabbed

3465
03:33:52,607 --> 03:33:53,363
its baby.

3466
03:33:53,363 --> 03:33:57,542
KHARY: You are like holding her and covering her,
aren't you?

3467
03:33:57,542 --> 03:33:58,883
MATT: That is 19 to hit.

3468
03:33:58,883 --> 03:33:59,854
SAM: Yeah, that hits.

3469
03:34:01,654 --> 03:34:05,567
MATT: A bite strike again, that is ten points of
piercing damage.

3470
03:34:05,567 --> 03:34:06,727
SAM: (scream)

3471
03:34:06,727 --> 03:34:08,182
LAURA: Unconscious.

3472
03:34:08,182 --> 03:34:12,987
MATT: As you pull Nott away, there's a sudden tug,
and you pull hard and you look back and you watch

3473
03:34:12,987 --> 03:34:19,134
as you drag Nott out of the teeth of it, grinding
across the body, dragging wounds like daggers

3474
03:34:19,134 --> 03:34:24,147
across Nott's face and chest. You see blood pour
out of each of these scars.

3475
03:34:24,147 --> 03:34:26,038
MARISHA: The fuck?! I still run.

3476
03:34:26,038 --> 03:34:29,310
MATT: All right, so you are unconscious and
bleeding out.

3477
03:34:29,310 --> 03:34:32,143
MARISHA: I don't have a bonus or anything, right?
That was everything?

3478
03:34:32,143 --> 03:34:36,241
MATT: Nope, that's your whole turn. You used
everything for that. End of Beau's turn. Caleb and

3479
03:34:36,241 --> 03:34:37,322
the priest are up.

3480
03:34:37,322 --> 03:34:42,746
LIAM: I saw that, and I walk as far forward as I
can with my movement and start stirring the pot on

3481
03:34:42,746 --> 03:34:50,182
Chromatic Orb. I have one left. I will use ice
damage and I will send it out and I knock it off

3482
03:34:50,182 --> 03:34:53,839
my hand towards the manticore. Come on, please.

3483
03:34:53,839 --> 03:34:56,707
SAM: The sticks! The dynamite sticks!

3484
03:34:56,707 --> 03:34:59,032
LIAM: That's a 25.

3485
03:34:59,032 --> 03:35:01,108
MATT: 25 hits. Roll damage.

3486
03:35:01,108 --> 03:35:14,691
LIAM: That is 3d8 cold damage. That is-- ooh! 15
total.

3487
03:35:14,691 --> 03:35:16,080
MATT: 15 points of cold damage. Nice.

3488
03:35:16,080 --> 03:35:16,909
LIAM: I would have gone as far forward as I can.

3489
03:35:16,909 --> 03:35:21,973
MATT: You moved up there. It strikes the
manticore, a burst of ice that freezes part of the

3490
03:35:21,973 --> 03:35:28,432
side of the mane and the fur on its body before
the fur cracks and the flesh that it impacted

3491
03:35:28,432 --> 03:35:29,810
cracks. There's a little bit of muscle exposed
beneath the wound left behind from the frost

3492
03:35:29,810 --> 03:35:30,572
freeze you left on the side of its torso.

3493
03:35:30,572 --> 03:35:38,586
LIAM: Caleb is breathing very heavily and not
looking at the manticore. He's looking at Nott in

3494
03:35:38,586 --> 03:35:39,615
Beauregard's arms.

3495
03:35:39,615 --> 03:35:45,403
MATT: That ends your turn. The priest, who is
currently working on that, going to maintain Hold

3496
03:35:45,403 --> 03:35:55,036
Person, is going to step up. No, it's going to--
yeah, because you're right there in front, it's

3497
03:35:55,036 --> 03:35:56,160
going to Inflict Wounds on you.

3498
03:35:56,160 --> 03:35:56,410
LIAM and MARISHA: Ooh!

3499
03:35:56,410 --> 03:35:56,660
SAM: No problem.

3500
03:35:56,660 --> 03:36:10,884
MATT: A melee spell attack. Not great. Actually,
not bad! That's a 17.

3501
03:36:10,884 --> 03:36:11,670
LAURA: 17.

3502
03:36:11,670 --> 03:36:16,680
MATT: That is your armor class. 17 hits. You take
3d10 points of necrotic damage.

3503
03:36:16,680 --> 03:36:20,503
LIAM: Oh! Necrotic! Necrotic just follows Laura
Bailey.

3504
03:36:20,503 --> 03:36:21,499
MATT: I know.

3505
03:36:21,499 --> 03:36:21,999
SAM: It will be like a 12.

3506
03:36:21,999 --> 03:36:23,088
MATT: That is 14 points of necrotic damage to
you.

3507
03:36:23,088 --> 03:36:25,216
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

3508
03:36:25,216 --> 03:36:28,036
SAM: Or the exact amount.

3509
03:36:28,036 --> 03:36:29,517
LAURA: Exact amount.

3510
03:36:29,517 --> 03:36:32,463
MATT: Oh no!

3511
03:36:32,463 --> 03:36:34,065
TALIESIN: Fuck fuck fuck.

3512
03:36:34,065 --> 03:36:36,155
LIAM: Cleric's down. One of our clerics is down.

3513
03:36:36,155 --> 03:36:41,545
MATT: You watch as the priest reaches out and
grabs onto the armor of Jester, and with a burst

3514
03:36:41,545 --> 03:36:50,017
of black energy, the veins under Jester's blue
skin begin to pulse with black energy, and she

3515
03:36:50,017 --> 03:36:55,393
screams out as her eyes loll back and close, and
she hits the ground unconscious.

3516
03:36:55,393 --> 03:36:56,467
MARISHA: She's next to me, right?

3517
03:36:56,467 --> 03:37:01,308
TRAVIS: Technically, there are <i>three</i> of us out,
because I ain't moving.

3518
03:37:01,308 --> 03:37:05,983
MARISHA: I'm next to two unconscious people going
(screaming).

3519
03:37:05,983 --> 03:37:13,137
MATT: Yeah. That ends the priest's turn. Your
turn, Shakäste.

3520
03:37:13,137 --> 03:37:17,212
LAURA: You have one of the healing potions.

3521
03:37:17,212 --> 03:37:27,168
LIAM: It's your call. I will help you with
decisions you make. You can get to the front of

3522
03:37:27,168 --> 03:37:28,543
those stairs.

3523
03:37:28,543 --> 03:37:34,271
KHARY: Yeah, let's see, I should move forward.

3524
03:37:34,271 --> 03:37:36,788
MATT: You have 30 feet to move forward.

3525
03:37:36,788 --> 03:37:39,880
TRAVIS: If you could put a beat down on the
priest, do it.

3526
03:37:39,880 --> 03:37:42,003
SAM: That will release the Hold Person.

3527
03:37:42,003 --> 03:37:44,174
TRAVIS: I have a healing potion in my
possessions.

3528
03:37:44,174 --> 03:37:45,877
LIAM: Do you have any spells slots left?

3529
03:37:45,877 --> 03:37:47,360
KHARY: I think I--

3530
03:37:47,360 --> 03:37:48,455
SAM: He's got the Spiritual Weapon.

3531
03:37:48,455 --> 03:37:52,639
MATT: The Spiritual Weapon can only move 20 feet,
though, which will only get it about there, unfortunately.

3532
03:37:52,639 --> 03:37:53,614
SAM: Damn.

3533
03:37:53,614 --> 03:37:57,073
LAURA: No, Spiritual Weapon can move 30 feet.

3534
03:37:57,073 --> 03:37:59,395
MATT: I thought it was 20 on a bonus action.

3535
03:37:59,395 --> 03:38:01,598
LAURA: Oh, maybe I'm wrong.

3536
03:38:01,598 --> 03:38:04,433
LIAM and KHARY: The range is 60 feet.

3537
03:38:04,433 --> 03:38:07,211
MATT: Well, the range of the spell is 60 feet, but
then the bonus action to move it is 20 feet and

3538
03:38:07,211 --> 03:38:08,409
repeat the attack. Sorry, guys.

3539
03:38:08,409 --> 03:38:09,178
LIAM: No, that's great.

3540
03:38:09,178 --> 03:38:12,808
MATT: You can move forward if you want to. Did you
want to move forward the rest of your--?

3541
03:38:12,808 --> 03:38:28,837
KHARY: Yeah, if I move is anything going to get
close enough? I could do Sacred Flame.

3542
03:38:28,837 --> 03:38:37,256
LIAM: That's all you can do is try to take down
the enemies, and we can help. That's all you can do.

3543
03:38:37,256 --> 03:38:42,890
KHARY: All I can do is move forward and Sacred
Flame the priest.

3544
03:38:42,890 --> 03:38:46,051
MATT: Okay. That's a wisdom save, right?

3545
03:38:46,051 --> 03:38:48,703
KHARY: Yeah, that's a wisdom save.

3546
03:38:48,703 --> 03:38:53,357
MATT: That is going to be an 11. Which, your DC is
13, that hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

3547
03:38:53,357 --> 03:38:55,950
KHARY: All right, going to roll damage. Come on.

3548
03:38:55,950 --> 03:38:58,615
LAURA: Man, hit the fucking priest!

3549
03:38:58,615 --> 03:39:02,025
KHARY: Three plus--

3550
03:39:02,025 --> 03:39:06,479
MATT: That's just three points of damage. Three
points of radiant damage. It bursts and he's still

3551
03:39:06,479 --> 03:39:11,396
trying to concentrate on the spell. He does make a
constitution saving throw. That's an eight. That's

3552
03:39:11,396 --> 03:39:15,095
a failure. The DC is ten. With that, your
paralysis ends.

3553
03:39:15,095 --> 03:39:15,708
TALIESIN: Oh, thank god!

3554
03:39:15,708 --> 03:39:25,077
MATT: Yeah, it's either half the damage or ten,
whichever is higher. With that, you blast it, and

3555
03:39:25,077 --> 03:39:32,509
he loses the spell, and all of a sudden your body
comes back into control of you, Fjord. You have

3556
03:39:32,509 --> 03:39:35,878
the bonus action. You can still move the weapon if
you want to.

3557
03:39:35,878 --> 03:39:36,668
LIAM: I'd get it into the business.

3558
03:39:36,668 --> 03:39:37,006
KHARY: Oh, absolutely.

3559
03:39:37,006 --> 03:39:42,040
MATT: It was up ten feet, technically. It can move
down and then move over here, and it would be down

3560
03:39:42,040 --> 03:39:43,875
on the ground right there.

3561
03:39:43,875 --> 03:39:46,085
LIAM: It's on its way for the next round.

3562
03:39:46,085 --> 03:39:46,335
KHARY: Sure. Okay.

3563
03:39:46,335 --> 03:39:48,132
MATT: If you wanted. You could move it anywhere
else you want to.

3564
03:39:48,132 --> 03:39:51,551
TRAVIS: Who do I pour that potion into, you or
you?

3565
03:39:53,031 --> 03:39:54,715
SAM: The <i>healer.</i>

3566
03:39:54,715 --> 03:40:01,743
KHARY: Stay right there, Estelle. She doesn't move
quickly, but she moves effectively.

3567
03:40:01,743 --> 03:40:06,889
MATT: The bust (humming) and rests floating in the
air. That brings us to the top; Molly, you're up.

3568
03:40:06,889 --> 03:40:12,523
TALIESIN: Fuck, there is so little I can do. I'm
going to move forward a bit, I'm going to move

3569
03:40:12,523 --> 03:40:20,183
close enough that I can-- I'm just going to keep
trying to-- Put me next to Caleb.

3570
03:40:20,183 --> 03:40:21,373
MATT: There you go.

3571
03:40:21,373 --> 03:40:26,466
TALIESIN: Shite. I'm just going to keep trying to
give disadvantage to the first attack on the

3572
03:40:26,466 --> 03:40:27,183
manticore.

3573
03:40:27,183 --> 03:40:28,073
MATT: What's the range on Vicious Mockery?

3574
03:40:28,073 --> 03:40:28,573
TALIESIN: 60 feet.

3575
03:40:28,573 --> 03:40:35,698
MATT: Yeah, you can do that here. Wisdom save for
the manticore. 19.

3576
03:40:35,698 --> 03:40:36,728
TALIESIN: Yeah, it saves.

3577
03:40:36,728 --> 03:40:37,414
MATT: Sorry.

3578
03:40:37,414 --> 03:40:44,549
TALIESIN: Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck. Not even In
infernal. Fuck fuck fuck.

3579
03:40:44,549 --> 03:40:50,139
MATT: (laughing) Fjord, you're up.

3580
03:40:50,149 --> 03:40:54,522
TRAVIS: What is it, an action or a bonus action to
pour a health potion into somebody's mouth?

3581
03:40:54,522 --> 03:40:55,656
MATT: It's an action.

3582
03:40:55,656 --> 03:40:59,007
TRAVIS: I'll run down and pour a health potion
into Jester's mouth.

3583
03:40:59,007 --> 03:41:03,212
LAURA: That's good, because that gets me up and I
can heal you.

3584
03:41:03,212 --> 03:41:05,678
LIAM: Yeah, in time for your turn.

3585
03:41:05,678 --> 03:41:10,489
MATT: You reach down, pull out the healing potion.
It's a regular healing potion, right?

3586
03:41:10,489 --> 03:41:11,545
TRAVIS: It was a regular.

3587
03:41:11,545 --> 03:41:14,384
MATT: Yeah, so that would be 2d4 plus two you
heal.

3588
03:41:17,224 --> 03:41:19,386
SAM: You roll? You roll? Who rolls?

3589
03:41:19,386 --> 03:41:20,831
TALIESIN: Doesn't matter.

3590
03:41:20,831 --> 03:41:22,549
LAURA: Six plus two. Eight!

3591
03:41:22,549 --> 03:41:23,698
MATT: So you heal eight.

3592
03:41:23,698 --> 03:41:27,199
TRAVIS: Can I use the rest of my movement to start
running up the stairs?

3593
03:41:27,199 --> 03:41:28,294
MATT: You may.

3594
03:41:28,294 --> 03:41:30,480
TRAVIS: I don't know how much I have left.

3595
03:41:30,480 --> 03:41:35,187
MATT: From there it was (counting) six, that's as
far as you get.

3596
03:41:35,187 --> 03:41:35,804
TRAVIS: Okay, fair enough. Okay.

3597
03:41:35,804 --> 03:41:40,541
MATT: As you move out of range, the priest is
going to make a strike at you with his dagger.

3598
03:41:40,541 --> 03:41:41,522
TRAVIS: Was I in melee of the priest?

3599
03:41:41,522 --> 03:41:44,500
MATT: Yeah, to get to her you would have.

3600
03:41:44,500 --> 03:41:47,568
TRAVIS: I'll stay in there, then. I couldn't see
where I was. Yeah, I'll stay close.

3601
03:41:47,568 --> 03:41:49,703
MATT: Yeah, because you would have moved-- Oh,
god.

3602
03:41:49,703 --> 03:41:51,903
SAM: Oh god, everyone's dead.

3603
03:41:51,903 --> 03:41:53,603
LAURA: It's all going to shit!

3604
03:41:53,603 --> 03:41:58,696
MATT: That's okay. You stay there. That end's
Fjord's turn, Jester, you're up. You are on the

3605
03:41:58,696 --> 03:42:03,651
ground, prone, but are now conscious and
breathing, as you feel the glass vial pulled away

3606
03:42:03,651 --> 03:42:07,080
from your lips, and Fjord looks down at you with a
nod, like "Go!"

3607
03:42:07,080 --> 03:42:15,351
LAURA: Thank you! I stand up. I'll reach out and
cast Cure Wounds on Nott.

3608
03:42:15,729 --> 03:42:19,644
SAM: (gasping)

3609
03:42:19,644 --> 03:42:22,858
MATT: Go ahead and roll that. That's a d8 plus
your wisdom modifier?

3610
03:42:22,858 --> 03:42:24,494
LAURA: Yes, it is. Sorry.

3611
03:42:24,494 --> 03:42:28,844
SAM: I just say to Beau: The fuck?!

3612
03:42:28,844 --> 03:42:34,663
(laughter)

3613
03:42:34,663 --> 03:42:37,046
LAURA: Eight points to heal.

3614
03:42:37,046 --> 03:42:39,291
MATT: So you heal eight points.

3615
03:42:39,291 --> 03:42:40,809
TRAVIS: The fuck.

3616
03:42:40,809 --> 03:42:48,560
LAURA: Then I guess we should start running, yes?
I use the remainder of my--

3617
03:42:48,560 --> 03:42:52,518
MATT: Movement to run? You can move 15 feet.

3618
03:42:52,518 --> 03:42:55,074
LAURA: Can I use my bonus action to dash?

3619
03:42:55,074 --> 03:42:58,220
MATT: You do not have that ability, unfortunately.
That's a rogue and monk ability to use a point.

3620
03:42:58,220 --> 03:43:01,430
Clerics do not get that. Sorry. Let's put you
there.

3621
03:43:01,430 --> 03:43:06,551
LAURA: My bonus action to whimper a little bit.

3622
03:43:06,551 --> 03:43:10,058
MATT: Okay. The priest does get attack of
opportunity on you as you run past, as you were

3623
03:43:10,058 --> 03:43:11,058
engaged in melee.

3624
03:43:11,058 --> 03:43:13,708
LAURA: I'm hoping the priest is lame.

3625
03:43:13,708 --> 03:43:14,822
MARISHA: Yeah, a weakling.

3626
03:43:14,822 --> 03:43:19,557
MATT: Well, he rolled a three. The dagger hits
your armor and scrapes off the metal. No effect.

3627
03:43:19,557 --> 03:43:22,276
That ends your turn, Jester. Nott, you're up.

3628
03:43:22,276 --> 03:43:25,002
SAM: Oh, this is crazy.

3629
03:43:25,002 --> 03:43:28,581
MATT: You're prone, technically, in Beau's arms
right now.

3630
03:43:28,581 --> 03:43:39,064
SAM: Sure. I will look up at the manticore, I'll
take out my last shitty tart that you gave me, and

3631
03:43:39,064 --> 03:43:45,890
crumple it onto the ground, and point up to the
manticore and say: What did the incontinent druid

3632
03:43:45,890 --> 03:43:53,830
say on his surprise birthday party? I'm so
excited, I wet my plants!

3633
03:43:53,830 --> 03:43:55,764
(groaning)

3634
03:43:55,764 --> 03:43:58,134
TRAVIS: Wow.

3635
03:43:58,134 --> 03:44:01,058
TALIESIN: Never mind, leave him behind.

3636
03:44:01,058 --> 03:44:03,663
KHARY: How much damage did that give?

3637
03:44:03,663 --> 03:44:06,658
TRAVIS: Yeah, to all of us? TPK up in this
business.

3638
03:44:06,658 --> 03:44:09,132
MATT: This is, I assume Hideous Laughter?

3639
03:44:09,132 --> 03:44:09,939
SAM: Yes, Hideous Laughter.

3640
03:44:09,939 --> 03:44:19,440
MATT: All right, we'll see if this works. Wisdom
saving throw. That is a 12. What is your DC?

3641
03:44:19,440 --> 03:44:20,425
SAM: 13.

3642
03:44:20,425 --> 03:44:21,583
(cheering)

3643
03:44:21,583 --> 03:44:23,569
MATT: There's been a lot of just under this game.

3644
03:44:23,569 --> 03:44:26,463
TALIESIN: Oh, god.

3645
03:44:26,463 --> 03:44:28,259
KHARY: The dad joke works!

3646
03:44:28,259 --> 03:44:33,988
MATT: Weirdly, as angry as this manticore is at
you-- You know what? I'm going to give it

3647
03:44:33,988 --> 03:44:38,075
advantage in the saving throw because you killed
its baby.

3648
03:44:38,075 --> 03:44:38,896
LAURA: Oh, that's just mean!

3649
03:44:38,896 --> 03:44:40,036
MATT: You killed its baby.

3650
03:44:40,036 --> 03:44:41,599
MARISHA: Hindsight advantage.

3651
03:44:41,599 --> 03:44:48,294
MATT: I'm allowing it, because I'm the fucking DM.
It doesn't help, I rolled a two. Shit. I felt it

3652
03:44:48,294 --> 03:44:51,238
was fair for the mother of the baby that you just
murdered.

3653
03:44:51,238 --> 03:44:53,263
SAM: You would have given it to us.

3654
03:44:53,263 --> 03:44:57,713
MATT: I would have, and from a narrative
standpoint it made sense. Still takes effect. The

3655
03:44:57,713 --> 03:45:03,257
manticore, turning around, eyes filled with fury
and anger, goes (growling). She all of a sudden

3656
03:45:03,257 --> 03:45:13,554
begins to chuckle. As the mouth opens from the
laughter, you see the jagged teeth, filled with

3657
03:45:13,554 --> 03:45:18,425
your own blood, and the tongue lashing around from
the laughter as it falls on the ground, prone and cackling.

3658
03:45:18,425 --> 03:45:22,056
TRAVIS: Is goblin blood red or green? Red?

3659
03:45:22,056 --> 03:45:26,579
SAM: I think it's like a black. I don't know.
Matt, what is it?

3660
03:45:26,579 --> 03:45:32,523
MATT: It's dark enough where, in this lighting, it
looks black.

3661
03:45:32,523 --> 03:45:35,749
LAURA: Hideous Laughter. Does that mean we all get
advantage on hits now?

3662
03:45:35,749 --> 03:45:38,282
MATT: It is prone, which means melee attacks do
get advantage against it.

3663
03:45:38,282 --> 03:45:39,748
SAM: Or we could leave.

3664
03:45:39,748 --> 03:45:40,448
TALIESIN: Run!

3665
03:45:40,448 --> 03:45:43,524
LAURA: But you guys! We've got a whole other
round!

3666
03:45:43,524 --> 03:45:44,024
SAM: Of what?

3667
03:45:44,024 --> 03:45:47,851
LAURA and LIAM: Attacks to wail on her.

3668
03:45:47,851 --> 03:45:48,638
SAM: Or to <i>leave</i>.

3669
03:45:48,638 --> 03:45:52,568
MATT: It's up to you. The manticore's pretty hurt.
The priest has taken a little damage, but the

3670
03:45:52,568 --> 03:45:58,023
priest also doesn't look very hardy. But it's up
to you. You can flee or you can finish it. There

3671
03:45:58,023 --> 03:46:01,193
are advantages and disadvantages. There are
advantages to both.

3672
03:46:01,193 --> 03:46:05,252
MATT and MARISHA: There are advantages to both!

3673
03:46:05,252 --> 03:46:14,488
KHARY: Are there ears on all of that crap that
this priest has on him? Are there any ears on him?

3674
03:46:14,498 --> 03:46:19,801
MATT: No ears. There is actually on the head. The
gnoll head has ears.

3675
03:46:19,801 --> 03:46:26,468
KHARY: They have ears on that thing. And if we
drag that fucking carcass back to the surface, I

3676
03:46:26,468 --> 03:46:29,427
bet that'll--

3677
03:46:29,427 --> 03:46:31,694
TRAVIS: Be worth a pretty penny?

3678
03:46:31,703 --> 03:46:33,884
MATT: You're probably not wrong.

3679
03:46:33,884 --> 03:46:37,794
KHARY: You know what? Forget that. I want that
fucking thing on my wall.

3680
03:46:39,494 --> 03:46:42,479
MATT: All righty. Well, that's up to you guys to
make your choices.

3681
03:46:42,479 --> 03:46:44,264
TALIESIN: How long does Hideous Laughter last?

3682
03:46:44,264 --> 03:46:45,595
LAURA: For at least a whole round.

3683
03:46:46,411 --> 03:46:48,173
MATT: Each time it takes damage.

3684
03:46:48,173 --> 03:46:50,397
MARISHA: Okay, we could unload and then run!

3685
03:46:50,397 --> 03:46:52,308
LAURA: And each time he takes damage?

3686
03:46:52,308 --> 03:46:53,005
MATT: It gets to make a save again.

3687
03:46:53,005 --> 03:46:54,799
SAM: On the end of his turn, he gets to make a
save.

3688
03:46:54,809 --> 03:46:57,472
MARISHA: If you hit him, he gets to make a save?

3689
03:46:57,472 --> 03:47:00,512
MATT: Yeah. And on the end of its turn it gets to
save.

3690
03:47:00,512 --> 03:47:02,272
TRAVIS: It's not like a tee off and then we go.

3691
03:47:02,272 --> 03:47:04,707
LAURA: Oh, I thought it was like a paralyzation
sort of thing.

3692
03:47:04,707 --> 03:47:06,174
SAM: So he might save right now.

3693
03:47:06,174 --> 03:47:08,055
MARISHA: We should go.

3694
03:47:08,055 --> 03:47:09,468
TRAVIS: We should stick to the plan.

3695
03:47:09,468 --> 03:47:10,668
MATT: Well, regardless--

3696
03:47:10,668 --> 03:47:12,679
LIAM: What about the dynamite?

3697
03:47:12,679 --> 03:47:15,964
KHARY: That's what I'm saying! I want to stick one
in its mouth!

3698
03:47:15,964 --> 03:47:17,027
MATT: That's up to you.

3699
03:47:17,027 --> 03:47:21,574
SAM: You might not get that chance! It's the
manticore's turn, and she might save right now!

3700
03:47:21,574 --> 03:47:24,989
MATT: Yeah, that's true. Because it is the
manticore-- you still have movement, if you want to.

3701
03:47:24,989 --> 03:47:25,919
MARISHA: Do you want me to put you down?

3702
03:47:25,919 --> 03:47:28,287
MATT: You have 15 feet of movement if you want
Beau to put you down.

3703
03:47:28,287 --> 03:47:30,590
SAM: Yeah. I will jump down and run.

3704
03:47:30,590 --> 03:47:31,719
MATT: Ten, 15.

3705
03:47:31,719 --> 03:47:35,353
TALIESIN: Can you also take your bonus action to
run too?

3706
03:47:35,353 --> 03:47:37,022
SAM: Sure, if I still have a bonus action.

3707
03:47:37,022 --> 03:47:37,642
MATT: You do, yeah.

3708
03:47:37,642 --> 03:47:43,830
SAM: Bonus action dash. Well, you know what? I'm
going to stay within 30 feet of the priest.

3709
03:47:43,830 --> 03:47:48,717
MATT: Okay. Good to know. All righty. Finishing
Nott's turn, the manticore's turn. The manticore's

3710
03:47:48,717 --> 03:47:52,527
chuckling, laughing on the ground, howling. It's
echoing throughout the chamber in this very

3711
03:47:52,527 --> 03:47:53,553
dark--

3712
03:47:53,553 --> 03:47:58,483
SAM: 35 feet of the priest.

3713
03:47:58,483 --> 03:48:04,278
MATT: I'll put you about, roughly, we'll say
there. The manticore's going to attempt to make

3714
03:48:04,278 --> 03:48:05,095
its wisdom saving throw.

3715
03:48:05,095 --> 03:48:10,503
TRAVIS: No! Fail!

3716
03:48:10,503 --> 03:48:13,934
MATT: That is a 12, again! I rolled two elevens in
a row!

3717
03:48:13,934 --> 03:48:15,444
LAURA: Laugh it up, Fuzzball!

3718
03:48:17,474 --> 03:48:23,981
MATT: The civilians continue to run and they are
just up the tunnel. You hear their heavy breathing

3719
03:48:23,981 --> 03:48:29,426
fade as they disappear into the darkness. Beau,
you're up.

3720
03:48:29,426 --> 03:48:36,732
MARISHA: What do we do? Are we running or are we
fighting?

3721
03:48:36,732 --> 03:48:38,531
TRAVIS: Whatever you want to do.

3722
03:48:38,531 --> 03:48:40,511
MATT: Beau, it's your choice. What are you doing?

3723
03:48:40,511 --> 03:48:45,246
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to, because I can, fuck
the priest.

3724
03:48:45,246 --> 03:48:47,638
MATT: Okay. You move in to the priest. Go for it.

3725
03:48:47,638 --> 03:48:55,091
MARISHA: Okay. Big ol' two-handed staff swing.
That's not bad. 16!

3726
03:48:55,091 --> 03:48:57,442
MATT: 16 hits! He's only wearing leather armor.

3727
03:48:57,442 --> 03:48:59,069
MARISHA: Nine points of damage.

3728
03:48:59,069 --> 03:49:06,083
MATT: Nine points of damage. Whack! Right across
the face. You knock part of the gnoll head off.

3729
03:49:06,083 --> 03:49:12,789
It's off-kilter to the side and he spits blood and
looks back at you, "Do not worry. He will come for

3730
03:49:12,789 --> 03:49:13,515
you too."

3731
03:49:13,515 --> 03:49:20,067
MARISHA: Ugh! Okay, in response to that, I'm going
to be like: Don't patronize me! Then I'm going to

3732
03:49:20,067 --> 03:49:23,684
fucking Flurry of Blows. Elbow strike him to an
uppercut.

3733
03:49:23,684 --> 03:49:24,584
MATT: Go for it.

3734
03:49:24,584 --> 03:49:32,749
MARISHA: First attack. Yeah, that hits, with a
12?

3735
03:49:32,749 --> 03:49:34,805
MATT: That hits!

3736
03:49:34,805 --> 03:49:37,576
MARISHA: Natural 12. And then, not so good. 12
again. Total.

3737
03:49:37,576 --> 03:49:39,846
MATT: 12 does not hit, unfortunately. But the next
one does.

3738
03:49:39,846 --> 03:49:45,696
MARISHA: Six plus four. Another ten points of
damage.

3739
03:49:45,696 --> 03:49:52,132
MATT: Ten points of damage, nice. With the staff
hit, he laughs at you, the blood spilling out on

3740
03:49:52,132 --> 03:49:56,027
the side of his chin. You smack him with the
elbow, miss with the upper cut, but as the elbow

3741
03:49:56,027 --> 03:50:00,870
cracks and hits you feel like the jaw kind of
dislodge a bit. As he looks back, he reaches up

3742
03:50:00,870 --> 03:50:04,008
and he's trying to put it back into place. He's
looking not too great.

3743
03:50:04,008 --> 03:50:10,638
MARISHA: Hang on, I messed up that. Three plus
four. I messed up.

3744
03:50:10,638 --> 03:50:13,595
MATT: You said ten? Yeah, you shouldn't have
done-- actually, it would've been seven.

3745
03:50:13,595 --> 03:50:18,298
MARISHA: Seven damage. I'm sorry. I was adding the
wrong modifier. I was looking at the wrong guy.

3746
03:50:18,298 --> 03:50:21,263
MATT: It's all good. No worries, so seven damage
on that one? That ends your turn?

3747
03:50:21,263 --> 03:50:24,324
MARISHA: Yes! No! I can still move? Right?

3748
03:50:24,324 --> 03:50:24,984
MATT: You can, yeah.

3749
03:50:24,984 --> 03:50:28,704
MARISHA: I'm going to now move past Fjord and
start heading away.

3750
03:50:28,704 --> 03:50:39,468
MATT: Okay. It already got an attack of
opportunity against--. So you move up (counting) 40.

3751
03:50:39,501 --> 03:50:41,819
MARISHA: I'll stay-- that's good.

3752
03:50:41,819 --> 03:50:45,465
MATT: All right. Caleb and the priest. Your turn
simultaneously.

3753
03:50:45,465 --> 03:50:50,435
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, I cannot see too well, so I'm going to
take a step forward between Mollymauk and Nott.

3754
03:50:50,435 --> 03:50:54,745
Just a little bit there. Now I can see that blond
hair, and I am tapped out, so I'm just going to

3755
03:50:54,745 --> 03:50:58,627
let my hand blacken and say a few arcane words and
then send a--

3756
03:50:58,627 --> 03:51:01,697
MATT: He does have three-quarters cover behind
that from your current position.

3757
03:51:01,697 --> 03:51:05,546
LIAM: Well then I will, if I can't see too well,
keep going down the steps until I can see him.

3758
03:51:05,546 --> 03:51:07,340
MATT: You can move there to get a view without
hitting--

3759
03:51:07,340 --> 03:51:13,815
LIAM: That's fine. That's not fine, but that's
fine. Fire Bolt and here it comes to you,

3760
03:51:13,815 --> 03:51:17,764
shithead. That is a 25 to hit.

3761
03:51:17,764 --> 03:51:18,623
ALL: It hits!

3762
03:51:18,623 --> 03:51:22,229
LIAM: But I could roll a one. I rolled a ten.

3763
03:51:22,229 --> 03:51:24,177
(cheering)

3764
03:51:24,177 --> 03:51:27,549
MATT: How do you want to do this?

3765
03:51:27,549 --> 03:51:29,716
(cheering)

3766
03:51:29,716 --> 03:51:36,525
LIAM: I'm going to extend my hand forward. I have
five fingers out and then I pull in four. I send

3767
03:51:36,525 --> 03:51:44,057
the flame down my hand because these people have
hurt my little friend. I want his hair to burn off

3768
03:51:44,057 --> 03:51:45,543
his head and die.

3769
03:51:45,543 --> 03:51:50,176
MATT: Okay. As you release the bolt, the anger in
your eyes, the fury coursing through the veins in

3770
03:51:50,176 --> 03:51:55,499
your hand. The Fire Bolt slams into the priest's
head, and he falls back on the ground, screaming.

3771
03:51:55,499 --> 03:52:01,540
As you watch, Ghost Rider-style, his head just
bursts into flame and burn away, until he falls

3772
03:52:01,540 --> 03:52:06,719
back to his knees. You can just see the darkened
expression of a black skull into the fire as he

3773
03:52:06,719 --> 03:52:11,180
falls. I need you to make a wisdom saving throw.

3774
03:52:12,770 --> 03:52:16,550
LAURA: What?! What's this mean?!

3775
03:52:16,550 --> 03:52:18,343
LIAM: That's a seven.

3776
03:52:18,343 --> 03:52:24,662
MATT: A wave of memories come flooding to you, and
you feel your motions grow slow.

3777
03:52:24,662 --> 03:52:26,494
LIAM: I was going to do this on my own.

3778
03:52:26,494 --> 03:52:35,264
MATT: You guys watch as Caleb stares at this, and
continues to stare at the guy burning in flames.

3779
03:52:35,264 --> 03:52:37,061
That ends your turn!

3780
03:52:37,061 --> 03:52:41,307
SAM and LAURA: What?

3781
03:52:41,307 --> 03:52:43,642
MATT: Shakäste, it's your turn.

3782
03:52:43,642 --> 03:52:45,995
LAURA and TRAVIS: (whispering) Backstory.

3783
03:52:45,995 --> 03:52:49,328
(laughter)

3784
03:52:49,328 --> 03:52:50,856
MATT: Shakäste, your turn.

3785
03:52:50,856 --> 03:52:58,188
KHARY: Yes. Well, I do believe I still have a
Spiritual Weapon.

3786
03:52:58,447 --> 03:52:59,367
MATT: You do.

3787
03:52:59,367 --> 03:53:00,292
LAURA: That's right!

3788
03:53:00,292 --> 03:53:09,609
KHARY: The Spiritual Weapon goes wandering over,
just as sassy as she wants to be. I do believe

3789
03:53:09,609 --> 03:53:19,029
that the underbelly of the manticore is still
waiting there for Estelle to tell him all kinds of

3790
03:53:19,029 --> 03:53:24,267
horrible things about what it's like to live in
South Florida.

3791
03:53:24,267 --> 03:53:27,677
MATT: Oh, that's particularly awful.

3792
03:53:27,677 --> 03:53:35,554
KHARY: Absolutely. First of all, exactly. You know
what? There's way too much gambling at the track.

3793
03:53:35,554 --> 03:53:44,851
Everybody's constantly upset about the humidity.
This is what your problem is. Maybe next time,

3794
03:53:44,851 --> 03:53:50,331
you'll eat something less human-like, baby. What
do I need to roll?

3795
03:53:50,331 --> 03:53:56,508
MATT: Roll a d20 plus five, with advantage because
it is prone. So roll a d20 twice and take the

3796
03:53:56,508 --> 03:53:57,938
higher of the two.

3797
03:53:57,938 --> 03:53:58,188
KHARY: Roll the 20 twice?

3798
03:53:58,188 --> 03:53:58,664
MATT: Correct.

3799
03:53:58,664 --> 03:54:03,514
KHARY: Nine. Three.

3800
03:54:03,514 --> 03:54:05,353
LAURA: Nine plus five?

3801
03:54:05,353 --> 03:54:09,206
MATT: Nine plus five is 14. That is just its armor
class. That hits. It has an armor class of 14. So

3802
03:54:09,206 --> 03:54:11,743
roll damage on that. d8 plus three.

3803
03:54:11,743 --> 03:54:19,782
KHARY: d8 plus three. That's this one. All right,
four. Four plus three is seven!

3804
03:54:19,782 --> 03:54:27,352
MATT: Seven points of damage! As the bust slams
into the manticore after your musings pierced its

3805
03:54:27,352 --> 03:54:31,504
soul, it's going to attempt to make a saving
throw, with advantage.

3806
03:54:31,504 --> 03:54:33,926
LAURA: With advantage? Why with advantage?

3807
03:54:33,926 --> 03:54:38,396
MATT: It's a two. Because whenever it takes an
impact from an attack, it gets an advantage on the

3808
03:54:38,396 --> 03:54:40,869
saving throw to break it. A two and a five,
however!

3809
03:54:40,869 --> 03:54:43,581
(cheering)

3810
03:54:43,581 --> 03:54:44,453
MARISHA: Aw, baby.

3811
03:54:44,453 --> 03:54:50,344
MATT: It's okay, it happens. It's good, it's
cinematic. It's fun. That's your bonus action. You

3812
03:54:50,344 --> 03:54:51,170
still have an action.

3813
03:54:51,170 --> 03:54:51,423
KHARY: I still have an action?

3814
03:54:51,423 --> 03:54:51,673
MATT: Yes you do.

3815
03:54:51,673 --> 03:54:56,620
KHARY: Well then. Let's see. Where am I?

3816
03:54:56,620 --> 03:55:00,152
LIAM: Did you use all your slots?

3817
03:55:00,152 --> 03:55:01,918
LAURA: You got healing in there?

3818
03:55:01,918 --> 03:55:03,602
SAM: Was that a bonus action to use the weapon?

3819
03:55:03,602 --> 03:55:06,029
MATT: Yeah. So you still have an action if you
want to cast another spell or do something else as

3820
03:55:06,029 --> 03:55:06,858
an action.

3821
03:55:06,858 --> 03:55:10,757
KHARY: Let's see. How is everybody feeling right
now?

3822
03:55:10,757 --> 03:55:11,558
TALIESIN: Not too good.

3823
03:55:11,558 --> 03:55:11,880
KHARY: Not too good?

3824
03:55:11,880 --> 03:55:16,159
MATT: The priest is already dead. The manticore's
pretty hurt. Some of them are pretty beat up and

3825
03:55:16,159 --> 03:55:18,520
low. Some of them seem to have avoided the fray.

3826
03:55:18,520 --> 03:55:27,471
KHARY: Yeah. Am I close enough to the point where
I-- I'm still pretty far from the manticore,

3827
03:55:27,471 --> 03:55:27,951
aren't I?

3828
03:55:27,951 --> 03:55:28,563
MATT: You're about 60 feet from it.

3829
03:55:28,563 --> 03:55:35,772
KHARY: I'm about 60 feet, but I would need to be
at about a 15-foot cube to do my Thunderwave.

3830
03:55:35,772 --> 03:55:36,498
MATT: Thunderwave, yeah.

3831
03:55:36,498 --> 03:55:39,609
LAURA: You could do a cantrip as an action.
Because you got enough distance.

3832
03:55:39,609 --> 03:55:44,777
KHARY: Yeah, I think the cantrip will-- let's hit
him again with Sacred Flame.

3833
03:55:44,777 --> 03:55:50,015
MATT: Sacred Flame? All right. That will be an
eight plus one for the wisdom modifier. That does

3834
03:55:50,015 --> 03:55:52,263
not succeed! So roll, that's d8 radiant damage.

3835
03:55:52,263 --> 03:55:54,198
SAM: So that worked?

3836
03:55:54,198 --> 03:55:55,023
LAURA: Yeah. 1d8 radiant.

3837
03:55:55,023 --> 03:55:56,951
SAM: Oh, so you roll!

3838
03:55:56,951 --> 03:55:58,164
KHARY: Oh, so I do roll!

3839
03:55:58,164 --> 03:55:58,568
MATT: You did damage, yeah.

3840
03:55:58,568 --> 03:56:01,301
KHARY: I did damage. Oh, <i>you</i> did wrong, so I did
right!

3841
03:56:01,301 --> 03:56:04,469
MATT: Exactly! That's how spells work a lot of the
time, man.

3842
03:56:04,469 --> 03:56:08,409
KHARY: Big money. Come on, baby. That's a six.

3843
03:56:08,409 --> 03:56:15,947
MATT: A six? As is tradition, it seems, for our
guests, how do you want to do this?

3844
03:56:15,947 --> 03:56:20,036
(cheering)

3845
03:56:20,036 --> 03:56:24,763
MATT: That's ridiculous, by the way! That's fucked
up! I'm counting and I'm like, if he gets the kill

3846
03:56:24,763 --> 03:56:26,476
this is going to-- this is ridiculous.

3847
03:56:26,476 --> 03:56:27,120
LIAM: That's hospitality.

3848
03:56:27,120 --> 03:56:29,250
MATT: That's hospitality. Jesus Christ!

3849
03:56:29,250 --> 03:56:32,212
MARISHA: Put. That. Shit. On. Your. Wall. Describe
it!

3850
03:56:32,212 --> 03:56:37,938
MATT: So how do you want to do this? As it's on
the ground, laughing and cackling and writhing.

3851
03:56:37,938 --> 03:56:47,895
KHARY: I drop the reed that's in my hand, and I
start to play with the flames that start to light

3852
03:56:47,895 --> 03:56:53,992
on the edges of my fingers. As I slowly bring them
together, there's a musical interlude that starts

3853
03:56:53,992 --> 03:57:04,439
to play and shoots towards the manticore. Diving
down her throat, and bursting through the chest of

3854
03:57:04,439 --> 03:57:15,696
her, and exploding her heart. You know what? I did
that out of love. For someone who just lost their child.

3855
03:57:15,701 --> 03:57:23,106
MATT: There you go. As Shakäste smiles, the
merciful grin of a person who knows that the loss

3856
03:57:23,106 --> 03:57:28,512
of a child is hard, you release this torrent of
sound energy into the cackling mouth of the female

3857
03:57:28,512 --> 03:57:36,211
manticore. As the writhing stops, and she begins
to stand up, looking down, looks back at the

3858
03:57:36,211 --> 03:57:46,258
corpse of the child now laid still. Looks back at
you with a look of pity and acceptance before

3859
03:57:46,258 --> 03:57:52,155
(explosion). There is a burst of gore out of the
chest, and the creature just falls to the ground,

3860
03:57:52,155 --> 03:57:57,055
motionless. The wings flopping onto the ground,
still. And silence takes the chamber.

3861
03:57:57,055 --> 03:58:06,405
(silence)

3862
03:58:06,405 --> 03:58:09,199
TRAVIS: Well, time to light the TNT, let's go.

3863
03:58:09,199 --> 03:58:14,173
TALIESIN: I'm going to douse the flames. I'm going
to run down to the priest and douse the flames,

3864
03:58:14,173 --> 03:58:16,456
and then give Caleb a good slap on the face.

3865
03:58:16,456 --> 03:58:19,674
MATT: Okay. Caleb comes to.

3866
03:58:19,674 --> 03:58:20,515
LIAM: (slapping)

3867
03:58:20,515 --> 03:58:25,820
TALIESIN: Hey! Back in the game! Time for that
later. You all right?

3868
03:58:25,820 --> 03:58:27,585
LIAM: Yeah.

3869
03:58:27,585 --> 03:58:29,735
TALIESIN: All right. Big kiss on the forehead and
then walking away.

3870
03:58:29,735 --> 03:58:31,519
MARISHA and KHARY: I'm--

3871
03:58:31,519 --> 03:58:32,866
KHARY: No, please.

3872
03:58:32,866 --> 03:58:35,850
MARISHA: I was just going to say, I'm going to do
a quick scan. See if there's anything of interest.

3873
03:58:35,878 --> 03:58:37,923
MATT: Make a perception check.

3874
03:58:37,923 --> 03:58:43,381
MARISHA: Copy. Natural 19. 22.

3875
03:58:43,381 --> 03:58:48,706
MATT: Amongst the chunks of flesh and rather
horrible attire, there's a couple of interesting

3876
03:58:49,383 --> 03:58:53,327
adornments on the priest. The nest looks like it's
a mishmash of all kinds of things cobbled

3877
03:58:53,327 --> 03:58:54,341
together.

3878
03:58:54,341 --> 03:58:57,705
MARISHA: I'll definitely take the adornments from
the priest.

3879
03:58:57,705 --> 03:59:07,898
MATT: Okay. From that, there was a set of goggles
that were affixed over the priest's eyes, of a

3880
03:59:07,898 --> 03:59:08,434
dark lens.

3881
03:59:08,434 --> 03:59:12,613
MARISHA: Can I see? If I can see in the dark. I
need night vision goggles!

3882
03:59:12,613 --> 03:59:13,457
LIAM: You do.

3883
03:59:13,457 --> 03:59:18,785
MATT: There is also that reddish glove that was
affixed to his right hand.

3884
03:59:21,425 --> 03:59:25,544
LAURA: Don't touch it! I wonder if that makes
spells better. (gasps)

3885
03:59:27,514 --> 03:59:30,927
TRAVIS: I'll run up onto the nest and start
looking for stuff.

3886
03:59:30,927 --> 03:59:32,888
MATT: Make an investigation check for me, please.

3887
03:59:32,888 --> 03:59:36,272
TALIESIN: You all right there? You all right?

3888
03:59:36,272 --> 03:59:38,425
SAM: Never better!

3889
03:59:38,425 --> 03:59:39,449
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

3890
03:59:39,449 --> 03:59:41,889
LAURA: Yay! Find all the shit!

3891
03:59:41,889 --> 03:59:44,537
MATT: No shit! What's the total there for that?

3892
03:59:44,537 --> 03:59:45,261
TRAVIS: 24.

3893
03:59:45,261 --> 03:59:53,166
MATT: All right. As you tear through the rubble of
this nest, you find a few interesting things: a

3894
03:59:53,166 --> 03:59:57,944
skeletal hand that has been mostly chewed through,
though a single fleshy finger still holds a ring

3895
03:59:57,944 --> 04:00:06,495
of beautiful silver make and a blue gem that
catches your attention. What at first looks like

3896
04:00:06,495 --> 04:00:13,783
part of the wooden riff-raff that makes the nest,
you pull out a refined and well-carved stick that

3897
04:00:13,783 --> 04:00:17,039
doesn't match the rest of the rather rough wood.

3898
04:00:17,039 --> 04:00:21,792
TALIESIN: I know I'm so excited, our first loot.

3899
04:00:21,792 --> 04:00:22,614
LAURA: This is so exciting!

3900
04:00:22,614 --> 04:00:32,546
MATT: Also, tangled within the mass, you find
chains but larger than normal chains. These chains

3901
04:00:32,546 --> 04:00:38,959
are attached to a set of unlocked manacles, much
larger than any human manacles you've seen. There

3902
04:00:38,959 --> 04:00:45,541
are four identical loops, a little over one foot
in diameter, all attached via this chain to one

3903
04:00:45,541 --> 04:00:47,919
larger one about four feet in diameter.

3904
04:00:47,919 --> 04:00:48,728
SAM: That's huge.

3905
04:00:48,728 --> 04:00:51,181
MARISHA: Was it for the manticore?

3906
04:00:51,181 --> 04:00:56,685
MATT: It looks like it would have been the size
for a manticore. Since you rolled so high in

3907
04:00:56,685 --> 04:01:00,915
investigation, you also notice that these
manacles, which are open, have a single rune

3908
04:01:00,915 --> 04:01:07,179
pressed into where they meet and lock in place, as
there is no other visible locking mechanism. You

3909
04:01:07,179 --> 04:01:15,453
are unable to really, at the moment, ascertain the
nature of it. These manacles are fresh, they're

3910
04:01:15,453 --> 04:01:21,985
clean compared to all the other stuff in here.
They are there.

3911
04:01:21,985 --> 04:01:25,227
MARISHA: Are the runes recognizable in any way?

3912
04:01:25,227 --> 04:01:28,278
MATT: Make an arcana-- are you proficient in
arcana?

3913
04:01:28,278 --> 04:01:29,180
TRAVIS: I'll make an arcana check.

3914
04:01:29,180 --> 04:01:31,374
MATT: Are you proficient in arcana?

3915
04:01:31,374 --> 04:01:35,108
TRAVIS: I have a pretty high bonus, I don't think
I'm proficient in it.

3916
04:01:35,108 --> 04:01:39,265
LIAM: I would like to sit on my ass and look at
the ground.

3917
04:01:39,265 --> 04:01:41,430
TRAVIS: I am proficient in it.

3918
04:01:41,430 --> 04:01:43,550
MATT: Make an arcana check, please.

3919
04:01:43,550 --> 04:01:45,061
TRAVIS: Seven.

3920
04:01:45,061 --> 04:01:47,961
MATT: You're unable to really ascertain the nature
of the runes, unfortunately.

3921
04:01:47,961 --> 04:01:53,941
LAURA: I'm going to walk up and pet the
manticore's mantle.

3922
04:01:53,941 --> 04:01:55,860
MATT: Okay.

3923
04:01:55,860 --> 04:01:58,207
TRAVIS: Aw, fuck that thing.

3924
04:01:58,207 --> 04:02:03,093
KHARY: I'd like to cast a spell.

3925
04:02:03,093 --> 04:02:05,019
MATT: What would you like to cast?

3926
04:02:05,019 --> 04:02:06,013
KHARY: Fog Cloud.

3927
04:02:06,013 --> 04:02:13,251
MATT: Okay. You watch as the central portion of
the chamber begins to fill with a thick mist,

3928
04:02:13,251 --> 04:02:18,466
somewhat obscuring your vision more than a few
feet in front of you.

3929
04:02:18,466 --> 04:02:21,383
LAURA: What was that?

3930
04:02:21,383 --> 04:02:23,904
TALIESIN: Is this supposed to happen?

3931
04:02:23,904 --> 04:02:24,613
SAM: What's going on?

3932
04:02:24,613 --> 04:02:24,863
LAURA: We should get out of here.

3933
04:02:24,863 --> 04:02:35,234
KHARY: I step behind Nott and whisper in her ear,
I say that: This was a bold move you made and we

3934
04:02:35,234 --> 04:02:44,330
wouldn't have made it, we wouldn't have succeeded
without you, so I say you earned that gold. But

3935
04:02:44,330 --> 04:02:48,380
make no mistake, be careful where you put your
fingers.

3936
04:02:48,380 --> 04:02:53,953
SAM: Yes, fog monster.

3937
04:02:53,953 --> 04:03:03,857
MATT: All right. What else would you like to do?

3938
04:03:03,857 --> 04:03:06,196
LAURA: Should we get out of here, I guess.

3939
04:03:06,196 --> 04:03:07,170
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3940
04:03:07,170 --> 04:03:12,858
LAURA: Anything else in the chamber? Does it look
like there's any other little, interesting things

3941
04:03:12,858 --> 04:03:14,993
in there?

3942
04:03:14,993 --> 04:03:15,799
TRAVIS: Hey, Molly?

3943
04:03:15,799 --> 04:03:16,621
TALIESIN: Yeah?

3944
04:03:16,621 --> 04:03:20,143
MATT: Honestly, it looks like everything was
clustered in the nest or on the priest.

3945
04:03:20,143 --> 04:03:23,579
TRAVIS: You want to help me butcher that manticore
head?

3946
04:03:23,579 --> 04:03:25,422
TALIESIN: Let's do this.

3947
04:03:25,422 --> 04:03:26,321
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3948
04:03:26,321 --> 04:03:33,874
MATT: Easily enough. Within but a few moments,
between the triple-blades that the two of you

3949
04:03:33,874 --> 04:03:40,728
wield, you manage to carve a fresh and carryable
by two of you-- this is now the second beast head

3950
04:03:40,728 --> 04:03:46,012
you guys have acquired, carrying along with you--
a female manticore head.

3951
04:03:46,012 --> 04:03:50,483
SAM: We're not going to take those giant manacles
are we?

3952
04:03:50,483 --> 04:03:51,296
LAURA: Yeah.

3953
04:03:51,296 --> 04:03:52,724
KHARY: I'll take the tail.

3954
04:03:52,724 --> 04:03:54,424
TRAVIS: Yeah we'll be taking all of that.

3955
04:03:54,424 --> 04:03:56,856
SAM: It's huge, can we carry that?

3956
04:03:56,856 --> 04:04:01,350
MATT: All the manacles together probably weigh
about 25 pounds, so it's carryable.

3957
04:04:01,350 --> 04:04:03,339
TRAVIS: Just over the shoulder, just walk out.

3958
04:04:03,339 --> 04:04:07,621
MATT: You couldn't carry it.

3959
04:04:07,621 --> 04:04:09,719
SAM: I can't carry it, that's how much I weigh.

3960
04:04:09,719 --> 04:04:11,222
TRAVIS: Even I couldn't carry that.

3961
04:04:11,222 --> 04:04:13,964
TALIESIN: Caleb, come on.

3962
04:04:13,964 --> 04:04:15,944
MARISHA: Hey, you all right?

3963
04:04:15,944 --> 04:04:16,774
TALIESIN: Later.

3964
04:04:16,774 --> 04:04:17,418
LIAM: Yeah.

3965
04:04:17,418 --> 04:04:18,735
TALIESIN: There's time for that later.

3966
04:04:18,735 --> 04:04:19,283
LIAM: Yeah.

3967
04:04:19,283 --> 04:04:22,506
TALIESIN: Come on. Let's go get some sunlight.

3968
04:04:22,506 --> 04:04:27,770
MARISHA: I grab Caleb, wrap an arm around him, and
try to walk him out.

3969
04:04:27,770 --> 04:04:30,945
TALIESIN: I'm going to grab the other side, we're
going to-- yep.

3970
04:04:30,945 --> 04:04:32,107
TALIESIN: You did good.

3971
04:04:32,107 --> 04:04:35,853
LAURA: Well I'm still here with this big, giant
manticore head so-- you guys got Caleb?

3972
04:04:35,853 --> 04:04:36,981
TRAVIS: I'm helping out.

3973
04:04:39,171 --> 04:04:41,908
KHARY: You're going through a change, my friend,
and that's not a bad thing.

3974
04:04:41,908 --> 04:04:46,993
(laughter)

3975
04:04:46,993 --> 04:04:53,118
MATT: All right. You guys manage to exit the
mines, it seems that the remainder of the gnoll

3976
04:04:53,118 --> 04:05:00,017
warband have either scattered or collapsed beneath
the earlier tunnel falling.

3977
04:05:00,017 --> 04:05:01,144
KHARY: Gnoll cowards.

3978
04:05:02,734 --> 04:05:05,066
MARISHA: Cowardly gnolls, cowardly gnolls.

3979
04:05:11,036 --> 04:05:13,032
LIAM: You just cured me.

3980
04:05:15,212 --> 04:05:21,847
MATT: You bring yourself back to the surface. The
light of the day is growing closer to sunset,

3981
04:05:21,847 --> 04:05:28,570
another hour, hour and a half or so before the sun
sets, but you return to the shack, which has been

3982
04:05:28,570 --> 04:05:34,262
untouched, unsullied since your leaving. The
remainder of the survivors greet you upon you

3983
04:05:34,262 --> 04:05:41,392
letting them know you've returned, and you watch
two more reunions occur as the two individuals you

3984
04:05:41,730 --> 04:05:47,759
had saved from the belly of the manticore find the
rest of their family within the survivors. You

3985
04:05:47,759 --> 04:05:54,739
gather the rest of the bodies, and whoever needs
the travel, and begin to load up the cart you

3986
04:05:54,739 --> 04:05:58,877
brought with you, as well as the manticore head,
unless you want to carry that back to town yourself.

3987
04:05:58,877 --> 04:06:01,836
LAURA: I think it might be easier to put it on the
cart.

3988
04:06:01,836 --> 04:06:05,609
MATT: You can rope it onto the cart without much
of an issue, though you still have a single horse

3989
04:06:05,609 --> 04:06:10,837
pulling a lot of people and a lot of manticore
head. That horse is not going to be traveling at

3990
04:06:10,837 --> 04:06:13,965
maximum speed, it's going to be a slow pace on that
thing.

3991
04:06:13,965 --> 04:06:20,053
LAURA: I mean, if it's all slow then it doesn't
matter I can walk alongside it and pull the

3992
04:06:20,053 --> 04:06:20,890
manticore head.

3993
04:06:20,890 --> 04:06:28,345
MATT: Eventually after night falls, you can make
camp or you continue to make your way to Alfield.

3994
04:06:29,042 --> 04:06:31,811
It's only a few miles off and you'll probably get
there maybe an hour or two after sunset.

3995
04:06:31,811 --> 04:06:32,444
TALIESIN: Sure.

3996
04:06:32,444 --> 04:06:33,353
LAURA: We should probably just get there.

3997
04:06:33,353 --> 04:06:34,939
TALIESIN: Let's make it all the way back.

3998
04:06:34,939 --> 04:06:38,981
MATT: All right. As you guys make your way under
the outskirts of town, back through the forest

3999
04:06:38,981 --> 04:06:48,449
that cradles the northeast side of the city, a
handful of crownsguard that are keeping watch for

4000
04:06:48,449 --> 04:06:54,238
any sort of incursion watch you approach and
immediately one of them puts up a hand, "Halt. Who

4001
04:06:54,238 --> 04:06:54,995
"goes there?"

4002
04:06:54,995 --> 04:06:57,536
TALIESIN: All hail, the conquering heroes!

4003
04:06:57,613 --> 04:07:01,401
LAURA: The saviors of Alfield have returned!

4004
04:07:01,401 --> 04:07:02,897
TALIESIN: Huzzah!

4005
04:07:02,897 --> 04:07:15,782
MATT: "Right the, um, yes-- come this way," he
seems to not be able to deal with the fact that

4006
04:07:15,782 --> 04:07:19,964
you've arrived with all of these survivors, and
the head of a manticore being pulled by this poor horse.

4007
04:07:19,964 --> 04:07:22,638
SAM: It's two horses.

4008
04:07:22,638 --> 04:07:25,092
TRAVIS: There are two horses.

4009
04:07:25,092 --> 04:07:28,099
SAM: W.C and Crapper.

4010
04:07:28,099 --> 04:07:36,712
MATT: Making your way into the town. Since you've
seen it last, a number of buildings still lay

4011
04:07:36,712 --> 04:07:43,055
in cinders, ash, and burned structures, but the
people are in the process of cleaning and

4012
04:07:43,055 --> 04:07:48,460
rebuilding their lives from the night before where
this first attack initially happened. Within a

4013
04:07:48,460 --> 04:07:54,780
short time, the crownsguard seemed to have brought
Bryce back for you. Bryce, which you have not met

4014
04:07:54,780 --> 04:08:03,807
yet, is currently the Watchmaster of the town. You
see a genderfluid half-elf with blonde

4015
04:08:03,807 --> 04:08:08,679
shoulder-length hair and armor. They seem to be
recovering from the wound they sustained the night

4016
04:08:08,679 --> 04:08:15,251
before and as you approach they immediately come
up to you with a bit of a jog and say, "My gods,

4017
04:08:15,251 --> 04:08:22,119
"you've certainly come through on my-- what is
that?"

4018
04:08:22,119 --> 04:08:24,189
LAURA: It's a manticore head.

4019
04:08:24,189 --> 04:08:25,749
TALIESIN: There was a lot.

4020
04:08:25,749 --> 04:08:32,125
MATT: "Apparently." They scratch their head, and
shake their head in wonderment, "Well, you've--

4021
04:08:32,125 --> 04:08:41,660
(laughs) "Thank you. What do we call you?"

4022
04:08:41,660 --> 04:08:43,302
MARISHA: Oh shit.

4023
04:08:43,302 --> 04:08:44,876
LAURA: Oh fuck.

4024
04:08:44,876 --> 04:08:49,544
SAM: We'll get back to you.

4025
04:08:49,544 --> 04:08:50,848
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4026
04:08:50,848 --> 04:08:52,213
LAURA: We're still a--

4027
04:08:52,213 --> 04:08:53,799
TALIESIN: This is all very new.

4028
04:08:53,799 --> 04:08:55,109
TRAVIS: We're the TBDs.

4029
04:08:55,109 --> 04:09:01,654
MATT: "Very well." The woman by the way, who you
had helped earlier, she comes forward with two of

4030
04:09:01,654 --> 04:09:10,450
the members, and they come forward to the
Watchmaster and they say, "Bryce, Watchmaster, all

4031
04:09:10,450 --> 04:09:22,478
"of these people came and helped my baby. And--"
and turns and looks at you and is looking about to

4032
04:09:22,478 --> 04:09:27,686
introduce you, if you have a moment you wish to
halt or intercede.

4033
04:09:27,686 --> 04:09:43,598
KHARY: I stop. I hold my hand up. I put my finger
over my lips. Shh.

4034
04:09:45,687 --> 04:09:51,716
MATT: "Anyway, thank you all." Other folks are
starting to come out of their respective homes now

4035
04:09:51,716 --> 04:09:57,319
to see this spectacle. Children are gawking and
you hear gasps at the sight of the horrible beast

4036
04:09:57,319 --> 04:10:00,537
head, the tongue lolling out and dragging across
the ground.

4037
04:10:00,537 --> 04:10:05,554
Other people are gathering and having
reunions, other people are beginning to identify

4038
04:10:05,554 --> 04:10:09,886
the dead that have been brought in the cart and
while there is sadness and crying, there is also

4039
04:10:09,886 --> 04:10:17,548
closure. There are even some still that are
disappointed to not see those they had hoped to

4040
04:10:17,548 --> 04:10:27,991
see amongst those who had been recovered. Given
that still, a hero's night is to be prepared and

4041
04:10:27,991 --> 04:10:34,601
people begin to prepare food. For a brief moment
past the darkness, you can hear music begin to

4042
04:10:34,601 --> 04:10:40,135
build as people begin to bring chairs and
tables out to the center of the town square, the

4043
04:10:40,135 --> 04:10:46,818
intersection of where Alfield's simple backwoods
lifestyle seems to still understand what

4044
04:10:46,818 --> 04:10:53,540
celebration is in the face of victory. As what
better case is there to be but to celebrate those

4045
04:10:53,540 --> 04:11:06,617
who stood up to such evils? As you all think over
what you've done, this ragtag group of wandering

4046
04:11:06,617 --> 04:11:15,465
know-nothings that have managed to come together
and do a good thing. For some coin, maybe, but a

4047
04:11:15,465 --> 04:11:17,555
good thing nonetheless.

4048
04:11:17,555 --> 04:11:21,758
LAURA: I pull out the jar of ears.

4049
04:11:21,758 --> 04:11:27,562
(laughter)

4050
04:11:27,562 --> 04:11:37,443
LAURA: Before I hand them over, I open the lid and
I whisper in: Thadeus Candleglow says hello. I

4051
04:11:37,443 --> 04:11:40,497
shut it. I think I did what he asked.

4052
04:11:40,497 --> 04:11:44,068
SAM: He said to do that. He said to say that to
the people.

4053
04:11:44,068 --> 04:11:46,021
LAURA: They heard it.

4054
04:11:46,021 --> 04:11:51,235
LIAM: Also, Caleb has been very distant for the
last couple of hours, but absentmindedly scoops up

4055
04:11:51,235 --> 04:11:55,879
Nott's hand. Doesn't look at Nott, but holds
Nott's hand.

4056
04:11:55,879 --> 04:12:06,154
SAM: I stealthily take my bag of coin and slide it
into his back pocket, and I pat it and say: I got

4057
04:12:06,154 --> 04:12:08,663
you some book money.

4058
04:12:08,663 --> 04:12:24,097
KHARY: Shakäste is standing at a distance.
Everyone else is walking towards the village. The

4059
04:12:24,097 --> 04:12:32,632
Duchess is perched on his shoulder, and he
scrawling something in the dirt with that long

4060
04:12:32,632 --> 04:12:42,501
reed. It's kind of an "H." And he fades into the
forest.

4061
04:12:42,501 --> 04:12:46,014
MARISHA: We don't get to say goodbye.

4062
04:12:46,014 --> 04:12:47,289
LAURA: He's the coolest

4063
04:12:47,289 --> 04:12:48,457
MARISHA: He's so cool.

4064
04:12:48,457 --> 04:12:49,982
MATT: On that note, we're going to end tonight's
game.

4065
04:12:49,982 --> 04:12:53,075
(groaning)

4066
04:12:53,075 --> 04:12:55,655
LIAM: Khary!

4067
04:12:55,655 --> 04:12:58,359
MATT: Khary! That was amazing, man!

4068
04:12:58,359 --> 04:13:02,019
MARISHA: Have you ever played before?

4069
04:13:02,019 --> 04:13:03,500
KHARY: With my kids.

4070
04:13:03,500 --> 04:13:05,086
LAURA: You're so epic.

4071
04:13:05,086 --> 04:13:06,460
MARISHA: You're so good.

4072
04:13:06,460 --> 04:13:10,747
MATT: Dude. Thank you, finally. We've been wanting
to have you on for so long, but schedules haven't

4073
04:13:10,747 --> 04:13:12,681
lined up. I'm so glad we could.

4074
04:13:12,762 --> 04:13:27,766
KHARY: Sometimes I can't believe my luck. I love
the things people ask me to do and I can't believe

4075
04:13:27,766 --> 04:13:32,104
I get to hang out with you guys and do this, this
has been so much fun, I don't know how to thank you.

4076
04:13:32,104 --> 04:13:34,780
MATT: Pleasure is ours, man, thank you so much,
seriously.

4077
04:13:34,780 --> 04:13:36,326
KHARY: Oh!

4078
04:13:36,326 --> 04:13:38,802
SAM: Are you inviting us on your show?

4079
04:13:38,802 --> 04:13:44,499
KHARY: I have a gift! Is it all right if I--?

4080
04:13:44,499 --> 04:13:45,766
MATT: Yeah, go for it.

4081
04:13:45,766 --> 04:13:47,669
LAURA: Do you have a present?

4082
04:13:47,669 --> 04:13:49,186
KHARY: I do have a present.

4083
04:13:49,186 --> 04:13:50,274
MATT: Kind of.

4084
04:13:50,274 --> 04:13:59,176
KHARY: Yeah, sort of, from your old friend. Let's
see I-- let's see.

4085
04:13:59,176 --> 04:14:03,598
LIAM: Uh oh. All right, I know how this works.

4086
04:14:03,598 --> 04:14:07,061
(laughter)

4087
04:14:07,061 --> 04:14:11,100
KHARY: I was given something from Will Friedle.

4088
04:14:11,100 --> 04:14:15,301
SAM: Is it a venereal disease?

4089
04:14:15,301 --> 04:14:22,227
KHARY: At first he was like, "Oh, I've got
something for you."

4090
04:14:22,227 --> 04:14:24,068
LIAM: Slipping you the digits.

4091
04:14:24,068 --> 04:14:28,852
KHARY: Yes, he brought me this 20-sided dice.

4092
04:14:28,852 --> 04:14:30,388
LAURA: It's so pretty.

4093
04:14:30,388 --> 04:14:31,876
KHARY: It is, it's lovely, isn't it?

4094
04:14:31,876 --> 04:14:33,692
LIAM: He's got gloves on him, don't touch it.

4095
04:14:33,692 --> 04:14:34,771
MARISHA: What's it mean?

4096
04:14:34,771 --> 04:14:36,323
LAURA: It was up Will's butt.

4097
04:14:36,323 --> 04:14:37,999
TRAVIS: He carried it in his ass.

4098
04:14:37,999 --> 04:14:39,873
LIAM: Crystallized rice.

4099
04:14:39,873 --> 04:14:42,318
MATT: Ass-20s, it's like ass pennies.

4100
04:14:42,318 --> 04:14:56,048
KHARY: My ass-- no. He played with this,
apparently, but at some point, it was touched by

4101
04:14:56,048 --> 04:14:57,163
Wil Wheaton.

4102
04:14:57,163 --> 04:14:59,883
ALL: Oh no!

4103
04:14:59,883 --> 04:15:05,723
KHARY: Exactly. At some point, I had a hammer--

4104
04:15:05,723 --> 04:15:09,180
MATT: You know what we should do, because we don't
want to do anything near the table, after this,

4105
04:15:09,180 --> 04:15:13,077
we're going to go ahead and record a video of you
dealing with that like the Ring in Mount Doom.

4106
04:15:13,077 --> 04:15:14,255
KHARY: Exactly.

4107
04:15:14,255 --> 04:15:15,883
MATT: We'll put it up on socials.

4108
04:15:15,883 --> 04:15:18,960
KHARY: He gave this to me as if I would use it
today. I was like, you know what, that's the last

4109
04:15:18,960 --> 04:15:20,730
thing I'm going to do.

4110
04:15:20,730 --> 04:15:22,132
MATT: He had it blessed and everything, you were
telling me.

4111
04:15:22,132 --> 04:15:31,798
KHARY: He said that two witches blessed this thing
and that it was okay. I watched him roll it, and

4112
04:15:31,798 --> 04:15:34,631
it seemed like it was okay, but there's no way
this thing can be okay.

4113
04:15:34,631 --> 04:15:36,306
MATT: It's safer for everyone.

4114
04:15:36,306 --> 04:15:42,622
KHARY: Rather than have any foolish soul wander
upon it, we're going do with this thing, like

4115
04:15:42,622 --> 04:15:46,827
you say, we're going to take this thing out.

4116
04:15:46,827 --> 04:15:56,136
MATT: We'll have that video for you guys in the
near future. Guys, great game. We'll take this up

4117
04:15:56,136 --> 04:15:57,373
next week.

4118
04:15:57,373 --> 04:15:58,699
LAURA: I can't believe we survived.

4119
04:15:58,699 --> 04:15:59,780
MARISHA: We're heroes.

4120
04:15:59,780 --> 04:16:00,807
TALIESIN: We lived.

4121
04:16:00,807 --> 04:16:03,803
LIAM: Just for one day.

4122
04:16:03,803 --> 04:16:05,374
KHARY: The plan was perfect.

4123
04:16:05,374 --> 04:16:09,652
MATT: The plan was perfect. A couple things didn't
work out to get out of there in time, I was hoping

4124
04:16:09,652 --> 04:16:10,697
that would.

4125
04:16:10,697 --> 04:16:18,293
KHARY: I was really disappointed in Nott for a
while, and then she ran up there and did what no

4126
04:16:18,293 --> 04:16:19,488
one else would.

4127
04:16:19,488 --> 04:16:21,742
MARISHA and LAURA: Nott the Brave.

4128
04:16:21,742 --> 04:16:23,232
SAM: Nott the Stupid.

4129
04:16:23,232 --> 04:16:34,168
MATT: Thank you guys so much. Khary, thank you
again. Shakäste goes into the annals of Wildemount

4130
04:16:34,168 --> 04:16:38,504
history. Thank you guys so much for tuning in.
We'll be back here next Thursday to continue this

4131
04:16:38,504 --> 04:16:42,198
story. Until then, is it Thursday yet? Have a good
night.

4132
